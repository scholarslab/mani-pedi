<img src="assets/plantsticker.png" alt="plant in a small pot" class="inset" />

{{ site.title }} examines university teaching, life, and governance during the COVID-19 pandemic. In an interactive digital [story](URL), it asks users to make choices that engage issues of equity, accessibility, and mental health. And in an accompanying [manifesto](URL) it urges a whole-person approach to teaching, learning, and labor. 

## Project History

{{ site.title }} was created by the tenth cohort of [Praxis Fellows](http://praxis.scholarslab.org/) during the 2020-2021 academic year. 

This year’s Praxis team members know one another as faces on computer screens, kind WhatsApp messages, and pings on Slack. We know one another’s pets and we’ve seen inside one another’s homes, but we haven’t met one another in person. This is because, like many UVA students, staff, and faculty, we have met remotely on Zoom during the 2020-2021 academic year. For this reason, we’ve been intentional about building community among ourselves and outlining how we want to work together. Our [charter](https://amthomps1.github.io/twinecharter.html) is a reflection of our commitments to integrity, community, equity, and play. {{ site.title }}, similarly, grew out of these commitments, as well as our ever-present concern for the broader university community. We are anxious for each other and ourselves, and beyond this, there is grief everywhere we turn, even if we have not yet been able to acknowledge it fully. So we respond with kindness and intentionality. We respond with this project. We respond with action.

{{ site.title }} is inspired by the digital teaching and learning practices that became necessary after the University of Virginia [announced](https://news.virginia.edu/content/latest-updates-uvas-response-coronavirus#march-11) that it would be moving all classes online on March 11, 2020. This pandemic pivots on individual days, on the painful disruption of knowing that, just 24 hours before, our lives were different. We bring this knowledge of a day’s impact to this project and ask that you, too, consider the magnitude of a single day.

Our project website makes ample use of the handwriting and illustrations of praxis fellows: 

<p>This is Grace’s handwriting.</p>
<p class='Emma'>This is Emma’s handwriting.</p>
<p>This is Elise’s handwriting.</p>
<p class='Crystal'>This is Crystal’s handwriting</p>
<p>This is Savanna’s handwriting.</p>
<p>And this is Aaron’s handwriting.</p>

We wanted the project to feel handcrafted, because it is – {{ site.title }} is shaped by the hands, intentions, experiences, and biases of its makers. While we remain remote from each other, we extend our hands to each other and to you. 

## Project Goals

The goals of {{ site.title }} are to:
* Create empathy-driven community
* Compel action and decision-making 
* Remind each visitor to this site of our interconnectedness

## The Scholars’ Lab 

[The Scholars’ Lab](https://scholarslab.lib.virginia.edu/) was established in 2006 by the [University of Virginia Library](https://www.library.virginia.edu/) as a site for the practice of experimental scholarship in all fields informed by digital humanities, spatial technologies, and cultural heritage thinking. The Scholars' Lab is a place where faculty and students can explore digital resources, find expert help, and collaborate on innovative research projects. The SLab also hosts [events](https://scholarslab.lib.virginia.edu/events/) such as workshops, talks, and roundtables, and sponsors the [Praxis Program](https://scholarslab.lib.virginia.edu/praxis-program-fellowships/) and the [Digital Humanities Fellows Program](https://scholarslab.lib.virginia.edu/digital-humanities-fellows/). 

## The Praxis Program 

Each year, the Scholars’ Lab funds a cohort of doctoral students from across the Graduate School of Arts & Sciences to serve as Praxis Fellows for the academic year. During the fall semester, fellows receive training in [digital methods and tools](https://github.com/scholarslab/CodeLab) and collaborative project management. During the spring semester, fellows conceive, develop, publish, and promote a digital project. This year, the Scholars’ Lab charged the Praxis Fellows with creating a project focused on digital pedagogy.
