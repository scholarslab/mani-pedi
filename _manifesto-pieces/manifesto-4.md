***Instructors’ desire to replicate the physical conditions of a classroom during the pandemic--what we have termed “classroomification”--has too often manifested itself in the urge to surveil and police our students as they go about their remote learning. This includes the use of software such as Proctorio and Turnitin, but also extends to smaller practices such as forcing students to keep their cameras on during Zoom classes or requiring all students to take exams at the same time, regardless of time zone differences.***
