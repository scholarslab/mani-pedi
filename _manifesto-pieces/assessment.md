The unhealthy social and psychological impact of traditional letter grades was put on full display during the pandemic. Students struggled to maintain high academic performance under disruptive and even traumatic circumstances. As a result, the University made the decision in the Spring 2020 semester to move to a default Credit/No-Credit (CR/NC) grading system, which allowed students to choose whether they wanted a traditional letter grade or not prior to final exams. The stated goals for this policy were to reduce stress and anxiety among students and ease the transition to remote learning. In her letter explaining the University’s decision, Provost Liz Magill asked students to “focus as much as possible on their health, their well-being, and that of their loved ones, and, in their classes, focus on the learning.”[^18]

This move to prioritize student well-being over grades under what were understood as “extraordinary circumstances” was necessary, but begged a larger question: when do extraordinary circumstances end? The University had initially planned to revert to standard grading practices by Fall 2020, but many students and faculty clearly felt this was premature. 1,400 students signed an open letter calling for the extension of CR/NC grading, while UVA’s Student Council distributed a survey on grading options where almost 70% of students “anticipated barriers to learning in the Fall 2020 semester.”[^19] By October, the University was convinced by this activism to extend the CR/NC option, first for the Fall 2020 semester and later through Summer Session 2021.[^20]

These decisions and their grounding in their overwhelmingly positive reception among students should prompt us to question what purpose traditional letter grades and GPAs were serving prior to the pandemic. Rather than jumping to the assumption that normal circumstances should prompt a return to letter grades, we believe now is an ideal time to consider the impact letter grades were having on higher education and whether we can implement lasting alternatives. 
The culture of perfectionism and high achievement is pervasive throughout the United States’ higher ed system. Among public universities in particular, UVA may be one of the more self-consciously competitive institutions, with its <a href="https://admission.virginia.edu/admission/statistics">selective admissions process</a> and <a href="https://www.virginia.edu/facts">pride in its high national rankings</a>. Many of the students coming to UVA were high-achievers in high school: for the entering class of 2019, 90% of students reported being in the top 10% of their graduating high school class.[^21]

Having both taught and studied here, we recognize the incredible strain students are placed under to do well in what can often be a highly competitive academic environment. Yet in much of higher ed, “doing well” has become conflated almost exclusively with getting good grades and a high GPA. The pursuit of letter grades has now come to define students’ classroom experiences at the expense of learning itself. Letter grades as commonly implemented encourage an adversarial relationship between students and instructors and competition rather than collaboration between students and their peers. As a result, classrooms can become hostile rather than encouraging environments. As author and educator Alfie Kohn has argued, competition is inimical to healthy learning; it causes students to “become dependent on external sources of evaluation” (such as grades) rather than an internal sense of drive or accomplishment. Moreover, certain competitive models of assessing students--such as grading on a curve--assume that some students will fail while others succeed.[^22]

Furthermore, the pursuit of grades transforms what is often labor-intensive work--writing essays, conducting research--into oversimplified tokens of participation. This not only produces unfair evaluations of students’ efforts, but provides perverse incentives for expending that effort to begin with. During the Fall campaign for extending CR/NC, the <i>Cavalier Daily</i> reported some professors expressing “worries that students will stop attending classes and engaging with their peers once they have done the bare minimum to obtain their credit.”[^23] Yet social scientific research has demonstrated repeatedly that traditional letter grades are what encourage a “path of least resistance” attitude towards learning. The more latitude students are given to focus on <i>what they’re doing</i> as opposed to <i>how they’re doing</i>, as Alfie Kohn puts it, the more they learn and retain.[^24]

At UVA and elsewhere, CR/NC also offered many students a greater sense of safety as they navigated the challenges of pandemic. 2020 Student Council president Ellen Yates reported that “[the] significant majority of students on a scale of one to ten, rated their satisfaction with their [choice of grading option], eight or higher… We have significant evidence to show that students actually were really happy with this system.”[^25] As we argue throughout this Manifesto, the circumstances students went through may become less common as the pandemic passes, but few of them will disappear entirely. Students will continue to struggle with mental illness, technological barriers, financial anxiety, and family problems. 

Students will also continue to come into the classroom with a wide range of experiences, knowledge, and abilities. Grades suppress and, at their worst, punish this diversity. In the humanities, this dynamic is perhaps most apparent when assessing students’ writing. Scholar of English and rhetoric Asao Inoue points out how most writing assessment uses a single standard of quality--usually one informed by white norms and discourses--to judge every student’s work.[^26] Inoue also highlights the lack of consent on the part of the student in these situations. The student has no say, and often no understanding, of the criteria by which their work is being judged.

Lastly, we also wish to highlight the negative effects grades have on instructors. The labor of giving out grades is both time consuming and alienating for many teaching staff, and often serves to satisfy administrative requirements more than pedagogical ones. During the pandemic, while students were asked to keep up with coursework, faculty were asked to keep up with designing, teaching, and grading coursework as well. We argue that instructors’ time and energy was, and is, best spent on developing healthy instructional dynamics with their students. These healthy dynamics are impeded by grades, which reinforce a hierarchical relationship between teachers and students. Meanwhile, the physical labor of grad<i>ing</i> either <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/blogs/just-visiting/i-have-seen-glories-grading-contract">occupies time better spent working with students directly</a> or is passed on to (frequently underpaid) graduate students.

<div id="assessment">
For the sake of both student and instructor wellbeing, and a healthier, more holistic approach to pedagogy in general, we call for a serious rethinking of grades and their function at UVA. To instructors, we provide the following resources about alternative methods of assessment which invite greater student participation in the process of grading.  
</div>

- Labor based contract grading:
  - <a href="http://tinyurl.com/uoantiracisthandout">Asao Inoue's method</a>
  - <a href="https://www.hastac.org/blogs/cathy-davidson/2015/08/16/getting-started-6-contract-grading-and-peer-review">Cathy Davidson's method</a>
- <a href="https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ815370.pdf">Student self-assessment</a>
- <a href="https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.567.4718&rep=rep1&type=pdf">Minimal grading</a>


While implementing these methods in our classrooms is a necessary first step towards what Jesse Stommel describes as “collectively worrying the edges of grading as a system,” they do not address the institutional requirements and incentives held in place by University policy. We argue that the principles which led UVA to adopt the CR/NC option for the 2020-2021 Academic Year must continue to operate moving forward. In order to create a more equitable, accessible, and ultimately effective community of learning, UVA must move towards abolishing grades. To this end, we demand the following:  

- That the University adopt a permanent and universal CR/NC option for all student work, as implemented at <a href="https://www.brown.edu/about/administration/registrar/course-enrollment/grades">Brown University</a>, <a href="https://soundcloud.com/benningtoncollege/what-an-a-cant-tell-you">Bennington College</a>, <a href="https://www.antioch.edu/resources/general-information/consumer-information/">Antioch University</a>, and other institutions of higher ed.
- That the University eliminate all grade point averages and the Dean’s List.
- That the University free up the financial resources necessary for schools and departments to hire more full-time, tenure track faculty from more diverse backgrounds to facilitate smaller class sizes and the possibility of more written feedback and more personalized assessment styles.
- That the University permanently waive the standardized testing requirement for admissions rather than only waiving it for only two years.[^27]

Finally, to our fellow students, we ask the following:
<ul>
    <li>If you run into an instructor or an institution which offers alternatives to traditional grading, treat it with an open mind. GPAs and other tokens of competitive academic performance are better markers of able bodiedness, material wealth, racial privilege, and other social inequities than they are of your performance. That doesn’t mean that if you have a 4.0 at UVA you didn’t earn it; rather, it demonstrates there are better methods of describing your intellectual needs and accomplishments such as  written instructor feedback and self-assessment.</li>
    <li>Look for instructors and courses that honor your effort, rather than encourage you to seek shortcuts. Learning is work, and our methods of assessment should reflect the labor you put into your assignments and coursework.</li>
</ul>
