***The unhealthy social and psychological impact of traditional letter grades was put on full display during the pandemic. Students struggled to maintain high academic performance under disruptive and even traumatic circumstances. As a result, the University made the decision in the Spring 2020 semester to move to a default Credit/No-Credit (CR/NC) grading system, which allowed students to choose whether they wanted a traditional letter grade or not prior to final exams. The stated goals for this policy were to reduce stress and anxiety among students and ease the transition to remote learning. In her letter explaining the University’s decision, Provost Liz Magill asked students to “focus as much as possible on their health, their well-being, and that of their loved ones, and, in their classes, focus on the learning.”*** <a href="#test-link-three"></a>
