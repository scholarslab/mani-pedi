Even if we only think of pedagogy as what happens in the classroom – a perspective this Manifesto expressly argues against, but one its authors recognize many people adopt – we must still acknowledge that pedagogy is work, both for instructors and for students. It deserves to be framed, discussed, and compensated in those terms. While education workers often talk about our love for our jobs and our students before all else, the truth is that more often than not, [the work will not love us back](https://www.teenvogue.com/story/sarah-jaffe-work-wont-love-you-back-book). Indeed, love for the work is something our employers weaponize against us to justify paying us smaller wages, granting fewer benefits, and denying us stable employment.[^38]

<div id="gradlabor">
Like many peer institutions of higher ed, UVA does not always talk about the people it employs in terms of the labor they do for the University. A 2020 announcement for graduate teaching awards, for instance, refers to graduate students’ teaching as “part of their training,” and Teaching Assistants (TAs) themselves as “<a href="https://news.virginia.edu/content/theres-something-makes-these-graduate-instructors-special">budding professors</a>” (ignoring whether those students are indeed able to become professional academics).  While TA-ing is indeed a valuable part of many graduate students’ education, it also provides essential labor for the University. Large courses with complex assignments require teams of graders; labs and studios require trained assistants; small college writing courses require dedicated instructors.
</div>   

The University’s tendency towards euphemism regarding its teaching workforce is particularly apparent in how it describes its contingent faculty. Workers who may be categorized by another institution as “adjuncts”--that is to say, faculty who are ineligible for tenure--are referred to as “general faculty” or “Wage Faculty Employees” at UVA.[^40] Both terms manage to avoid visions of precarity, low pay, and lessened prestige many of us now associate with “adjunct” while keeping those conditions intact. 

Non-teaching labor is just as essential to the functioning of the University and the fulfillment of its pedagogical mission, but is often even more precarious, poorly compensated, and at times, taken for granted. When UVA promised its students an “on-Grounds experience” last Fall, it relied on the in-person labor of custodians, food service workers, librarians, and support staff to make that experience happen. Yet unlike faculty and some student employees, UVA’s frontline workers were not given the choice to stay home while keeping their jobs. Like employers across the country, UVA has thanked these essential workers for their service while repeatedly neglecting to give them hazard pay. Moreover, some workers with the choice to stay remote have reported feeling pressured to work in-person before they felt fully safe doing so. “People are feeling rather expendable and sacrificial,” one employee told a local reporter.[^41]
<div id="faclabor">
<p>We simply cannot imagine good pedagogy being produced under such precarious conditions. This does not mean workers aren’t giving their all – in many cases, faculty, staff, and other employees have given everything they have and more. Rather, it means that the University’s leaders did not create the necessary safety nets to support and sustain these workers when the pandemic and all its challenges arrived. The already extraordinary demands of research, instruction, administration, and other forms of university labor became all the more difficult when workers also needed to watch their chilidren, take on additional care work, and worry about their personal safety at work.</p> 
</div>

All this speaks to the fact that, while the particular stresses and circumstances of the past year have been somewhat unique, the underlying causes for worker dissatisfaction and exploitation at UVA are much older. It was only in 2019 that President Ryan raised the hourly wage of full time workers at UVA to $15 an hour, a victory won by student and worker activists after decades of organizing.[^42] Student workers continue to be excluded from this policy, with our hourly minimum wage remaining at [$9.50 an hour](https://provost.virginia.edu/wage-authorization-academic-areas).

Low pay is just one of many ways in which the University devalues those who work in its most critical positions. The janitor who cleans the classroom, the dining worker who serves students their meals, the technicians who maintain our electronic devices, the nurses and doctors treating students at Student Health, all have as much a hand in fulfilling the mission of the University as faculty and teaching staff. Yet rarely do we see these workers treated with the respect – nevermind given the compensation – they deserve. Instead, they’re inevitably the first to lose pay, lose shifts, and [lose jobs when money is tight](https://www.cavalierdaily.com/article/2020/04/u-va-contracted-aramark-workers-laid-off-without-severance-notice-amid-covid-19-facility-closures). Many of these workers are employed through private contractors such as Aramark, a company known for its [unfair and discriminatory labor practices](https://www.corp-research.org/aramark). Privatization itself is a shift away from equitable labor standards, as wage workers from Charlottesville – many of them Black and Brown women – are left with jobs with the least security and the lowest pay.[^43]

<div id="justice">
As a public institution of higher education, we believe UVA should set the standard for worker compensation, benefits, workplace safety, and job security in the Commonwealth. Not only would this be an enormous step towards fulfilling the University’s stated commitment to racial and gender equity; it would promote the level of pedagogical excellence the University continuously aspires to achieve. The uneven impacts of the pandemic will doubtless resonate throughout higher ed for years to come. Already, we're seeing staggering job losses--<a href="https://www.chronicle.com/article/a-brutal-tally-higher-ed-lost-650-000-jobs-last-year">over 650,000 since the start of the pandemic</a>-with <a href="https://www.chronicle.com/article/heres-who-was-hit-hardest-by-higher-eds-pandemic-driven-job-losses">low-paid staffers, workers of color, and women suffering the majority of these cutbacks.</a> In other words, the workers who already take on <a href="https://thebaffler.com/salvos/who-cares-jaffe">the majority of care work, both at home, in our schools, and in our economy at large, are the first to be put on the chopping block.</a> We call on UVA to defy these trends rather than give in to them.
</div>  

We therefore demand:
* That the University immediately raises all minimum wages, including those for student employees, to $15/hour and commits to future annual wage increases based on the rising cost of living in Charlottesville.
* That the University terminates its contracts with Aramark and other private contractors and rehires all workers as direct employees. 
* That the University compensates its workers with hazard pay for all hours worked in-person since the beginning of the pandemic in March 2020 to the end of Summer 2021.

To our fellow instructors, the work of improving our conditions at the University begins with recognizing our own jobs as ***work***. Only after we embrace the power that our position as workers gives us can we begin to use it in ways which benefit ourselves and our coworkers. While UVA has not yet embraced adjunctification to the extent that certain other institutions of higher education have, the unequal treatment of wage, general, and tenured and tenure-track faculty points to the University’s cost-based priorities when it comes to hiring and compensating instructors. Instructors must resist any further efforts to expand wage/general faculty positions, both through already existing modes of faculty governance and through renewed alliances between various work classifications. As professor and activist Chris Newfield writes, “Instead of looking to senior management for defense, faculty members should look to employees in other workplaces in advocating democratic rather than autocratic organization.”[^44]

To our fellow students, we similarly ask that you take advantage of the tremendous collective power we all hold. If you haven’t already, get involved with some of the following organizations:
* [UVA RAs](https://twitter.com/uva_ra)
* [UCWVA](https://www.ucwva.org/)
* [UVA Mutual Aid](https://www.uvastudco.com/uva-mutual-aid)
* [YDSA at UVA](https://atuva.student.virginia.edu/organization/youngdemocraticsocialists)

Remember that without undergraduate and graduate student labor, UVA would quite literally cease to function.

[^40]: Faculty Wage Employees are defined as faculty “hired to complete a short-term and/or part-time academic work assignment, such as teaching one or more courses for one or two academic terms.” Wage faculty are exempt from the Fair Labor Standards Act, which governs minimum wages and overtime. See “Faculty Appointments and Employment,” Office of the Executive Vice President and Provost, accessed May 3, 2021, [https://provost.virginia.edu/faculty-handbook/faculty-appointments-and-employment](https://provost.virginia.edu/faculty-handbook/faculty-appointments-and-employment), and “PROV-026: Faculty Wage Employment,” Policy Directory, accessed May 3, 2021, [https://uvapolicy.virginia.edu/policy/PROV-026](https://uvapolicy.virginia.edu/policy/PROV-026). General faculty are faculty members who are ineligible for tenure but who work on longer (generally three year) appointments. According to UVA, the term as currently used arose in the 1970s and can encompass a wide range of titles and positions, from Lecturer to Librarian. See “PROV-004: Employment of Academic General Faculty Members (Tenure-Ineligible),” Policy Directory, accessed May 3, 2021, [https://uvapolicy.virginia.edu/policy/PROV-004](https://uvapolicy.virginia.edu/policy/PROV-004).

Since 2019, the cost of living in Charlottesville has continued to rise. The Economic Policy Institute’s “Family Budget Calculator” puts a single, childless adult’s annual costs at $38,839, or over $18/hr working full time. MIT’s Living Wage Calculator puts its estimate for a living wage in Charlottesville slightly  lower at $15.63/hour for a single, childless adult.
