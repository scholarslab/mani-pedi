The present state of digital pedagogy at UVA seems to many teachers and students to be a grim landscape. The future of digital pedagogy, however, is what we choose to make of it. To demonstrate a possible version of that future, the six of us we offer our own year in the Scholars’ Lab as a counterexample. 

The six of us have spent the past academic year meeting remotely, two to three times a week, to learn entirely new skills with an almost entirely new group of people. We are all fully funded, with finances dealt with in an upfront and transparent way. We had assignments with flexible deadlines and no grades, were encouraged to collaborate, and deliberately fostered an environment of mutual care, respect, and friendship. We established connections over Zoom, WeChat, Slack, and Discord, had movie and game nights, and met all of one another’s pets. We became friends.

We don’t think we’ve succeeded at building a community because we’re special people. Rather, we were given the necessary environment in which to flourish, in spite of the chaos in our lives and in the world. We succeeded because, as Brandon Walsh kept reminding us, “You’re already successes in our eyes.” 

What would the past two semesters at UVA have looked like if every administrator, instructor, and student had approached the pedagogical experience along these lines? If decision-makers had looked at online learning, not as a financial opportunity or a challenge to be forced onto teachers and students, but as a space to try new ways of relating to and experiencing education? Would they have felt so pressured to bring students back to put themselves, University employees, and the surrounding community at risk? Would professors have kept up strict grading and deadline policies? Would students have struggled so much to feel they were learning and building community from afar?

Very few of the issues we’ve outlined here are unique to UVA. However, we feel it is important to highlight how these big structures manifest in local and specific ways, shaped by local histories of domination and resistance. We do this to establish how connected we all are to the problem, but also how close we are to the solutions.
