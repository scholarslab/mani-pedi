Many instructors, ourselves included, consider teaching students about social inequalities and resistance towards them an essential part of what we do in the classroom. This practice can be limited, however, by the context of the institutions within which we learn and teach. The past year in particular has seen a renewed public reckoning with racial inequality in its many violent forms, a reckoning the University of Virginia itself has sought to engage with and take part in. Part of this process has involved a public accounting for UVA's violent history of upholding white supremacist, eugenicist, and colonial ideologies.[^33] Yet that history is reproduced daily in the labor and social relations of the University, as well as in the University’s larger relationship with the surrounding city of Charlottesville and its permanent residents.[^34] 

How, then, do we teach and learn about resisting or unmaking oppressive hierarchies from our position within this University? We know that people, organizations, and institutions at UVA are committed to improving the University’s record on racial justice, particularly its treatment of Black and Brown students, workers, and community members. We want to use this space to point to some of these ongoing efforts, from which we have drawn many of the following resources and suggestions.

* [Racial Equity Task Force](https://racialequity.virginia.edu/)
* [Equity Center](https://virginiaequitycenter.org/)
* [Religion, Race, and Democracy Lab](https://religionlab.virginia.edu/)
* [Democracy Initiative](https://democracyinitiative.virginia.edu/)
* [Black Student Alliance](https://www.bsaatuva.com/)
* [President’s Commission on the University in the Age of Segregation](https://segregation.virginia.edu/)

At the same time, there is a deep contradiction between some of the University’s rhetoric and the structural position of the University as a political and economic institution, a contradiction which has great consequences for the pedagogical work the University ostensibly exists to enable. We watched this tension play out in the school’s recent decision to bring back thousands of undergraduate students for in-person classes in Fall of 2020, prioritizing student experience (and the University's own bottom line) over the health and safety of Charlottesville residents, particularly Black and Brown workers at the University. The University leadership's decision must be placed into 1) the greater context of historic harm UVA has inflicted upon low-income and minority residents in Charlottesville;[^35] and 2) the broader social impact of the pandemic, [during which Black and Brown people working high-risk jobs have gotten ill and died at higher rates than the general population](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/29/magazine/racial-disparities-covid-19.html). 

The University's response to the COVID-19 pandemic is not the only way in which UVA still, at this very moment, reinforces racial, economic, and other inequalities. We could further point to the University’s embeddedness within the [prison industrial complex](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2020/02/14/public-universities-several-states-are-required-buy-prison-industries), its use of an armed police force which [disproportionately arrests Black and Brown residents and students](https://www.cavalierdaily.com/article/2020/08/my-anxiety-was-kicking-in-examining-the-fraught-relationship-between-students-of-color-and-the-police-at-u-va), and – [as argued by our preceding Praxis cohort](https://landandlegacy.scholarslab.org/index.html) – its direct involvement in the depletion of affordable housing in Charlottesville.

This tension cannot, we argue, be resolved solely with initiatives that originate from within the power holders of the University. Philosopher Sara Ahmed has described the limitations of University-commissioned reports and statements which turn naming a condition--in this case, the University’s racism--into a “claim to have overcome the conditions.”[^36] Lasting solutions to the condition of structural oppression necessitate a combination of  worker, student, and tenant power. UVA’s own Racial Equity Task Force gestured towards this truth when, in response to being asked for “thoughtful and bold recommendations for racial equity” by President Ryan, they assembled a long, interactive timeline of calls to action from “students, faculty, staff, and working groups” since the 1960s. While we continue to organize outside the strict boundaries of our academic lives towards these ends, we also use this space to reiterate some of those calls to action. 

We demand:
* That the University terminates its long-term private contracts with corporations such as Aramark and rehire all currently contracted workers as direct employees.
* That the University immediately raises all minimum wages, including those for student employees, to $15/hour and base all future wage increases on the rising cost of living in Charlottesville.
* That, in the words of the 2019-2020 Praxis Cohort, the University [“consider the actions and policies of the UVA Foundation and its subsidiaries when evaluating the impact of the University on local communities”](https://landandlegacy.scholarslab.org/future-directions.html). This is especially critical with regard to the impact of the Foundation’s land-buying practices on local housing availability and affordability.
* That the University keep its [promise to support the development of up to 1,500 affordable housing units in Charlottesville by 2030](https://augustafreepress.com/uva-commits-to-ambitious-affordable-housing-goal/), and that it does so in partnership with low-income and unhoused residents and their advocates such as the Public Housing Association of Residents and the Low Income Housing Coalition.
* That the University admit an [undergraduate](https://racialequity.virginia.edu/sites/g/files/jsddwu356/files/2020-08/RETFFinalSigned.pdf) and graduate student body which reflects the racial and gender demographics of the Commonwealth of Virginia.
* That the University set aside a permanent endowment to fund scholarships both for the descendents of enslaved workers who helped build and maintain UVA, and members of the Monacan Indian Nation, on whose stolen land the University sits.[^37] 

Whatever UVA does or does not choose to do in the short term, it nevertheless remains a critical part of instructors’ mission at the University to ensure that students have a context through which to understand their social surroundings and the forces which shape them. As digital humanists in training, we see a lot of possibility in how digital tools and projects can fit into this pedagogical mission, but we have our reservations as well. In particular, we are concerned about the increased use of certain digital technologies without attendant frameworks through which students and teachers can interrogate them. <a href="#classroomification-accordion">What assumptions do they carry? What inequities do they reproduce? What norms do they reinforce?</a> Though people sometimes talk about the digital and the online as separate from "the real world," the two are in fact very much intertwined. As media and African American studies scholar Safiya Noble [writes](https://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/read/untitled-f2acf72c-a469-49d8-be35-67f9ac1e3a60/section/5aafe7fe-db7e-4ec1-935f-09d8028a2687), "We can no longer deny that digital tools and projects are implicated in the rise in global inequality, because digital systems are reliant on global racialized labor exploitation. We can no longer pretend that digital infrastructures are not linked to crises like global warming and impending ecological disasters."[^38] The solution, as Noble describes it, lies in neither ceding nor uncritically embracing the digital. Rather, digital humanities and other related fields must be deliberately engaged in "immediate and pressing global concerns" of racial, economic, and political oppression; ***and*** scholars and actors in those fields must be engaged with the digital, to take part in interrogating its biases and addressing its shortcomings. 

For instructors who do not consider themselves scholars of race or racism but are looking to these subjects into their classrooms; for scholars interested in critical digital humanities; we share the following resources as one possible place to start.

* Histories of race, white supremacy, and antiracist organizing in UVA and Charlottesville: 
    * [***Charlottesville 2017: The Legacy of Race and Inequality***, ed. Dr. Claudrena Harold and Dr. Louis P. Nelson](https://www.upress.virginia.edu/title/5326): A collection of essays by faculty members at UVA reflecting on the events of August 11th and 12th, 2017 and their wider context. 
    * “[The Charlottesville Syllabus](https://medium.com/@UVAGSC/the-charlottesville-syllabus-9e01573419d0)”: "A resource created by the Graduate Student Coalition for Liberation to be used to educate readers about the long history of white supremacy in Charlottesville, Virginia."
    * "[Voices for Equity](http://voicesforequity.virginiaequitycenter.org/)": A living, interactive timeline of "calls to action made by students, faculty, and community members through protests, petitions, and working groups" for racial equity at UVA, compiled by the UVA Equity Center.
    * "[Mapping Cville](https://mappingcville.com/)": A digital mapping project visualizing multiple forms of inequality in Charlottesville created by Jordy Yager for the Jefferson School African-American Heritage Center. Yager is currently "plotting every single deed in the city that contains a racist covenant within it."

* Modern Language Association's "Digital Pedagogy in the Humanities" -- [Keyword "Race," curated by Dr. Viola Lasmana and Dr. Adeline Koh](https://digitalpedagogy.hcommons.org/keyword/Race): A collection of syllabi and digital projects on teaching and learning about issues of race and identity in the classroom. 

* "[Making a Case for the Black Digital Humanities](https://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/read/untitled/section/fa10e2e1-0c3d-4519-a958-d823aac989eb)" by Kim Gallon: An article by historian and digital humanist Kim Gallon on using Black studies to think through both the "digital" and the "humanities" of the digital humanities.

* "[The Political Power of Play](https://hybridpedagogy.org/political-power-of-play/)" by Adeline Koh: An article by scholar Adeline Koh on the importance of games, play, and creative exercise in the process of learning about oppressive structures and systems. 

Lastly, antiracist pedagogy in the classroom can and must work in tandem with organizing the enormous workplace that is UVA to be more equitable and democratic. In addition to participating in local organizations committed to combating the effects of structural racism, we must also engage in workplace organizing, particularly forms which build commonality between our own positions and those of staff at the University. In conjunction with this, we must also build lasting ties to the Charlottesville community in which most of us live, become engaged citizens who vote in local elections, attend city government meetings, and generally take part in the civic and social life of the city.

To our fellow students: organizing is critical to fighting back against the racist, patriarchal, and otherwise oppressive incentives which still hold sway at UVA. Yet effective organizing without a strong and genuine sense of community is impossible. As each other’s best advocates, talk to and learn about your fellow students. If you have the capacity and the privilege of spare time, become engaged members of the UVA community who vote in student elections, serve as active members of student organizations, and generally take part in the University’s civic and social life. Listen and collaborate with longtime residents, who know best what they need. We can’t  let our limited time at UVA become an excuse to not get involved. As an institution, the University counts on us not staying engaged. Resist!
