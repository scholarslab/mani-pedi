***Who makes decisions at the University, and how is it governed? For an institution which has recently invested so much financial and intellectual capital in the study of democracy, UVA – like most workplaces in the United States – remains a deeply undemocratic institution. Decisions are made in a top-down manner without the input of the vast majority of students and workers who study and work here, much less residents in the surrounding city who must live with the consequences of these decisions.*** <a href="#test-link-seven"></a>
