Who makes decisions at the University, and how is it governed? For an institution which has recently invested so much financial and intellectual capital in the study of democracy, UVA – [like most workplaces in the United States](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/bob-black-the-abolition-of-work/) – remains a deeply undemocratic institution. Decisions are made in a top-down manner without the input of the vast majority of students and workers who study and work here, much less residents in the surrounding city who must live with the consequences of these decisions. 

<div id="power">
Social hierarchies of white supremacy and heteropatriarchy, hierarchical labor relations, hierarchies of nationality, and so on. For this reason, not all students are equally powerless (or powerful); some are given more permission to act freely than others. Many Black students worry about the potential violence behind every exchange with University Ambassadors; <a href="https://twitter.com/BeyondUva/status/1362145210743062530">white students may ask them to take a picture of their friend group</a>. UVA fraternity members may act recklessly and <a href="https://www.cavalierdaily.com/article/2021/02/u-va-confirms-covid-19-violations-are-being-brought-against-five-fraternities">help bring about COVID lockdown restrictions</a>, whose potential penalties have a history of being enforced more heavily among the University’s Black and Brown student body. These dynamics have become even more fraught during the pandemic as students are asked to surveil and police one another's behavior, either as <a href="https://www.c-ville.com/read-em-and-weep-uva-library-employees-fear-for-their-safety">University</a> <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/105-BM14US86B0tSfU_2AnETogObAvPgnoxDKfs11g1U/edit">workers</a> or as "<a href="https://uvaemergency.virginia.edu/netbadge/covid-19-compliance-reporting">engaged bystanders</a>" within the UVA community. Yet as we argue <a href="#classroomification">elsewhere</a> in this Manifesto, giving students the institutional means to punish each other often reproduces pre-existing social hierarchies rather than circumventing them.

There is no straightforward solution to these inequities at UVA, not only because UVA is an institution which still produces and benefits from these inequities, but because UVA is not an island. Nevertheless, efforts for change within the University are still worth pursuing. If one of the missions of the public university is to teach students how to be good citizens of the world, then surely lessons in democratic self-governance must take priority. 

By this we do not merely mean the lessons some students learn through participating in the Student Council, a body which our incoming Student Council President Abel Liu has argued is less engaged in traditional governance than in spearheading students’ collective bargaining with the University’s administrators.[^47] Similarly, we envision even more than giving students and workers a seat at the table. Students, workers, and the surrounding community must gradually seize more and more collective power within the University which they create and with which they must live.

To that end we demand:

* A vote for both the student and the faculty representative on the Board of Visitors.
* Elections of all higher level University administrative positions, from Deans up to the President, by students and workers at the University. 

To our fellow instructors: Most of us have learned by now that the classroom is not free from governance. Just as University policies alternately weigh us down or free us up in the work of teaching, so do our policies influence our students’ work of learning. As facilitators, our choices can create an environment of inclusion or exclusion, of respect or fear. Tools of inclusion and respect, such as contract grading and a student-designed syllabus, can help ensure the educational process is constructive for all involved. More broadly, we echo bell hooks’ assertion that “any radical pedagogy must insist that everyone’s presence is acknowledged… the professor must genuinely value everyone’s presence.”[^48] Instructors must learn to resist the tendency in higher education to see our [students as customers](https://www.insidehighered.com/views/2014/02/27/essay-critiques-how-student-customer-idea-erodes-key-values-higher-education) and [ourselves as service providers](https://www.chronicle.com/article/faculty-members-are-not-cashiers/); to instead meet our students as peers and intellectual collaborators.

To our fellow students: Both during and before the pandemic, we have seen student power wrest significant reforms and resources from the University towards the collective good. During the past year, students have applied our collective power to winning CR/NC grading, getting greater workplace protections for RAs, and fighting for a tuition freeze in the Spring. We hope as our power grows, so do our [aims and ambitions](https://y.dsausa.org/the-activist/why-tuition-strikes-matter/).
