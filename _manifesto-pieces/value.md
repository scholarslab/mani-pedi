This past year’s student campaign for an undergraduate tuition freeze at UVA raised a range of questions regarding the monetary value of a digital education. Students feel they are not getting what they were promised while attending Zoom University: no in-person mentoring from professors, no valuable connections with peers, no enriching experiences in the cities and towns their schools are located in. As the pandemic continued into Fall of 2020, tuition-paying students at UVA and elsewhere started questioning [what it was, exactly, they were paying tens of thousands of dollars for](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/14/colleges-move-online-amid-coronavirus-but-forget-a-tuition-discount.html). 

These calls for reduced tuition during the pandemic, often framed by students and their parents as wanting to pay less for an inferior product, sparked anger and frustration among many university instructors who identified students as misunderstanding the purpose of tuition. “[The tuition isn’t paying the ‘bills’ as you might imagine it](https://twitter.com/tressiemcphd/status/1280237922994860033),” sociologist Tressie McMillan Cottom wrote in a Tweet pointing out that the majority of tuition revenue at most universities goes directly towards paying for instruction. In other words, tuition is where most universities – public and private alike – find money to pay for the teaching labor on which their institutions run. This is no less true for UVA. Indeed, the fact was brought up at a [February Board of Visitors meeting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UvIurO7MqY&ab_channel=UVABoardofVisitors) as part of the University’s justification for proposing a tuition increase. Resources from that increase “would definitely be tied to compensation for our faculty and staff,” Vice President J. J. Davis announced.[^48]

The contest over freezing tuition over a perceived lesser product and appropriately compensating University staff for their labor is almost entirely the product of austerity and artificial scarcity. State funding for higher education has been [steadily](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/how-much-state-funding-does-the-university-of-virginia-receive/2013/09/12/fb999782-1baf-11e3-82ef-a059e54c49d0_story.html) [declining](https://digital.uvamagazine.org/articles/funding-academic-excellence/index.php) in Virginia (and elsewhere) for several decades. In the February 2021 Board of Visitors meeting where the Board discussed increasing tuition, Vice President Davis pointed out that “over the past thirty years we have seen the responsibility of higher education funding shift from the taxpayer – the state – to students and their families.”

In this scarcity environment, it is unsurprising that University employees would perceive student calls for tuition freezes and refunds as a threat to their own compensation. Yet multiple truths can hold simultaneously. A tuition freeze is just and needed; ***AND***, a virtual or remote education is not inherently inferior to an in-person one; ***AND***, austerity is a choice, not an economic inevitability. 

Education, especially public education, is a right. The added factor of an economic recession and soaring unemployment means that freezing – if not reducing – tuition for the foreseeable future is and was the only moral and equitable position the University can take. It is for this reason, not the inherent inferiority of remote learning and digital pedagogy, that the University’s decision to [freeze undergraduate tuition](https://news.virginia.edu/content/board-visitors-votes-freeze-base-undergraduate-tuition-2021-22-academic-year?utm_source=VirginiaFeatured&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=news) in the coming school year was the correct one.

Rather than painting all of online learning with the broad brush of being cheap—both fiscally and experientially—we offer an alternative explanation for why the past two semesters have felt so drained of value. As we have strived to show throughout this Manifesto, digital pedagogy is a robust and developed field of tools, practices, and perspectives which instructors have been making use of for years. Yet their efficacy and reception is fundamentally constrained by the conditions of higher education itself. Over the past year decision makers at UVA and elsewhere saw the pandemic as a crisis in which only new technologies were necessary, not new ways of using them. Schools kept in place pre-existing bad practices—harsh deadlines, strict grading policies, exploitative labor conditions, inequitable systems of governance—all while expecting their students to weather the stress of the pandemic and adapt to an unfamiliar mode of learning.

The financial cycle that UVA is currently caught in was not entirely of its own making, and the school has fought in many ways to remain affordable. The University’s continued commitment to meeting 100% of undergraduates’ demonstrated financial aid and its policy to offer admission to students “without regard to their ability to pay the cost of their education” make it rare among public universities in the United States. Yet these policies are the floor from which we build, not the ceiling of possibility. Now is the time for UVA and its representatives to take a strong, principled, and public stance on free public higher education. As we write, the “Free College for All Act” has been introduced in the U.S. Senate and, if passed, will “allow students from families earning under $125,000 a year to attend public colleges and universities tuition-free and debt-free.”[^49] If UVA’s current leadership wants to break out of its reliance on shrinking state funding and students’ tuition dollars, we believe they must put the institution’s significant political and economic influence to use in that direction.

Lastly, we’d like to nudge our fellow students to express our future demands around tuition and the cost of college in slightly different terms. We cannot keep capitulating to the idea of education as a consumer product. Rather, we must rediscover the idea of higher education as a [public good](https://www.dissentmagazine.org/article/tressie-mcmillan-cottom-why-free-college-necessary).
