<p>Instructors’ desires to replicate the physical conditions of a classroom during the pandemic--what we have termed “classroomification”--have too often ignored the exceptional circumstances our students have found themselves in over the course of this past year. Synchronous remote learning which maintains regular attendance practices, for instance, presumes that students have the same <a href="https://www.cavalierdaily.com/article/2020/09/lack-of-internet-access-continues-to-impact-students-online-learning-experiences">ready access to an internect connection</a>, a quiet environment, or just the mental capacity to participate in a live classroom setting. Even more worryingly, however, "classroomification" has also manifested itself in the urge to surveil and police our students as they go about their remote learning. This includes the use of software such as Proctorio and Turnitin, but also extends to smaller practices such as forcing students to keep their cameras on during Zoom classes.</p>

This suspicious and ultimately controlling approach towards students feeds into what Jeffrey Moro defines as "<a href="https://jeffreymoro.com/blog/2020-02-13-against-cop-shit/">cop shit</a>”: “any pedagogical technique or technology that presumes an adversarial relationship between students and teachers.” Educational technology like Proctorio that <a href="https://hybridpedagogy.org/our-bodies-encoded-algorithmic-test-proctoring-in-higher-education/">tracks student movement</a> certainly falls under this category, but so do militant tardy or absence policies, assignments that require copying out honor code statements, and any interface with actual cops, including reporting students’ immigration status to ICE or calling cops on students in classrooms.

Why are instructors incentivized to be mistrustful of their own students, particularly at an institution where student honor is so highly prized? Despite its intended purpose of upholding community trust, we argue that in practice, the honor system creates additional anxiety around academic misconduct without looking at its root causes. As currently implemented, University policy surrounding issues such as plagiarism feed into a pedagogical framework that is based on punishment instead of repair. In a society where punishment breaks disproportionately along the lines of race, class, and gender, we must strive to avoid systems and situations which reproduce what prison and police abolitionists have termed “carceral logic” if we are to address these inequities.[^28] We must instead look to restorative modes of justice and more egalitarian conceptualizations of community trust.

Trusting students is the result of strong interpersonal relationships and a more personal form of pedagogy, standards which are difficult to attain in person and can feel even more difficult to attain online. Yet there are no shortcuts to building healthy classrooms, virtual or otherwise. Proctoring software and other mechanisms which extend suspicion towards students on the part of the instructor only serve to further complicate this task. For this reason, we ask our fellow instructors--particularly faculty instructors who have total jurisdiction over their own courses--to avoid it entirely and, when possible, to raise the issue in your own departments with other professors. If your department or school has a contract with Proctorio or another proctoring service, consider lobbying for this contract to be terminated. Not only do such technologies make test taking and other academic work even more stressful than they were already; their programming has been shown to reproduce racist, ableist, and other structural biases.[^29]

Beyond simply rejecting antagonistic technologies, however, we also want to remind our fellow instructors to think of cheating as a symptom of larger problems, both in our students’ lives and in the way our University incentivizes certain forms of academic achievement. As such, we encourage you to embrace flexibility, both for yourself and your students, and to implement changes in course design such as rolling-deadlines to make assignments easier to complete as intended. As librarian and researcher Shea Swauger writes in <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/remote-testing-monitored-ai-failing-students-forced-undergo-it-ncna1246769">an essay against proctoring software</a>, “We need to stop believing that technology can solve complex social problems like cheating, and we need to start reframing our educational goals to center equity, compassion and trust. The future of online education depends on it.”

While we ask instructors to embrace flexibility and trust, we acknowledge that over the past year, UVA did not always sufficiently support its teaching staff to do that work from afar. Some of this was down to structures such as the Honor Code and letter grading we discussed earlier, but another important component was the way in which online learning was commonly discussed. Perhaps the most common refrain from University communications was that fully remote learning was fundamentally inadequate, so much so that students needed to be brought back to Charlottesville for some level of in person classes. “Our mission is to educate students, conduct research, and provide medical care,” Jim Ryan stated at an August town hall. “All of those things are better done in person, and students are involved in each part of that mission.”[^30] We absolutely do not argue for online learning as a meaningful substitute for in person classes. We do argue that framing online learning as necessarily inferior can feed into harmful notions of online learning being less rigorous, and thus requiring the strict oversight of software like Proctorio. “People are aware that cheating is more rampant [online],” last year’s chair of the University Honor Committee told <a href="https://www.cavalierdaily.com/article/2020/11/professors-implement-anti-cheating-software-diversify-exam-questions-in-effort-to-discourage-cheating-ahead-of-finals"><i>The Cavalier Daily</i></a>.[^31] Taken in the context of a global pandemic, this statement feels detached from struggling students’ daily realities, which continue to impact their studies and their relationship to coursework. Fluctuating academic performance--including cheating and other forms of misconduct--should be expected and handled with compassion, not surveillance.

Some of us in this year’s Praxis Cohort embarked on this project sharing in the belief that the digital space is a lesser imitation of the real world. As we’ve learned through both study and experience, however, <a href="#coda-accordion">it doesn’t have to be</a>. As more people come to experience it outside the confines of the pandemic, the six of us hope that instructors and students alike realize that digital pedagogy is valuable in and of itself, replete with its own challenges, joys, and responsibilities. The perceived value of digital pedagogy must not, as we’ll discuss in <a href="#value-accordion">greater detail elsewhere</a>, become a case for devaluing the work of teaching. In many cases, good digital pedagogy requires <i>more</i> labor than in-person teaching, not only from instructors ourselves, but from a wide network of support staff, whose contributions to higher education <a href="https://www.chronicle.com/article/stop-ignoring-microaggressions-against-your-staff">continue to be ignored or diminished</a>.[^32] We need more training and resources to ensure the tech ed infrastructure on which we rely are kept up-to-date and accessible. We need more time to make digital pedagogy comprehensive and engaging. We need more mental and emotional support so we can pass the same support on to our students from afar. All these resources go towards producing classrooms, both virtual or otherwise, as spaces of trust rather than surveillance.

For these reasons, we demand the following:

<ul>
    <li>That the University moves from a passive stance on proctoring software to actively discouraging its use.</li>
    <li>That the University follows through on the recommendation of the 2020 Racial Equity Task Force to “examine institutional biases within such student-led institutions as the Honor System, University Judicial Council, Judicial Review Board” with an eye towards total abolition, as any reform of a system which polices student behavior simply prolongs its ability to punish.</li>
</ul>

To our fellow students: if you’ve experienced a virtually proctored exam or a strict camera-on policy and found yourself feeling uncomfortable but weren’t sure why, we hope we’ve offered a way to describe and push back against this form of “classroomification.” If you want to look further into the development and use of “cop shit” like Proctorio, the fields of <a href="https://socialmediacollective.org/reading-lists/critical-algorithm-studies/">critical algorithm studies</a> and <a href="https://ojs.library.queensu.ca/index.php/surveillance-and-society">surveillance studies</a> may be of additional interest to you. If you want to find ways to end these programs’ presence at UVA, you will be far from alone, as <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/09/students-are-pushing-back-against-proctoring-surveillance-apps">university students across the country have authored petitions and open letters</a> demanding as much from their institutions. Though digital pedagogy is likely here to stay, surveillance technologies do not have to be a part of it.

We can see carceral logic at work in how UVA has set up its honor system to mirror the criminal justice system at large. Students accused of violating the honor code are brought before an <i>investigative panel</i>; if sufficient evidence is found, students undergo a <i>trial</i> during which they are found either <i>guilty</i> or <i>not guilty</i>. There is no inherent reason why issues of academic and other misconduct must be adjudicated in this manner--or adjudicated at all. While UVA’s system of having students act as judge and jury for one another avoids some pitfalls, it creates others. For one thing, students are far from immune to prejudice or bias, as figures on the disproportionately high sanction rate of students of color show.

In particular, webcam based technologies have demonstrated difficulty detecting dark skin, while keystroke analysis “can’t always accurately identify students who have certain physical disabilities or medical conditions.” Often, using anti-cheating software forces students to sit in place for the duration of an exam, further disadvantaging students who have physical disabilities (or who just need to use the restroom).
