What does equitable, empathy-driven digital education look like? 

This is the question at the center of [Project Title]. 

[Project Title] examines university teaching, life, and governance during the COVID-19 pandemic. In an interactive digital story, it asks users to make choices that engage issues of equity, accessibility, and mental health. In an accompanying manifesto, It urges a whole-person approach to teaching, learning, and labor. And it holds space for reflection and feedback [in a way I would love to expound upon but don’t know how to yet].

Project History

[Project Title] was created by the tenth cohort of Praxis Fellows during the 2020-2021 academic year. 

This year’s Praxis team members know one another as faces on computer screens, kind WhatsApp messages, and pings on Slack. We know one another’s pets and we’ve seen inside one another’s homes, but we haven’t met one another in person. This is because, like many UVA students and faculty, we have met remotely on Zoom during the 2020-2021 academic year. For this reason, we’ve been intentional about building community among ourselves and outlining how we want to work together. Our charter is a reflection of our commitments to integrity, community, equity, and play. [Project Title], similarly, grew out of these commitments, [as well as…]

[Project Title] is inspired by the digital teaching and learning practices that became necessary after the University of Virginia announced that it would be moving all classes online on March 11, 2020. It grew and changed based on conversations we began having as a group in September 2020 relating to our relationships with pedagogy, preconceptions about in-person and online learning, and what it might mean to change curricula to address questions of labor, accessibility, and equity. We watched Dr. Roopika Risam’s lecture on abolitionist digital pedagogy, reviewed curricula and syllabi from our institution and others, and sought out other digital projects 

Our project website makes ample use of the handwriting and illustrations of praxis fellows: 

This is Grace’s handwriting.
This is Emma’s handwriting.
This is Elise’s handwriting.
This is Crystal’s handwriting.
This is Savanna’s handwriting. 
And this is Aaron’s handwriting.

We wanted the project to feel handcrafted, because it is – [Project Title] is shaped by the hands, intentions, experiences, and biases of its makers. 

Project Goals

The goals of [Project Title] are to:
Create empathy-driven community
Compel action and decision-making 
Remind each visitor to this site of our interconnectedness

[Project Title] also benefited greatly from the input of:

Mackenzie Brooks, Washington and Lee

Dave (lastname?), RE: Grants - to Dave, we are sorry that we introduced one another to you. This process of introduction led us to gush about one another, and probably made you uncomfortable. 

Brandon Butler, for teaching us about intellectual property (in an actually fun and approachable way).

Lauren Work for teaching us about project sustainability (and how to enable closed captioning while presenting using Google Slides)!

The Scholars’ Lab 
[I stole this description from Unclosure – I’m sure we can add and change words, but I also want to credit those authors]

The Scholars’ Lab was established in 2006 by the University of Virginia Library as a site for innovation in the humanities and social sciences. The Scholars' Lab is a place where faculty and students can explore digital resources, find expert help, and collaborate on innovative research projects. The SLab also hosts events such as workshops, talks, and roundtables, and sponsors the Praxis Program and the Digital Humanities Fellows Program.

The Praxis Program 
[I stole this description from Unclosure – I’m sure we can add and change words, but I also want to credit those authors]

Each year, the Scholars’ Lab funds a cohort of doctoral students from across the Graduate School of Arts & Sciences to serve as Praxis Fellows for the academic year. During the fall semester, fellows receive training in digital methods and tools as well as in collaborative project management. During the spring semester, fellows conceive, design, build, and publish a digital project. This year, the Scholars’ Lab charged the Praxis Fellows with creating a project focused on digital pedagogy.
