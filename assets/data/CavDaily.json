As recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, healthcare workers are first priority in receiving the vaccine. They are followed by elderly residents of nursing homes and care facilities \u2014 and, finally, to the general populace by each state\u2019s discretion. The Commonwealth of Virginia has received 1,232,350 doses of the Pfizer vaccine. Here in Charlottesville, distribution to healthcare workers, some essential workers and those above the age of 75 has already commenced. While this process is carried out \u2014 bringing hope to the nation as a whole \u2014 minority groups who have been disproportionately affected by this pandemic continue to face the repercussions of COVID-19. This includes the exacerbation of existing disparities in healthcare coverage and the increased risk of contact with the virus. This is especially true for the Latinx community \u2014 the largest growing minority group in the United States and here in Virginia. With the existing racial equity data in Virginia, we see that Latinx and Black people constitute one-third of healthcare workers but 17 percent of COVID-19 vaccinations compared to 71 percent of their white counterparts. Addressing these disparities is dire, especially if the vaccine does not become readily available until early summer.', 'Systemic racism is a public health issue \u2014 when it comes to healthcare coverage, minority communities often fall through the cracks. Nationally and locally, the Latinx community has been disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. In central Virginia, Latinx people account for 7 percent of the population, but 25 percent of COVID-19 cases. This is likely the result of several factors. The Latinx community is often faced with barriers to affordable and accessible healthcare including the social determinants of health which the CDC has outlined. These include having access to quality education and economic stability. Moreover, the ability to work from home is a privilege that is not afforded to 83.8 percent of the Latinx community in the U.S. This includes the overwhelmingly high percentage of Latinx essential workers.\\xa0', 'People of Latinx identity are also three times more likely to contract COVID-19 and four times more likely to be hospitalized by COVID-19 than their white counterparts. The Latinx community and the Native American community are the least insured racial groups in the nation, at 27 percent and 30 percent uninsured respectively. The Latinx community often exhibits higher rates of pre-existing health conditions which can increase the severity of COVID-19 symptoms. Finally, one study found only 34 percent of Latinx people trust vaccine safety. The statistics are overwhelming\u2014 as a society, we must contend with our nation\u2019s long history of medical racism that has caused this mistrust in the medical system.\\xa0', 'We must commit to protecting and ensuring quality of life, not just for the wealthy, and not just for certain racial groups. Likewise, the medical community must work to undo the history of systemic racism and begin or continue to reconcile with minority communities, especially when it pertains to vaccination. The American Medical Association identified 13 contributing factors to racial inequality in medicine, including anti-immigration policies and rhetoric which directly affects the Latinx community. Medical professionals can more widely expand on their approach to care and treatment as some have begun to do, dismantling the strictly Eurocentric approach to medicine. Finally, they must recognize that minority communities can benefit from a culturally sensitive approach to healthcare which can help build much needed trust.\\xa0', 'Healthcare must likewise be approached from multiple facets, including working to decrease food insecurity and increase access to affordable housing. The AMA lists strategies to help combat these disparities for healthcare professionals and communities at large. One solution includes increasing or expanding on access to public health programs for the Latinx community in a culturally relevant fashion. In regards to the COVID-19 pandemic, there are short-term solutions, including providing free testing to minority communities. Further, minority communities hit hardest by the pandemic should follow frontline workers, the elderly and essential workers in access to the vaccine. To combat mistrust regarding the vaccine, minority communities should be allowed to partake in discussion and share their concerns. Finally, Health Affairs Journal proposes the CDC create and track demographic data on vaccine distribution to ensure equity in vaccine distribution despite racial or economic differences. Currently, Virginia is lagging in collecting demographic data on COVID-19 vaccinations.', 'As we enter the last few months before a widely distributed vaccine becomes available, we must pay special attention and care to underserved minority communities. In preventing a future pandemic, we must recognize that healthcare in this country is not created equal, nor is it equally distributed. Nationally, the government must commit to increasing accessibility to healthcare for communities who may not otherwise have access to these resources. Locally, there are methods to help bridge the gap in accessible healthcare between the Latinx community with others. This includes strengthening partnerships with and investing in organizations that serve the Latinx community and know their direct needs.\\xa0', 'The Charlottesville community must rally behind local organizations like Sin Barreras and UVA Latino Health Initiative who have committed themselves to improving the lives of those in the Latinx community. However, funds are often tight. We can better support the Latinx community on any level. This includes through funding. However, in a time of great financial stress following the holidays or the overall economic conditions, supporting the community can look different. Volunteer for these organizations, or even educate your family on the racial disparity in this country. Likewise, the University can help build trust with minority communities like the Latinx community by helping to provide further resources for these organizations. While Virginia places further COVID-19 restrictions, it is ultimately our own actions which have the potential to hurt or to better the lives of others.', 'Yssis Cano-Santiago is an Opinion Columnist for The Cavalier Daily.

While the prospect of newly introduced vaccines has left many hopeful that the end is near, the country is still seeing daily new cases consistently exceeding 100,000. The Blue Ridge Health District \u2014 which covers over 250,000 people across Charlottesville, Albemarle County and other surrounding counties \u2014 reported a peak in new daily cases as recent as Jan. 4 of this year. The Centers for Disease Control predicts that a new strain of the virus \u2014 one with higher transmission rates \u2014 will become the dominant strain of COVID-19 by March. This is particularly worrisome here at U.Va. as students live in close proximity with one another both in dorms and off-Grounds housing, where we know disease has the potential to spread even faster.', 'Last semester, just over 50 percent of students who responded to The Cavalier Daily\u2019s survey said they self-isolated when returning to Charlottesville. In addition, only 66 percent of students who were possibly exposed to COVID-19 responded that they followed the CDC\u2019s recommended quarantine period every time. This suggests many students lack empathy for the Charlottesville community.\\xa0', \"This semester, with a tighter margin for error, we cannot grow complacent. We all began last fall with greater awareness of the pandemic's impacts, coming off a summer where it was constantly in the news. Still, the University struggled to adjust, with high student cases at the beginning of the semester in particular. As we watch the country grow restless, we must remember the impact our presence has in the Charlottesville community.\\xa0\", 'While the University has not canceled all in-person classes, they have amped up testing requirements and further restricted gathering limits, which gives us hope that the administration is better prepared to address COVID-19 in the upcoming semester. Nevertheless, it is important that students returning to Grounds still recognize the dangerous impact their reckless behavior can have on the surrounding Charlottesville area. Students may feel rightfully frustrated about the lack of actual enforcement and guidance from the University on these policies. However, administrative enforcement should be the last resort when it comes to meeting COVID-19 restrictions \u2014 we must hold each other accountable in our personal circles first and foremost.', 'Furthermore, we must acknowledge the fact that the COVID-19 pandemic \u2014 both nationwide and in the University and Charlottesville community \u2014 has more dire consequences for members of marginalized communities. In particular, Black people are disproportionately impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, highlighting a much broader issue related to the disparities in healthcare access. Despite making up 13.2 percent of COVID-19 cases in the health district, Black residents account for 32 percent of the hospitalizations, and nearly 22 percent of the deaths. Further, older populations are at a much higher risk when it comes to contracting the virus \u2014 while those in the 20-29 age group make up the largest portion of COVID-19 cases in the community, it is the older population that has been affected the most by hospitalizations and deaths. When students behave irresponsibly, they must recognize that they are directly putting members of these communities at an even heightened risk \u2014 this includes classmates, peers, University faculty and staff and members of the greater Charlottesville community.\\xa0', 'The onus, however, does not fully rest on the students \u2014 the University\u2019s administration has a responsibility to not only keep its students safe, but to also do all that they can to keep the Charlottesville community safe. As such, the University must work to expand its existing testing options for community members so that those in the surrounding communities that are affected by students returning to Grounds are better able to remain safe and informed. Currently, community testing in Charlottesville through the University\u2019s partnership with the BRHD occurs on three days throughout the week, with two of those days lasting two hours or less. In addition, rain has caused the cancellation of these community testing events in the past, further limiting the accessibility of the testing options. As such, community members are still left without easy access to testing from the University\u2019s health system.\\xa0', \"Students returning to Grounds for the spring semester must remember to act responsibly to ensure a limited spread of the virus. Students are being tested once a week, with quarantine housing provided to those who test positive.

Before I delve into next semester and the policy changes that the University should enact, I want to recognize an important achievement for University students \u2014 long story short, we survived. Let us take a moment to breathe and temporarily discard an academic environment that has us believe we must be on the grind every night and day. I\u2019m proud of us. We pulled through \u2014 maybe not unscathed \u2014 but alive. We must now ensure the University meets our needs as we enter another difficult semester.', 'Provost Liz Magill recently announced a continuation of the fall grading policy \u2014 one which gave us the option to take our courses with the standard letter grade or credit\/no credit\/universal credit. While I\u2019m thankful that the University extended some kind of helping hand, this grading policy does not fully consider students who have been disadvantaged due to the coronavirus pandemic. Rather, it creates the illusion of fairness through a policy that provides more grading options to students \u2014 only to reveal why those very options still inhibit students taking them.\\xa0', 'In her email to students, Magill attached a page of advising principles. Two words stand out in this list of principles \u2014 \u201cholistic\u201d and \u201ctrend.\u201d This webpage notes a \u201cnational trend\u201d across law, medical and business postgrad programs toward viewing applications with a \u201cholistic approach\u201d \u2014 while still recommending students take letter grades in certain required classes. However, that supposedly holistic approach is not set in stone. After all, \u201ctrend\u201d is not all-encompassing \u2014 and letter grades are still being encouraged as more impressive. Encouraging students seeking certain postgraduate opportunities to take letter grades in their classes is evidence enough that we need some sort of equalizer.', 'While we can\u2019t characterize the student body under any universal description, we can assume there are many students on Grounds living with a great deal of privilege during this pandemic. Privilege includes having a healthy and safe environment to return home to or quarantine in. It includes not having financial anxieties because of the pandemic. It includes having stable mental health and solid support systems. It also includes not being a victim of the racism, transphobia, ableism and other forms of discrimination that this pandemic has intensified.', 'Disparities of privilege necessitate a universal credit\/no credit grading policy for the sole fact that some students will be better suited to receive letter grades. I suggest this not on the basis of higher intellect \u2014 though academia\u2019s incredibly meritocratic environment would have us think we can accomplish anything if we try hard enough \u2014 but rather to these higher levels of privilege. Again, while this isn\u2019t a catch-all truth, students not experiencing anxieties over money, domestic turmoil, health or prejudice \u2014 to name a few \u2014 have fewer stressors.\\xa0', 'Thus, the University is wrong to continue the fall grading policy. I\u2019ve seen in my circles of close friends the stress of having to decide between grading options, particularly when the deadline to do so occurs before students can even guess their grade. Students have protested this policy before, starting back when the University implemented a similar policy earlier this spring.', 'At this point, it feels as though our administration is side-stepping student demands and letting students swept up in its meritocracy enjoy the privilege that comes with their A next to another student\u2019s Credit. In reality, no employer or postgraduate program can know the context of what either student is truly going through right now. A universal credit\/no credit policy wouldn\u2019t place us all on an even playing field, but it would recognize that players are no less valuable just because they received Credit. While some students may utilize this semester to boost their GPA, they must recognize that their GPA should not be valued at the sacrifice of fellow students.', 'This upcoming semester will be the most unpredictable of all three semesters we\u2019ve moved through during the coronavirus pandemic. With COVID-19 vaccines administered across the country, I worry that some students will feel safe to be reckless before the country has recovered. While I think we all share the desire for a return to normalcy, we must wait until this vaccine has worked its way through most of the country before we can reemerge from the confines of quarantine \u2014 which may not be in the near future as the country steadily approaches 400,000 deaths from coronavirus.', 'Regardless, I \u2014 alongside so many University students \u2014 am sick and tired of learning beneath an umbrella of administrators who rarely prioritize our needs.

However, in order to encourage increased acceptance of the vaccine, we must respond to the many nuanced concerns by respectfully sharing facts.\\xa0', 'Foremost, I aim to counter a popular myth. This vaccine was able to be produced so quickly for several reasons \u2014 none of which jeopardize its safety. While most vaccines suffer from a lack of funding, the coronavirus vaccine did not. Massive funding provided by the U.S. government prevented financial stallings. In addition, academics and scientists prioritized their work on the vaccine. Hospitals and labs sped up the paperwork process \u2014 filing daily rather than waiting weeks to process the paperwork in batches. Scientists at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration worked seven days a week in order to hasten decision-making. The speed of the vaccine\u2019s production does not risk the health of Americans. \\xa0', 'There are many other protections in place. For one, the vaccine process was extensively scrutinized. Data and Safety Monitoring Boards monitored the clinical trials, and the FDA submitted data to independent advisory committees who agreed that the vaccine was safe and effective. To address some additional worries \u2014 there is no evidence the vaccine will make recipients ill, an ingredients list is available for those with allergic reaction concerns and some coronavirus vaccines are even expected to be vegetarian or vegan-friendly. As additional people begin to receive the vaccine, the U.S. vaccine safety system will ensure continued American health. The coronavirus vaccine is safe.', 'The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shared a plan for distributing the vaccine that most states will likely follow. Frontline medical workers and nursing home residents have been some of the first to receive the vaccine. Those in the general public \u2014 not a part of any priority group \u2014 probably shouldn\u2019t expect a vaccine until May or June. Consequently, there is still a considerable wait before many of us will have to make a decision to accept the vaccine. But if one is available to you, remember the extensive production processes that were undertaken to ensure your safety.', 'Widespread public acceptance of the vaccine will be necessary for any return to normalcy. Indeed, many of the popularized fears are baseless. But enforcing mandatory vaccination would be inappropriate. In order to negate vaccine-related fears and increase voluntary vaccinations, we must respond to concerns by disseminating facts about the safety of the vaccine\u2019s developmental process.\\xa0', 'That being said, historic medical mistreatment of certain populations may contribute to outstanding fears. Mistrust of the medical system by people who have been traditionally mistreated in medical situations is reasonable and must be respected.\\xa0', 'For example, although Black Americans were disproportionately affected by the coronavirus, only 42 percent of Black Americans report that they would accept a vaccine if it were available today. This statistic should be compared to the over 60 percent of white and Hispanic adults who say they would. There is a dense history of medical racism in the United States. Doctors experimented on enslaved Black people, sometimes even without anesthesia. Despite available treatment options, the Tuskegee Institute took advantage of poor Black men over the course of decades to study the effects of untreated syphilis. Further, studies show that medical trainees and residents perceive Black patients to be less susceptible to pain than white patients. Accordingly, Black patients have higher mortality rates than their white counterparts. Black Americans are abused by the medical system.\\xa0', 'As a second example, America has encouraged forced or coerced sterilization to limit supposed undesirable populations, including immigrants, people of color, poor people, unmarried mothers, the disabled and the mentally ill. In North Carolina, sterilization surgeries were forced onto those labeled sexually promiscuous or perceived to be unintelligent in the mid to late 1900s. As recent as 2010, California prisons authorized coerced sterilization of female inmates. Even last year, the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement was accused of sterilizing immigrant detainees who did not understand what procedure they were undergoing.\\xa0', \"Time after time, American medical institutions have mistreated minority communities \u2014 do not dismiss anxieties from these communities about the safety of the vaccine. We cannot disregard their trauma. In response to those who express worries, we must provide factual information, like the FDA\u2019s data on vaccine trials. Refer them to answers to frequently asked questions, highlighting that the vaccine is safe and necessary if we want to return to normal. However, for those from minority communities that express their justified concerns, our foremost responsibility is to acknowledge their lived experiences. We should listen and provide facts, but we must also step back and respect the decisions of those around us who have fears of our country's historically racist medical institutions.\", 'Jessica Moore is an Opinion Columnist for The Cavalier Daily.

Researchers are investigating the effectiveness of the drug in reducing an inflammatory response by the immune system in response to COVID-19.', 'Dr. William Petri, chief of the University\u2019s Division of Infectious Diseases and International Health, explained that the main problem with COVID-19 infections is that there appears to be an unsynchronized and hyperactive immune response which leads to excessive inflammation, which can be harmful to some patients.\\xa0', \"\u201cWe've actually seen that in patients at [the] U.Va. hospital \u2026 a specific kind of an immune response made by a cytokine \u2014\\xa0or an immune signaling molecule called interleukin-13 \u2014\\xa0leads to respiratory failure,\u201d Petri said.\\xa0\", 'Overproduction of cytokines \u2014\\xa0small proteins secreted by the immune system that regulate immunity and inflammation \u2014\\xa0can lead to \u201ccytokine storms,\u201d a severe immune response that releases a large number of cytokines in reaction to a disease or infection too quickly. When this occurs, the body begins to attack its own cells rather than using its resources to fight off the invading virus. These cytokine storms are believed to occur in severe COVID-19 cases.\\xa0', 'Last year, University neuroscientists Alban Gaultier and Dorian Rosen discovered that Fluvoxamine reduces the production of cytokines during research into the drug\u2019s effects on sepsis \u2014 a life threatening complication of infection and inflammation in which the immune system spirals out of control. Fluvoxamine is an antidepressant drug that is typically used to treat Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder. Based on this discovery, a team at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis launched a clinical trial in May to study the drug\u2019s ability to prevent the overproduction of cytokines in COVID-19 patients.', 'The 15-day clinical trial was conducted with 152 adult participants who had a COVID-19 infection but were healthy enough not to require hospitalization. In comparing Fluvoxamine with a placebo, researchers found that of the 80 participants that received Fluvoxamine, none of them became seriously ill during the trial. Of the patients that received the placebo, six patients became seriously ill \u2014\\xa0four of those six patients were hospitalized.', 'The researchers acknowledge that the trial had some drawbacks. Firstly, it was conducted on a small number of participants, which limits the insights that can be drawn from it, as the sample size is not large enough to be representative of the overall population, preventing findings from being extrapolated. Additionally, 20 percent of participants \u2014 around 30 people \u2014 stopped answering surveys during the trial. The Washington University team was able to determine that none of those participants were hospitalized or required visits to the emergency department, but they couldn\u2019t be sure that the participants did not receive treatment elsewhere.', \"The team has also noted that recent research has questioned cytokines' role in COVID-19 deaths.

Densmore points to four critical components of the application apart from grades that the application committee will be looking at for admission into the University\u2019s School of Medicine\\xa0\u2014 MCAT score, clinical experience, research and volunteering. Therefore, premed students should not only be concerned about grades during this pandemic and should realize that there are other activities they can pursue to help make their application stronger.\\xa0', 'Another point of stress for premed students was making a decision about the credit\/general credit\/no credit option by the Nov. 6 deadline due to the fact that some students were unsure of their grades in some classes.', \"\u201cThere's a lot of tests that are left, not including finals,\u201d Pasumarthy said. \u201cIt's really not enough time. I think they should have extended at least like one to two more weeks, so people can start calculating their grades.\u201d\", 'Pasumarthy does say that some of her professors have been good at keeping students informed about their performance in the class through either sending an estimated calculated overall grade or updating individual grades on Collab for assignments. However, other professors have not updated her with grades because of factors such as curving, which makes it difficult to gauge performance in those classes.\\xa0', 'Stombres also agrees that the deadline was too early as not all classes had enough assignments or grades in to help a student assess what grading option to choose\\xa0', '\u201cThis year I even had a class that changed professors halfway through the semester who had very different teaching [and] testing styles.\u201d Stombres said. \u201cThis was even a problem for me without COVID. The add\/drop date had passed before I even got my first grade on my first assignment in a class.\u201d', 'The pandemic environment, in addition to the credit\/general credit\/no credit option, has increased the importance of performance feedback in classes to ensure that students have enough information to make an informed decision about the grading opportunity.\\xa0', 'The grade in a class is what ultimately guides the decision-making process. \\xa0Kittlesen recommended that students with grades in the A and B range should not opt for the credit\/general credit\/no credit option.', \"\u201cIf I see on a student's transcript, credit, I am probably going to be thinking that that student was like the C range on their performance,\u201d Kittlesen said. \\xa0\u201cI'm not likely to think that that student was in the A range or even \u2026 the B range.\u201d\", 'Pasumarthy used the same decision making process in choosing to opt for letter grades for all her classes on her transcript, but she does mention that it was difficult in finding resources in aiding with this decision making process.', '\u201cI think there was not enough information put out on why maybe you should take credit\/ no credit,\u201d Pasumarthy said.\\xa0', 'She believes that it would\u2019ve been helpful if the University had provided more resources for helping premed students, which would\u2019ve helped relieve some of the stress premed students encountered when having to make this decision.', 'Stombres however had a different perspective on the stress related to choosing a grading option.\\xa0', '\u201cWas I stressed?\u201d Stombres said. \u201cYes. About this decision making process? No, not really. It wasn\u2019t a decision for me.

Both vaccines are based on the spike protein, also known as the S protein. The spike protein is what is used by the SARS-CoV-2 virus to enter cells in the human body. Both vaccines instruct cells to form a harmless piece of the spike protein, which allows the immune system to recognize a foreign protein and create an immune response. The building of this response results in the body\u2019s new knowledge of how to protect against future infection.\\xa0', \"The COVID-19 vaccines are not only characterized by their high efficacy \u2014 with Pfizer showing an efficacy rate of 95 percent and Moderna with a rate of 94.1 percent \u2014 but also by the time it took to produce both vaccines.

Hospital, the Pfizer vaccine was exclusively used due to its earlier arrival time, though the Moderna vaccine was delivered as of the morning of Dec. 23.\\xa0', 'Since the Pfizer vaccine requires ultra cold freezing temperatures ranging from -70 degrees Celsius to -80 degrees Celsius, it has been shipped in larger quantities compared to the Moderna vaccine.', \"\u201cOur current plan is to use the Pfizer vaccine until it's exhausted and then to switch over to the Moderna vaccine,\u201d Sifri said.\", 'The switchover to the Moderna vaccine occurred in the week of Dec. 28.', 'Of the University Health System workers that have received the vaccine thus far, no serious side effects have been reported, though local pain and discomfort have been a common symptom. Other reported symptoms during the observation period after vaccine administration included two people with nausea and one person with lightheadedness.\\xa0', 'Sifri also described the excitement felt by the University Health community in response to the vaccine.', '\u201cI think we\u2019ve been just incredibly gratified and excited about this opportunity to provide vaccines for our team members, and they\u2019re certainly responding with their excitement as well,\u201d Sifri said.\\xa0', 'This excitement was echoed by Mesha Jones, a nurse within the University Health System who works on the wound care team as well as the critical care team and recently received the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine.

Prior to the pandemic, the majority of people had never experienced this form of long-term social isolation.', 'However, there is a portion of the population that has lived in isolation long before coronavirus was even on the world\u2019s radar. This subset is the chronically ill \u2014 individuals homebound due to physical limitations, chronic fatigue syndrome, immunodeficiency or other health barriers. \\xa0The now universal experience of social isolation can provide a greater sense of empathy for the chronically ill who spend months, years or even a lifetime apart from others.\\xa0', \"Emily Deaton, a disability advocate and writer for Women's Health Interactive, has personal experience with long-term medical conditions. In contrast to the shared experience of pandemic isolation, Deaton notes that chronic illness isolation is very different because she faces limitations that her able-bodied peers do not. For example, while her friends could balance an academic and social life in college, Deaton often had to prioritize one over the other because she lacked the energy for both. This meant carefully scheduling social outings and unfortunately staying home when her symptoms flared up.\", \"\u201cI didn't feel very understood because most of my friends \u2014 or pretty much all of my friends \u2014 in college were able bodied, so they didn't really have similar experiences,\u201d Deaton said.\", 'Another key distinction between the forms of isolation is the perception of progress. While 2020 has come with canceled plans and delayed career goals, at least most people are being similarly impacted. On the other hand, staying home due to medical struggles often entails postponed personal goals while others are moving forward in life and reaching milestones.\\xa0', 'Third-year College student Michelle Whitlock was forced to take a year-long medical leave in November her first semester at the University. Whitlock was disappointed because her college journey was sidetracked just as it began, and she was forced to watch others experience this exciting time without her.\\xa0', '\u201cTo see my friends work towards their academic and career goals while I was recovering from a concussion and in chronic pain \u2026 to be honest, I felt like a failure,\u201d Whitlock said.\\xa0', 'Furthermore, Barbara Zunder, director of the Student Disability Access Center, noted that one of the major distinctions between the two types of isolation is the longevity of solitude for chronic illness patients.', '\u201cThe biggest thing that we have to remember is that for the majority of the global community, this pandemic is going to end,\u201d Zunder said. \u201cFor people with disabilities that require them to isolate, they will continue to maintain this lifestyle.\u201d', 'For those without chronic illnesses, the realization that isolation will ultimately come to a close is relieving. However, those with chronic illnesses who must remain in isolation will likely be left behind in the post-pandemic world.\\xa0', 'There are a few main reasons why the chronic illness community is not always visible or at the forefront of our minds, according to Zunder.', 'First, the chronically ill may not be able to go out as frequently as their peers due to flares of pain, fatigue or other symptoms. If a chronic illness patient has to repeatedly turn down offers to spend time with others due to their illness, they may receive fewer and fewer invitations in the future, as their friends stop asking in anticipation of another rejection, Zunder said. This constant feeling of being forgotten adds to the mental burden for someone living an isolated life.\\xa0', 'Second, not all chronic illnesses are discernable at first glance. There are a host of chronic illnesses that wreak havoc internally without visual symptoms apparent to an onlooker. The term coined for those who visually appear well but are actually suffering underneath is \u201cinvisible illness.\u201d\\xa0', 'For example, someone may observe a cast and be able to conceptualize the experience of pain from a broken bone. However, that same person could view someone who is seemingly able-bodied and struggle to grasp the hidden pain of living with an \u201cinvisible\u201d chronic illness. Deaton shared that she noticed an interesting shift in how people perceived her illness when she started utilizing a mobility aid.', \"\u201cPeople would more readily offer their seat to me [on a bus] when I had a cane versus when I didn't, even though the only thing that changed was me using a mobility aid, and my conditions were still the same,\u201d Deaton said.\\xa0\", 'Furthermore, when envisioning someone who is chronically ill, the tendency may be to paint a mental picture of a bedbound elderly person, not someone in the prime of life. Zunder explained how this misperception is often due to the fact that young people are generally viewed as healthy, and therefore many adolescents with chronic illnesses face an additional level of stigma.', '\u201cA young person with a chronic illness has an added layer of complexity in that the youth are generally viewed as young, healthy, and able-bodied,\u201d Zunder said.\\xa0', 'For all of these reasons, the chronically ill can be left behind in isolation or even unnoticed at times, which is dangerous because they are the ones people should be intentionally checking in on to offer their support. Additionally, there is significant research that suggests isolation takes a toll on one\u2019s body, both physically and mentally. According to the CDC, studies indicate a connection between social isolation and an increased risk for major health problems, such as heart disease, dementia and strokes.', 'Psychology Prof. Dr. Joseph Allen came to a similar conclusion with his own research. Allen has decades of experience studying the social behavior of adolescents with his role as the principal investigator of the Kliff-Vida project. The study follows a sample of 184 students from a local middle school beginning at age 13 into adulthood. Allen said that a major finding of the study is that the lack of strong social relationships early on is an indicator of mental and physical health problems later in life.', '\u201cIn short, the social interactions that young adolescents and young adults have look like they\u2019re crucial for both physical and mental health over the course of a lifespan,\u201d Allen said.\\xa0', 'He explained that humans store mental and emotional trauma in the body. There are also signs that we physically begin to deteriorate on a biological level when we are kept separate from one another.', 'Despite the grim statistics, the isolation of the chronically ill has created one superpower within the population \u2014 resilience. Both Allen and Zunder agree that the chronically ill are experts at living the pandemic lifestyle of social isolation.', '\u201cThey have come to terms with things the rest of us \u2026 are still just grappling with,\u201d Allen said.\\xa0', 'However, Allen was quick to note that it is not human nature to ever fully adapt to isolation.\\xa0', '\u201cIt\u2019s not something we ever fully adjust to,\u201d Allen said. \u201cWe\u2019re not wired to be separate from one another.\u201d', 'While all of this information may be disconcerting, society has the power to fight isolation fatigue with one simple habit. According to Zunder, making an intentional effort to connect with those who are still alone can make a lasting difference in the lives of those living with chronic illnesses. Prioritizing social time with others, even virtually, can promote mental well-being. Right now, it may be easier to reach out for a virtual movie night or family video call because most are still in a form of isolation at the same time. However, a true testament to one\u2019s dedication to maintaining social connections is how one responds when their life resumes.\\xa0', '\u201cThe way that we are currently checking in on each other during this time needs to be continued for people who must remain in isolation,\u201d Zunder said.', 'Deaton also recommended that friends and family of the chronically ill take the time to listen and learn about medical conditions. She noted that in the past, when someone has taken the time to learn about her chronic illnesses, it made her feel cared for and supported.\\xa0', \"\u201cEspecially because it impacts my life in such a huge way every single day, that [learning about my conditions] told me that that person really cared about me,\u201d Deaton said. \u201cI think that's something that can really make someone feel less alone.\u201d\"]","18":"['While adjusting to a pandemic-altered semester, students have learned how to develop personal plans for safely socializing and going about daily life.

If his active site is already occupied, [dexamethasone and albumin] cannot bind together.\u201d', 'Minor and the team of researchers demonstrated for the first time how dexamethasone binds with serum albumin for transport. Their new research indicates that other drugs and the hormone testosterone may compete with dexamethasone for the limited sites on serum albumin, resulting in drug displacement. In drug displacement, a drug administered at a high concentration can displace another drug, like dexamethasone, at the binding site, limiting its potential effectiveness. The scientists found that the testosterone molecule binds to albumin in the same way that dexamethasone does, further suggesting a competition between the two.\\xa0', 'Those with diabetes have been found to have more severe symptoms of and complications with COVID-19.

This winter is particularly invigorating as millions of college students return home, communities continue to navigate the ever-changing landscape of a global pandemic and the nation recovers from the effects of a momentous presidential election. Indeed, this winter is undoubtedly a time of change. However, at least one thing remains constant \u2014 the persistent and increasing threat of COVID-19. As such, it is imperative that students recognize this threat \u2014 and the role they play in mitigating its effects \u2014 as we transition to life at home this winter.', 'To many students, it may seem as though the restrictions of the past eight months are finally subsiding. With recent COVID-19 vaccine trials yielding promising results and the momentary peril of dormwide lockdowns drifting further into the past, it is easy to imagine that the University has effectively curbed the spread of COVID-19. This mindset is only reinforced by the implementation of asymptomatic prevalence testing which, though certainly beneficial, may provide a false sense of security for students on Grounds who assume that their peers have tested negative for COVID-19. Even beyond these tangible suggestions of progress, however, is the fact that many Americans are simply tired of following COVID-19 restrictions. After eight months of masks, takeout boxes and classes on Zoom, many people \u2014 particularly college students \u2014 have had enough.\\xa0', 'As our attitudes have changed, so too has the progression of COVID-19 \u2014 but only for the worse. As of Thursday, nationwide reports of new daily COVID-19 cases totalled more than 221,000, far surpassing the daily totals of late spring and early summer. Even more troubling, however, are recent death rates, which have reached totals of more than 3,100 per day in the United States. In response, governors nationwide have issued a plethora of orders tightening existing mask-wearing mandates, closing restaurants and schools and limiting in-person gatherings \u2014 Governor Ralph Northam included. In the University community, the average positive case rates rose steadily throughout early November \u2014 a rise made even more concerning by the fact that thousands of on-Grounds students have recently returned home for the holiday season.', 'Obviously, the pandemic is far from ending, although the attitudes of University students seem to suggest otherwise. As disclosed in a Nov. 15 email from Dean of Students Allen Groves, a number of off-Grounds gatherings occurred throughout Halloween weekend, with large numbers of students openly violating COVID-19 guidelines. Such occurrences are not an anomaly, however, with student attitudes toward COVID-19 growing more lenient as the semester progressed. Indeed, as students, we have grown accustomed to the frenzy of contact tracing, regular testing and the occasional positive case. Desensitized to the uncertainty of life in a pandemic, many students have convinced themselves that the worst of COVID-19 is over, instead choosing to live the college semester they once imagined. In doing so, however, they simultaneously fail to recognize the risk they pose to University students, faculty, staff and contracted workers \u2014 a risk that increases exponentially as many students travel home for the winter.', 'Beyond our own attitudes, however, are many situational factors that make the spread of COVID-19 even more formidable in the coming months. Unlike last spring and summer, we can no longer gather outdoors to evade viral transmission and, for many of us, have much larger networks than we did at the beginning of the pandemic. Even if we test negative for COVID-19 before traveling home for the winter, such a test only represents a single moment in time, a moment that quickly ends when we return to dorms, dining halls, restaurants and airports. Among those of us who have tested positive in the past, long-term immunity is not guaranteed and cannot be relied upon. Compounding this situation, widespread dissemination of a vaccine may still be months away and, until then, we must avoid the temptation to gather with family and friends.\\xa0', 'Thus, it is imperative that we change our behavior before placing more communities at risk. The holiday season is a time of great celebration but, this winter, it must also be a time of great vigilance. As college students, we have a unique responsibility to protect our friends, families and communities this winter, regardless of how our attitudes on Grounds have changed this fall. Indeed, this holiday season, we must collectively check our COVID-19 complacency. This will translate to a holiday season that is far from ordinary \u2014 a holiday season defined in large part by continued mask-wearing, a lack of large gatherings and the absence of all nonessential travel.

After spending the past decade desperately trying to fend off competition in the form of streaming and home theater setups, the pandemic has renewed claims that the theater industry is dead or dying. The postponement of almost every major studio release until 2021 has essentially made this a lost year for Hollywood. With Regal Cinemas closing all of its locations and considering bankruptcy due to its reliance on so-called \u201ctentpole\u201d movies, the future of the theater business seems far from encouraging. Representatives from the Alamo Drafthouse Cinema and the Violet Crown shared their perspectives on what the present circumstances mean for theaters and theatergoers in Charlottesville and throughout the country.', 'Scott Flanagan, the Vice President of Operations for Cojeaux Cinemas \u2014 which operates Alamo\u2019s Charlottesville location \u2014 was concerned that many in the Charlottesville area are unaware that the Alamo Drafthouse is open for business and are fearful of the risk inherent in attending the theater. Charlottesville\u2019s other two movie theaters, Violet Crown and Regal, have remained closed since the early days of the pandemic, but Flanagan believed \u201c[movie theaters are] actually safer than the grocery store.\u201d Particularly given the popularity of Alamo\u2019s new personal theater rental option \u2014 which allows customers to share a theater with only their trusted friends for $300 plus the price of tickets (food and beverage charges are included)\\xa0\u2014 Flanagan believed that his theater was doing a fine job of minimizing risks and was frustrated that audiences remain wary of theaters given the lack of outbreaks traced back to them. While it is true that no outbreaks have been traced back to theaters \u2014 and public health officials have applauded the use of personal theater rentals to combat the coronavirus\\xa0\u2014 officials are skeptical of regular theater usage and actually ranked theaters significantly more dangerous than grocery stores.', 'Flanagan also commented on the pandemic\u2019s impact on studios. Because nearly every blockbuster movie that was slated for release in 2020 has been pushed back a year, he predicted 2021 \u201cwill be the year of the blockbuster.\u201d Unlike most years, when studios release tentpole movies two or three weeks apart, the sheer number of major movies due for release in 2021 means they will have no option but to release them in close competition. According to Flanagan, \u201ctentpoles and blockbusters are usually spread out so they don\u2019t cannibalize each other, one every three or four weeks \u2014 but you\u2019ll see more that are every other week.\u201d While this may not be welcome news for the studios, movie theaters could have a field day, especially if public opinion changes on the relative safety of seeing movies in theaters.\\xa0', 'Cameron Polson, the general manager of Charlottesville\u2019s Violet Crown, also shared his experience during the pandemic. The Violet Crown is still closed, which has led the theater to lay off all of its employees, which Polson called \u201cthe most obvious thing we\u2019ve struggled with.\u201d However, the Violet Crown does intend to open back up in the same space, taking advantage of features like a similar theater rental program to the one currently being run by Alamo Drafthouse. \u201cI think a lot of movie theaters are seeing that\u2019s the safest way to do it \u2014 control how many people are going to be in public spaces at once,\u201d Polson said. He added that closing the theaters had given Violet Crown the opportunity to invest in safety protocols such as adding ionizers to the HVAC units and investing in electrostatic sprayers \u2014 \u201cwe\u2019re actively working on new protocols that allow us to offer the safest environment possible.\u201d', 'While the future is uncertain for the Violet Crown, Polson recognized that its status as a home for arthouse and independent films could help it weather the storm of upheaval currently being caused by both the coronavirus and digital streaming services. He pointed out that movies such as \u201cThe Irishman\u201d were already being released directly on Netflix, and the pandemic had only expanded the field of competition for leading films such as that one \u2014 although there is evidence to suggest that Netflix is losing money by not giving their big-budget movies significant theatrical releases, which may change things in the future. However, because the Violet Crown has \u201calways made a big effort to get great arthouse and independent movies on the screen,\u201d the current movement of blockbuster releases toward direct-to-streaming will likely \u201cgive [Violet Crown] more opportunity to fill out [its] programming with a great selection of somewhat unheard of films,\u201d according to Polson.\\xa0', 'While both Flanagan and Polson were understandably disappointed with the theater industry\u2019s lack of success in the past year, they were equally optimistic about the future of moviegoing. Their evidence for consistent demand for watching movies in theaters was anecdotal, but it suggested an undeniable truth \u2014 although home theaters are improving and becoming more accessible with the advent of 4K and cheap widescreen televisions, there is no replacement for the experience of being in a theater. Particularly for comedy and horror movies, which rely on a shared lack of knowledge in the audience about what will happen next, the experience of watching a first-run movie at home pales in comparison to viewing it in the theater, with others. This has been a brutal year for the movie industry, but there are still glimmers of hope \u2014 both for those in the industry, and for those who simply love movies.\\xa0']","35":"['Many January term courses at the University offer a new look at everyday topics.

For those who display symptoms or have been identified as a close contact of someone who tested positive for COVID-19, there will be a separate testing process available, Rosner said.', 'Although Rosner said that it would be \u201ctoo early\u201d to say anything about a possible delay of spring semester given the circumstances of rising cases right now, Magill said that the University aims to have more in-person classes in the spring semester and that the outdoor tents will be up and heated during the colder months.', 'After the fall, Magill said that she knows of no known transmissions of the virus in the classroom and has faith in the University\u2019s ability to increase testing for students and faculty who will be interacting with each other on Grounds. However, each of the schools are still in the process of determining their own modes of instruction, she said.', \"\u201cIt's been an unprecedented time on Grounds in Charlottesville and in the country,\u201d Magill said. \u201cI think all of us have been struck by the resilience, the creativity and the sense of community among our faculty, our staff and our students \u2026 We've come together as one university in new and very innovative ways. I'm grateful to the entire extended community for everything they've done this semester.\u201d\"]","39":"['As the fall semester winds down, professors across departments agreed that it has been a challenging few months for faculty as well as students.', 'This fall, Prof. Michael Wormington taught cell biology \u2014 a required course for biology majors \u2014\\xa0online. Wormington, who has taught at the University since 1993, said that this semester was one of the hardest he has ever experienced. He said that he doesn\u2019t think his challenges have been that different from students given that professors have to deal with similar situations, such as being isolated from other faculty members and using online platforms for classes.', 'Given that Wormington\u2019s class this semester had almost 400 students, he said it has been especially difficult to get to know his students even though the class was synchronous.\\xa0', \"\u201cI'd say the largest difference and the one that I have struggled with the most is the inability to be able to interact with our students in person,\u201d Wormington said. \u201cWe've realized how much we miss, and we need that interpersonal interaction with our students and that more than anything has really been the biggest loss.\u201d\", 'In an effort to bridge the gap between himself and students, Wormington set up coffee chats during which students could meet a half hour before class. Through these coffee chats, Wormington said he got to know a great group of students while discussing class and sometimes even engaging in political discussions.\\xa0', 'While Spanish Prof. Francisco Valverde did not teach a large lecture class this semester, he said that teaching his online synchronous Spanish poetry classes of around 25 students also presented challenges. Valverde said he believes that we have all become fearful and vulnerable of our weaknesses during these times of COVID-19, and for that reason, he tried to make poetry an instrument for relieving the anxiety and fear of his students.', '\u201cI believe that one of the most fundamental aspects of life is to care for others,\u201d Valverde said in an email to The Cavalier Daily. \u201cThat builds us up and rebuilds us. Poetry is also a form of caring.\u201d', 'Similarly, Asst. Politics Prof. Rachel Potter taught a mid-size politics class of around 30 students and said that this semester has been a \u201csurreal experience\u201d for her. In an email to The Cavalier Daily, Potter said that she misses getting to know her students and the \u201cserendipity of in-person exchanges,\u201d both of which are difficult to recreate in the online classroom setting.', 'Potter also highlighted how difficult it has been to pick up on when students are stuck or not understanding the material while on Zoom.', '\u201cTeaching is more challenging in the online format,\u201d Potter said. \u201cUsually, when I teach, I look out into the classroom to gauge students\u2019 reactions. Did they understand? Are they confused or frustrated? It\u2019s much harder to get that feedback from a little square of a student\u2019s video online \u2014 especially if their camera is not on.\u201d', 'Assoc. Mathematics Prof. Jim Rolf, the course coordinator for Survey of Calculus II, taught an online discussion section of around 30 students. He also said that this semester has been quite difficult in terms of creating course material, training the other five instructors and ensuring that students have a good learning experience.\\xa0', 'Rolf said that it has been especially difficult to teach math online given that it is harder to help students when they have questions because they are forced to use digital assets such as software to watch videos, read the textbook and take quizzes. In person, Rolf said it is much easier for him to serve as a resource, given that he can walk around the class and help individual students or use the chalkboard to clarify problems.', 'Overall, Rolf said that even though the transition to online learning has been difficult, his students have not given up.', \"\u201cI think it's been challenging for everybody \u2014\\xa0it's challenging for the students, it's challenging for the faculty,\u201d Rolf said. \u201cI feel like my students have a decent attitude about things.

Similarly, Wormington said that he has begun to notice the dwindling number of participants in his class as the semester closes. In order to combat this same Zoom fatigue next semester, Potter says that she will encourage students to take their laptop outside given that as the spring semester closes in May, Charlottesville spring will be in full bloom.', 'Wormington said that he hopes that next semester people will be moving towards getting vaccinated for COVID-19 \u2014 if a vaccine is available by then \u2014 and that group immunity will begin to take over.', \"\u201cWe are still going to have to take precautions, we're still going to have to wear masks and that's just how it's going to be,\u201d Wormington said. \u201cBut I do think people are becoming a little bit more creative about how we can try and incorporate in-person [classes].\u201d\", 'While Valverde said that he believes that online teaching has been an excellent recourse in an emergency situation, he also believes that teaching in person is much more rewarding. Ultimately, Valverde thinks that students already spend so much time looking at screens, and the addition of online classes may increase their sense of loneliness.', '\u201cOur students spend too much time looking at the screens of their cell phones or their computers to the point of losing contact with reality,\u201d Valverde said. \u201cTechnology is useful but it can increase our sense of solitude.

This notable lecture marked this semester\u2019s last weekly forum for the Medical Center Hour \u2014 which is put on by U.Va.\u2019s Center for Health Humanities and Ethics. Fauci, who is also a member of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, touched on six main topics regarding the virus \u2014 epidemiology, virology, transmission, clinical manifestations, therapeutics and vaccines.', 'In his first point of discussion, epidemiology, Fauci noted that this is not a completely novel virus \u2014 referring to SARS-CoV from 2002 and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome from 2012, which were coronavirus strands that infected over 8,000 and 2,500 people across the globe, respectively. Despite phylogenetic familiarities with other coronaviruses \u2014 meaning the virus have similarities in evolutionary development \u2014 Fauci also notes that COVID-19 is the worst viral outbreak that the world has seen since the Spanish Flu in 1918, which resulted in the death of at least 50 million globally, including 675,000 people in the U.S.\\xa0', '\u201cAs of [Tuesday], there were 56 million cases and over 1.3 million deaths globally,\u201d Fauci said. \u201cUnfortunately for us in the United States, we are the country that was hit the hardest \u2026 with more than 11 million cases and now over 245,000 deaths.\u201d', 'Reflecting back on the response of the United States, Fauci drew comparisons to the European Union. Due to a premature reopening of the economy, the U.S. was never able to reach a baseline of cases as was seen in the European Union. Through a variety of graphs, viewers could see a drastic minimization of workplace presence in Europe during the early months of the pandemic in addition to far less park, grocery and pharmacy store visits. The data indicated that parks and outdoor spaces in Italy and Spain decreased by 50 percent between March and April, while the U.S. only saw a 20 percent decrease. Around the same time, workplaces in the two European countries saw a 70 percent decrease, while the U.S. shut down by about 50 percent.', '\u201cI testified before the Congress a couple of months ago when we were at 40,000 [cases], and said that if we did not do something different and contain this \u2026 we would get to 100,000 cases a day,\u201d Fauci said. \u201cI was severely criticized by some members of the Congress for being hyperbolic.\u201d', 'But as case numbers have continued to rise, Fauci\u2019s prediction came true \u2014 since Nov. 8, the U.S. has registered over 100,000 new cases per day, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s COVID-19 tracker. Now with a record-breaking number of cases\\xa0\u2014\\xa0nearly 11.5 million cases \u2014 Fauci says the U.S. is in the process of a resurgence in cases as we head into the winter months.\\xa0', 'Following these comparisons, Fauci moved on to discuss the transmission of the virus, which has led to the world-wide practices of mask wearing and social distancing. The six-foot distance, Fauci says, comes from the fact that respiratory droplets can spread six feet during conversations. Despite those initial findings, recent research has shown the aerosol nature of a portion of droplets, which can remain suspended in air for a long period of time and therefore pose a greater threat to virus spread.', \"\u201cRight now, today \u2026 we're finding that innocent occurrences such as groups of friends and family meeting indoors because of the cold weather \u2026 [are] becoming a major source of asymptomatic spread to the group,\u201d Fauci said.\", 'Heading into the holidays, Fauci says it is up to families to make individual decisions that will protect their most vulnerable relatives and friends. The University is sending students home after the end of in-person classes Tuesday for an extended winter break \u2014 currently set to last until February. To help limit potential spread upon students\u2019 return home, the University is providing testing to all students living in Charlottesville and Albemarle County prior to their departures. But students will have to remain vigilant once they arrive at home.', 'When it comes to preventing acquisition and transmission, the fundamentals are five-fold \u2014\\xa0 covering the nose and mouth, maintaining physical distances, avoiding congregated areas, being outdoors rather than indoors and frequent hand washing.', 'As much of the world knows at this point in the pandemic\u2019s course, the severity of cases range anywhere from asymptomatic cases to death. This viral characteristic is one that not even Fauci has experienced.', \"\u201cI've never seen anything like it,\u201d Fauci said. \u201cThat is just so unprecedented to see a virus that can kill you and can cause severe morbidity and mortality, and yet so many people have absolutely no symptoms at all.\u201d\", 'For those that overcome the virus \u2014 even those just with minimal symptoms\\xa0\u2014 Fauci noted that around 25 percent experience the persistence of symptoms, meaning they still experience bothersome effects for weeks or months following clearance from the virus, meaning a person can no longer transmit the virus to someone else. These symptoms often include fatigue, shortness of breath, temperature dysregulation and brain fog.', 'Now eight months after the U.S.\u2019s national state of emergency declaration, there have been two drugs recommended by the National Institutes of Health for the treatment of COVID-19 \u2014 remdesivir and dexamethasone. Of the two, only remdesivir has received U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval. The most recent treatment that was given emergency-use authorization by the FDA Nov. 9 is monoclonal antibodies \u2014 antibodies produced from a clone of SARS-CoV-2 cell line consisting of identical antibody molecules. However, Fauci questions the long-term effectiveness of monoclonal antibodies.', '\u201cWhat is going to shake out, I can assure you, is that \u2026 monoclonal antibodies will obviously be good early on in the course of disease, and much less effective as we go later into the cause of disease,\u201d Fauci said.', 'In regards to vaccines, those with major investments can be split into three platforms \u2014\\xa0nucleic acids, viral vectors and protein subunits.\\xa0', 'Bioentech Pfizer and Moderna, in collaboration with the NIH vaccine research center, are utilizing the nucleic acid platform, called mRNA. In this platform, cells are \u2018instructed\u2019 to create proteins to fight and prevent disease.\\xa0', 'In the viral vector platform, companies are mimicking a natural SARS-CoV-2 infection in hopes that the body will produce a strong immune response. This platform is being utilized by the pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca \u2014 which is partnering from the University of Oxford \u2014 and the Johnson & Johnson subsidiary Jannsen and Merck.\\xa0', 'Finally, Novavax and Sanofi are utilizing the protein subunit platform to produce antigen molecules from microbes.', 'According to Fauci, five of these vaccines are in phase three trials, and results are in for Pfizer and Moderna. On Tuesday, Pfizer announced their trial had 95 percent efficacy, or effectiveness, and Monday, Moderna announced a 94.5 percent efficacy. Now that a high efficacy has been met, the trial data must be reviewed by the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee before they can receive an Emergency Use Authorization by the FDA. Even with severe cases, Fauci says both trials showed a very clear difference in severe COVID-19 cases between the vaccine versus placebo groups. Specifically, Moderna saw zero severe cases in their treatment group and 11 in the placebo group.', '\u201c[Nucleic acid] was a new platform, which clearly has shown a very striking efficacy signal almost identical in two separate studies done by two separate companies,\u201d Fauci said.', 'Once a vaccine is out, the next step is the breakdown and triage of vaccine distribution. Though the current breakdown announced by the National Academy of Medicine is not set \u2014 the final decision will ultimately be made by the CDC \u2014 high-risk healthcare workers, first responders and old age groups are slated to come first. Following this will be those in critical risk, including people in essential industries such as teachers.', 'Additionally, society will see another dilemma following vaccine distribution \u2014 community uptake. According to a recent poll, only 50 percent of Americans plan to get the vaccine due to skepticisms over quick manufacturing and a lack of confidence in the long-term safety of the vaccine.\\xa0', '\u201cThis is something that we must address by outreach in the community, by individuals that the community actually trusts,\u201d Fauci said. \u201cWe would not want to have an efficacious vaccine, that at the population level is not effective because of a lack of uptake.\u201d', 'Fauci also mentions that society must not let their guard down once a vaccine is distributed, as it will take a long time for the population to reach herd immunity, which he estimates requires more than a 75 to 80 percent vaccinated population.', 'After the presentation portion of the talk, Fauci fielded questions from the audience, which were moderated by Marcia Day Childress from U.Va.\u2019s Center for Health Humanities and Ethics. When asked how to convince people to get the vaccine, Fauci says that in terms of skepticism due to the rushed nature of its creation, people need to understand that the speed is due to extraordinary technology, enormous investments and independence and transparency of the decisions by groups like the Data and Safety Monitoring Board, FDA and the Vaccine and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee.', '\u201cI can tell you, as a colleague of all of us here on this boot, this has been an independent decision,\u201d Fauci said. \u201cIt has been done in the classic way that decisions are made about vaccine safety and efficacy.\u201d\\xa0', 'In the final minutes of his lecture, Fauci took the time to look at the past in order to guide our future, referencing a recent paper he co-published called \u201cEmerging Pandemic Diseases: How We Got to COVID-19.\u201d Fauci notes that there are a variety of factors \u2014 including the encroachment on the environment and human-animal interface \u2014 that have been major contributors to the spread of coronaviruses, as increased interactions between species give these viruses time to mutate then infect humans.\\xa0', \"\u201cThe bottom line \u2026 is similar to something that we wrote years ago \u2014 outbreaks and pandemics have been with us forever, even prior to recorded history,\u201d Fauci said. \u201cThe critical issue is that we cannot prevent the emergence of a new microbe. But what we can do is by our preparedness, prevent that emergence from becoming a pandemic process. And that's going to be the challenge for the future as we learn lessons from the past, and we make sure we don't lose corporate memory of what we're going through right now.\u201d\"]","41":"['University President Jim Ryan, Provost Liz Magill and Chief Operating Officer J.J. Davis joined The Cavalier Daily for a Zoom interview Tuesday to recap the fall semester and discuss the University\u2019s plans ahead of an extended winter break. During the interview, they all agreed they are pleased with how the University fared this semester despite the pandemic.', 'Ahead of the fall semester, Ryan said that some of his administration\u2019s goals were to bring students back and give them as positive of an experience as possible while being safe, as well as to not endanger the Charlottesville community. Under these metrics, Ryan said that he would consider the semester a success.', \"\u201cBack in August and early September, most people were saying it was going to be impossible for us to have students back, to keep them safe and keep classes in person, and that's essentially what's happened,\u201d Ryan said.\\xa0\", 'This semester, approximately 30 percent of University classes were conducted with an in-person component. University administrators have seen no evidence of COVID-19 transmission within these classroom environments.', 'Magill noted that in looking toward the spring semester, increasing the University\u2019s in-person offerings is a major academic priority \u2014 one that has been helped by increased testing capacity and the knowledge that there has been no known classroom transmission. Some ideas for in-person opportunities next semester include encouraging students to form study pods, holding office hours on the Lawn or teaching large lecture classes in a stadium.', '\u201cThe biggest challenge is delivering on the educational mission for students,\u201d Magill said, adding that online classes and socially distanced classrooms with plexiglass shields is a much different experience than students are accustomed to. \u201cThe efforts by students and faculty have been nothing short of heroic.\u201d', 'While Ryan said that there have definitely been \u201cbumps along the road\u201d when it comes to student compliance with the University\u2019s public health guidelines, he said that the vast majority of students have been taking the health and safety guidelines seriously.', 'The University adjusted its approach to bringing students back to Grounds throughout the semester \u2014 first postponing on-Grounds move-in and in-person classes to two weeks after the start of online classes, then relocating hundreds of students\u2019 residential housing assignments to increase quarantine and isolation capacity just before the rescheduled move-in date.', 'Since Aug. 17, the University\u2019s COVID-19 tracker has recorded 1,234 cases of COVID-19 within the University community, of which 1,056 are students. Cases peaked in mid-September \u2014 about a week after the delayed undergraduate move-in date \u2014 with a single-day high of 59 cases reported on Sept. 17, of which 57 were students.', 'Among those 1,056 total student cases, however, Ryan said that no University students have been hospitalized for COVID-19. There currently are 20 COVID-19-related hospitalizations within the U.Va.

Charlottesville and Albemarle reported a combined total of 21 cases Wednesday.', 'Though Ryan said that he hopes students return from winter break with the understanding that it is still important to follow University COVID-19 guidelines, he acknowledged that the longer the pandemic lasts, the harder it will be to maintain compliance.\\xa0', 'He described the possibility that students may sidestep COVID-19 restrictions as the pandemic drags on as \u201ca constant worry.\u201d', '\u201cIn some respects, complying with the health and safety guidelines will be even more important next semester because we\u2019ll all be spending more time inside, which is higher risk,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cEveryone is going to have to come back determined to comply again and comply all the way through.\u201d', 'As COVID-19 cases continue to rise across the country, Magill said that the University administration continues to meet daily with its epidemiology team to discuss the University\u2019s response.

The University plans to conduct post-arrival testing of all students within five to seven days of the start of the semester. Prevalence testing, symptomatic testing and wastewater testing will continue throughout the spring semester.', 'Next semester\u2019s quarantine and isolation capacity may likewise be subject to change. Throughout the fall semester, quarantine and isolation housing occupancy remained below 50 percent capacity, largely due to the volume of quarantine spaces available \u2014 roughly 1,500.\\xa0', 'Along with converting several on-Grounds residences to quarantine and isolation spaces, the University booked several hotels in the Charlottesville area for the duration of the semester.\\xa0', 'Davis said the University is currently evaluating the spring semester\u2019s quarantine offerings.\\xa0', \"\u201cWe'll make sure we have the appropriate number of isolation and quarantine beds to meet the needs of whatever the virus throws at us, but we might do it a bit differently in how we procure the hotels,\u201d Davis said.\", 'Quarantine housing is currently 2 percent occupied, and isolation space sits at 1 percent capacity.\\xa0', '\u201cOne thing that we decided is that it would be better to have too much quarantine and isolation space rather than too little,\u201d Ryan added. \u201cAnd I think that will be our guiding principle next semester as well.\u201d', 'The University leaders praised the efforts of research faculty and staff behind saliva screening measures, who worked to make the testing accessible to the University community.

The COVID-19 dashboard shows the effect of these policies, as the number of cases sharply declined in the weeks that followed. Provost Liz Magill instituted an optional credit\/general credit\/no credit system for the fall semester and quickly extended it to cover January and spring terms. These policies represent the University\u2019s best efforts to adapt to difficult times and support its students. While imperfect, the administration should be given credit where credit is due. However, we should be mindful of keeping the University in check.', 'With the spring semester on the horizon, the University must recognize the ever-growing risks this virus poses. It is not subsiding \u2014 rather, cases continue to rise at record rates.

My biggest worry now is getting coronavirus. And a few days ago, it almost came true.\\xa0', 'One particular Thursday afternoon, I found myself feeling incredibly nauseous. Later that evening, I found myself hunched over my toilet vomiting. As someone who has only vomited a handful of other times in their life, I was concerned to say the least.

I had so many questions about my condition, but the biggest one was do I have COVID-19? After various phone conversations with my parents as well as my roommates, I decided to get tested through the University.

There was no way I could have tested positive, right? Despite this, I couldn\u2019t help but think the worst.

However, I let myself take a break from the very busy schedule I was used to. As unfortunate as the situation was, I was thankful to have just a little bit of time to relax. I might have felt incredibly sick, but at least I did not have to go to classes feeling that way.\\xa0', 'When I was released from the hotel, it felt as if a weight was lifted off of my shoulders. After one mere phone call from my COVID-19 point of contact and a negative test result, I was able to pack up and head back to my apartment. It had only been a little over 24 hours, but it was almost as if I had been waiting for weeks. When I stepped outside, it felt like I had stepped out of my personal prison. I hadn\u2019t realized how suffocated I felt until that moment.\\xa0', 'While I was worried about how I could possibly last two weeks in that hotel room, I was also preoccupied with thoughts of those I had been in contact with prior to my quarantine. As a second year in the School of Nursing, I have two in-person clinical labs that I attend each week. I had attended my last lab hours before my symptoms began and I kept regretting that, even though I had not felt any symptoms at the time. What if I had put my peers at risk?

For some chronically ill and disabled, the online format provides a new level of freedom, as physical barriers to entering a building for work or school dissolve in the online arena.', \"\u201cSo many institutions wouldn't allow for remote work [prior to the pandemic], and for some people with disabilities, it's a huge bonus to be able to work from home, to be able to control your environment [and] to not be impeded by lack of access to buildings,\u201d Cook said.\", 'In contrast, working on a computer poses a physical challenge for some. Rupa Valdez, associate professor in Public Health Sciences & Engineering Systems and Environment, elaborated on specific pandemic challenges from her own personal experience with both disability and chronic illness.\\xa0', 'Valdez noted that staring at a screen all day is harmful for her vision and long-term concussion recovery. Furthermore, the repetitive motion of typing can be detrimental to her body. While Valdez usually works with a typing assistant in her office, since the pandemic started, she has had to adapt to working with an assistant remotely because of social isolation. While Valdez is creative with approaching her work on the computer, the excessive screen time is far from ideal.\\xa0', 'Furthermore, Valdez mentioned the dilemma for those seeking long-term treatments for chronic conditions \u2014 since they are also the ones generally considered \u201chigh-risk\u201d for COVID-19 complications, they are the least likely to venture into doctor\u2019s offices for therapies.\\xa0', \"\u201c[The pandemic] has meant that some of the therapies I engage in, I haven't engaged in for months, which means I\u2019ve had some setbacks or not as much progress as I would like to see in some spaces,\u201d Valdez said.\\xa0\", 'In addition to limiting her own excursions, her family members have also adhered to social distancing guidelines to minimize her exposure to the virus.\\xa0', \"\u201cThere are a lot of kids that are able to play outside [and] interact with their friends, and my daughter isn't able to do that as much because she knows it's just not possible for our family,\u201d Valdez said.\", 'Valdez also noted that while she has been fortunate during the pandemic, many families are confronting financial hardships. In addition to health hardships, acquiring the food and medications necessary to manage a chronic illness is already challenging during a pandemic, but a financial strain exacerbates these difficulties.', 'To offset these additional pandemic challenges for the disabled, Valdez suggests making strides in ensuring that virtual environments are fully accessible.', \"\u201cIn an ideal world, everything is universally accessible, every meeting has closed captions, it's not something that's novel,\u201d Valdez said.\\xa0\", 'If there is one key takeaway, Krentz encourages others to begin with the simple step of checking in on those who are socially isolated. It is not always possible to alleviate the suffering of others, but someone can offer meaningful support simply by lending an ear.\\xa0', '\u201cI think what is the biggest thing people can do is just remember disabled people,\u201d Krentz said. \u201cWe just have to be conscious of all the people who are alone and support each other.\u201d']","63":"['In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, the research done in the University\u2019s Department of Public Health Sciences, and that of other public health departments, is important in providing analyses and guidance to those making policy decisions.

Earlier in the semester, however, James Madison almost ran out of quarantine space \u2014 a contributing factor to the school\u2019s shutdown. After shutting down, the university expanded its quarantine and isolation capacity by renting out space in at least four local hotels.', 'Following a similar rise in cases within the first few weeks of the semester, Virginia Tech also quickly realized that its original 172 quarantine spaces would not be enough to accommodate sick students living on campus. To create more room, the university relocated the 70 residents of East Eggleston Hall and refunded the students 20 percent of their housing to compensate for the inconvenience and moving expenses.', 'The University similarly relocated hundreds of students in order to create more quarantine and isolation housing just two weeks before the delayed move-in of on-Grounds students.

Medical Center. Kadl said she hoped that this expansion will answer some of their remaining questions about how the virus impacts people after they stave off the initial infection.', '\u201cThe thing we really want to look into with the expansion to non-ICU patients is to look at whether the infection by itself, regardless of how severe it was, will have long standing effects on lung health,\u201d Kadl said. \u201cWe know that ICU patients may have long standing issues but we really haven\u2019t focused \u2014 no one has really focused on non-ICU patients.\u201d', 'In the midst of all the unknown surrounding COVID-19, Ramani claimed that his clinic\u2019s patients so far had a different recovery trajectory than those in Europe and thought that it might have been because U.Va.\u2019s COVID-19 ICU had a lower number of patients than hospitals in more densely populated urban areas.', '\u201cOur patient cohort didn\u2019t really have much of the symptoms other than some of the pain issues and ongoing fatigue, as compared with European studies where they noticed they have ongoing cough, stomach issues, and so on and so forth,\u201d Ramani said. \u201cWe were able to focus on our patients better than other places because they did have a lot more patients than us.\u201d', 'As of Wednesday at 1:58 p.m., there were 20 inpatients at U.Va.

According to Bell, influenza and COVID-19 spread in the same way, so protection from one virus also protects from the other. Australia has already seen lower influenza activity this year, and health officials, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, have attributed these lower numbers to increased social distancing, hand washing and mask wearing that has occurred since the start of the pandemic.', '\u201cNow that [America\u2019s] focus has turned to these respiratory illnesses, we have an opportunity to educate the public again about influenza and to make sure people understand that this is also a serious illness,\u201d Bell said.', 'In 2008 and 2009 during the H1N1\\xa0\u2014 or swine flu \u2014 outbreak, there was an increase in the number of people receiving flu vaccinations, and both Bell and Jackson hope to see similar increases in the coming season.', \"\u201cIt may be that people's awareness of COVID leads to greater uptake of the flu vaccine, which I think would be really helpful,\u201d Jackson said.\", 'Each winter, U.Va.

According to Jackson, physicians are not entirely sure that SARS-CoV-2 is going to be seasonally variable, though they must still be prepared for that situation. Jackson also predicts that current testing platforms currently dedicated to seasonal flu tests may also incorporate coronavirus testing in the future.', 'Despite not knowing whether COVID-19 will be a seasonal virus, research has found that the genetic makeup of coronaviruses mutate much slower than the genetic makeup of flu viruses. This would prevent the coronavirus from mutating as quickly as influenza, opening up the possibility of creating a coronavirus vaccine with long-lasting immunity.', '\u201cThen, [a coronavirus vaccine] may not be the sort of thing you would have to get every year,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cYou would expect less chance of the [coronavirus] escaping that vaccine, unlike influenza.\u201d']","85":"['As the University strives to closely monitor COVID-19 cases and accordingly modify plans for controlling the spread, first years living in dorms are being tasked with adapting to protocols which include \u2014\\xa0but are not limited to \u2014\\xa0widespread testing, quarantine and isolation.

This is because COVID-19 can take up to 14 days to show bodily symptoms. Thus, by quarantining during this time period, students can monitor themselves and be ready to take further steps to limit spread if they do indeed experience symptoms.', 'Colosi-Peterson advises students to be prepared for quarantine or isolation by prioritizing packing belongings such as medications, snacks and chargers.

For many stakeholders, college football is essential for their livelihoods. Beyond college football\u2019s financial importance to most athletics departments, the lucrative sport is also a major economic driver for college towns across the country. Charlottesville is no exception.', 'In August, Sports Illustrated estimated the economic impact of Big Ten college football games in cities like Madison, Wis., Lincoln, Neb. and Iowa City, Iowa to range from $12 million to $16 million per home game. While Scott Stadium is smaller and Virginia has a less prominent football program than the venues and schools in these cities, college football still leaves a substantial impression on Charlottesville.', 'Tens of thousands of fans usually flock to Charlottesville each football gameday. In 2019, an average of almost 48,000 people attended Virginia\u2019s seven home football games. But these fans don\u2019t just watch the game while they\u2019re in town \u2014 they also go shopping, dine at restaurants and stay at hotels, providing a substantial boost to the local economy.', 'Amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, Virginia Athletics has restricted attendance at home games to families of student-athletes and coaches, citing health and safety considerations as well as guidelines provided by the Commonwealth of Virginia. Currently, these guidelines restrict attendance for sporting events to less than 50 percent occupancy of the venue or 1,000 patrons.', 'According to Roger Johnson, economic development director for Albemarle County, the loss of football fans \u2014 meaning numerous potential customers \u2014 compounds the pandemic-induced economic recession that has been hurting the local economy for months.\\xa0', 'While Johnson mentioned that unemployment in the region has been gradually improving from its lowest point around 12 percent to around 8 percent now, he admitted that the local economy is still a ways away from pre-pandemic levels when unemployment in the Charlottesville-metropolitan area was at 2.4 percent.\\xa0', \"\u201cYou get the idea that the economy is definitely trending in a favorable trend since the pandemic has hit, but it's nowhere near recovered,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cJust based on [unemployment] numbers alone, you can tell the economy is still struggling.\u201d\", 'Johnson elaborated that the absence of fans from home football games affects various industries in the area including travel, restaurants and lodging. He added that businesses closer in proximity to the football stadium are likely to see the greatest impact.', 'For example, the success of Mincer\u2019s \u2014 a fourth-generation family-owned store that sells University-themed apparel \u2014 is understandably linked to the presence of Virginia football. On days of home football games, Mincer\u2019s location on the Corner is usually filled with shoppers, but the combination of the pandemic and an empty Scott Stadium has made this impossible.', \"\u201cThat Saturday [of a football weekend], for like three or four hours before and then a few hours after [the game], it's just packed in here, the whole time,\u201d said Cal Mincer, vice president of Mincer\u2019s University of Virginia Imprinted Sportswear. \u201cYou can barely move around there's so many people in here. But this year, when you can't go to the stadium and we can only let 10 people in here at a time, it's not like that.\u201d\", 'Mincer estimated that the store saw \u201cless than a quarter of the usual foot traffic\u201d on the day of Virginia\u2019s season-opener against Duke.', \"\u201cWe're hoping for the best, but we were not surprised to see it [being] fewer people than a typical gameday,\u201d Mincer said. \u201cAs the season goes on, it seems like it'll probably be the same \u2026 On our end, we're just trying to keep the doors open and the shelves stocked.\u201d\", 'Beyond Mincer\u2019s, the hospitality industry, including restaurants and hotels, is also set to be hit hard by both the lack of fan attendance at football games and the pandemic more broadly. Roy Van Doorn \u2014 president of the Charlottesville chapter of the Virginia Restaurant, Lodging & Travel Association \u2014 estimates that the local hospitality business is potentially down 20 or 25 percent in a season without fans as compared to a normal season.', 'The pandemic\u2019s impact on Charlottesville restaurants has been clear, and many historic establishments are fighting to stay afloat. Stuart Rifkin, a business partner at the College Inn, said that the restriction on fan attendance is especially challenging for restaurants on the Corner, which is generally a high-traffic area on gamedays.', '\u201cThe lack of football [fans hurt] because those are big weekends for Boylan, big weekends for Trinity, big weekends for everybody on the Corner,\u201d Rifkin said.', 'Rifkin, a 32-year veteran of the restaurant business, described home football games as \u201csix or seven Foxfields a year\u201d and likened them to the Fridays After Five live concert series \u2014 all events that bring big business to the Charlottesville area.\\xa0', 'On the operational side, restaurants have been forced to adapt due to the pandemic. Many \u2014\\xa0including the College Inn, Bodo\u2019s Bagels and Lampo Neapolitan Pizzeria \u2014 have gone outside their comfort zone, closing or modifying their dining rooms and focusing more on the competitive delivery and carry-out businesses. Additionally, Van Doorn elaborated that restaurants are selling less of their most profitable items \u2014 like alcohol, appetizers and desserts \u2014 while incurring more costs related to delivery and carry-out.\\xa0', 'With some restaurants changing their entire business model and paying as much as hundreds of thousands of dollars annually just in fixed costs like rent and loan payments, it\u2019s evident that local restaurants will continue to face financial challenges.', \"\u201cA lot of it boils down to your debt service and your landlord,\u201d Rifkin said. \u201cIt's like that in every business. If you have enough funds to weather the storm, and you have enough gas in your engine to make it over the 20-foot swells, you'll come out okay on the other side.\u201d\", 'Rifkin added that given how some local restaurants have fared during the pandemic, if the College Inn is generating half of its usual sales, they\u2019re doing well.\\xa0', '\u201cI hope that, with caution, we can reopen our economy and hopefully save some of our restaurants because restaurants are one of our big attractions in town,\u201d Van Doorn said. \u201cWithout restaurants, Charlottesville loses one of its important draws as kind of the culinary capital of Virginia.\u201d', 'Similar to restaurants, hotels have also been negatively affected by the pandemic. With less people traveling for business and leisure, hotels across the country have struggled to maintain profitability.', '\u201cConsumer travel is at an all-time low due to the pandemic, and the U.S. hotel industry has been hard hit,\u201d Asst. Commerce Prof. Christi Lockwood said. \u201cAccording to the American Hotel and Lodging Association, almost two-thirds of hotels are operating at or below 50 percent occupancy \u2014 that is, below the threshold at which most hotels can break even and pay debt.\u201d', 'A key metric in hotel performance is revenue per available room, which is calculated by multiplying a hotel\u2019s average rate for a room by its occupancy rate. Locally, RevPAR \u2014 which the Charlottesville Albemarle Convention & Visitors Bureau measures \u2014 has declined due to the lack of fans at athletic events, Johnson explained.\\xa0', 'At the moment, Van Doorn estimates that the Charlottesville lodging industry is doing about half the business it usually does, even when taking into account the six local hotels that have been designated as housing for individuals who either tested positive for COVID-19 or were required to quarantine because of exposure to it. The trend is mainly driven by the loss of large traditional segments like travel, weddings and \u2014\\xa0of course \u2014 fans at major sporting events.', \"\u201cThose [segments] won't return for the most part until COVID is perceived to be either under control or we're in serious recovery,\u201d Van Doorn said. \u201cI don't think that we're going to see any real change until, at the earliest, next March.\u201d\", 'While Van Doorn admits that the impact of sports on the local hospitality sector has diminished due to growth in the winery, brewery and wedding industries, he recognizes the benefits of allowing fans to attend home games and what it would mean to Charlottesville.', \"\u201cThis year, a lot of [events aren\u2019t happening] so if we had a stadium that we could fill up, it would have a big impact,\u201d Van Doorn said. \u201cIf we could have a full stadium now, boy I'll tell you what, it would be a huge shot in the arm for the community.\u201d\", 'Given the current state of the economy, Van Doorn and representatives of the hospitality industry have lobbied Gov. Ralph Northam to increase the acceptable occupancy rate at sports venues like Scott Stadium and Lane Stadium in Blacksburg, Va., both of which can hold upwards of 60,000 people.\\xa0', \"\u201cWe are lobbying for a percentage that is doable within safety [standards],\u201d Van Doorn said. \u201cIf you\u2019ve watched any football games from Florida or Georgia, you'll see how they have filled the stadiums, but they're still spread out. That makes a lot of sense and they've done that for the season, and there's not been any huge spike in numbers.\u201d\", 'As the pandemic continues, the Charlottesville hospitality industry braces for winter. According to Brantley Ussery, director of marketing & public relations at the CACVB, as the weather gets colder in November, the city loses attractions, like autumn foliage, that help it remain an appealing destination in the fall. Ussery explained that, in pre-pandemic times, football weekends could drive traffic to the city even in colder months, but that clearly won\u2019t be the case this year unless regulations change. Van Doorn echoed Ussery, stating that the combination of the approaching winter season, ongoing pandemic and loss of football fans has the entire industry concerned.', 'That being said, regardless of what obstacles they face, the people of Charlottesville seem determined to not go down without a fight. Businesses in town have survived for decades for a reason. But, for many \u2014 as resilient as they may be \u2014 the pandemic might just be too difficult to overcome.', \"\u201cI think we're all pretty hardy people,\u201d Van Doorn said. \u201cThe [hospitality] business is not for the meek, it's a hard business. We're used to challenges. [People are] doing whatever they can to survive until next spring, hoping that, by then, most of this is going to be done. This winter will be hard.

The U.S. State Department cited Presidential Proclamation 10043 \u2014 announced May 29 \u2014 which provided conditions for restricting some Chinese students from entering the country. The proclamation claimed China was using students, mostly those past undergraduate enrollment, to collect sensitive information from the U.S. Some of those students were enrolled at U.Va., according to a document shared by the affected students.', 'On Aug. 28, a U.Va. researcher from China was arrested and charged for accessing information without authorization and stealing trade secrets. The criminal charges were dropped Sept. 20 after investigation revealed the allegedly stolen material was shared information available to the researcher.', 'Since the spread of COVID-19 from Wuhan, China, Asians have been strongly connected to \\xa0the virus in the public sphere.

When she was younger, Kweon didn\u2019t understand that others joking about Asians getting good grades played on Asian stereotypes and even took part as an attempt to fit in with her peers.', '\u201cAs I got older I realized that I was helping in continuing this toxic way of thinking,\u201d she said.', 'The belief that all Asians get good grades falls under the model minority myth, which pushes the idea that Asians and Asian Americans are an obedient, law-abiding population that has achieved success through their inherent talent and hardworking nature. While the myth effectively erases individualism and frames Asian Americans as perpetual outsiders, Lew also notes the detrimental effects on minority ethnicities as a whole.', 'The model minority myth pits Asian Americans against other minorities, he says. For other marginalized races facing systemic inequities, their struggle and the root of their issues are blamed on their lack of ability when held up against the mythologized Asian American.', \"\u201cThey're almost telling these people that are being disadvantaged that they shouldn't be disadvantaged ... and that's unfair,\u201d Lew said.\", 'Lew mentions another common stereotype of emasculating Asian and Asian American men.

They cite Ryan\u2019s May 31 public statement on the Black Lives Matter movement, in which he dissuaded the \u201cviolent protests\u201d incited by the deaths of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor. On June 3, he sent out a follow-up email elaborating on his statement and the University\u2019s commitment to racial equity.', 'Lew says the best thing the University can do to address racial discrimination and inequalities is \u201cto keep these conversations going with student associations and leaders on grounds.\u201d Pointing out the power of student-enacted change, he believes this is a crucial first step to reaching a place that can satisfy everyone.', 'Kweon also says the University could take a more active role in supporting students in their efforts to improve conditions for themselves, such as by providing resources for allies.', 'In her own encounters, Kweon strives to speak up for herself.', \"\u201cA lot of times it will happen afterwards, I\u2019ll be thinking [about] a conversation and think to myself, \u2018Oh, wait, that actually was not okay,\u2019\u201d Kweon said. \u201cBut if I do catch it in the moment I will say, \u2018Okay, that's not something you can really say ... that\u2019s a harmful stereotype.

Then, they would be connected to the system, thus providing seamless integration between a home institution\u2019s service and the ACCORD-COVID platform.\\xa0', \"\u201cFor the researcher, it really hides all this infrastructure, all this back-end stuff going on, and just allows them to focus on the research,\u201d Downs said. \u201cThat\u2019s really what researchers want to do. They just want to get their work done, and they don't want to have to know what's behind the curtain.\u201d\\xa0\", 'Currently, ACCORD is in use at institutions such as George Mason University and the Virginia Tech Carilion School of Medicine.

Health is analyzing wastewater samples from University dorms for the presence of SARS-Cov-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. After positive indicators of the virus were discovered in the wastewater of the first-year residence hall Balz-Dobie and five residents tested positive for the virus, the University announced Wednesday that the dormitory's 188 residents would be tested for COVID-19 to stymie a potential outbreak. This is the first time the University\u2019s wastewater testing program has contributed to dorm-wide testing.\", 'The goal of the wastewater program is to detect early and asymptomatic coronavirus cases. Research has shown that the genetic material of SARS-CoV-2 is shed in the stool of infected individuals and can be detected prior to the appearance of clinical symptoms. According to health officials, this information can help prevent COVID-19 outbreaks. This method is being used to complement other testing methods on Grounds, including randomized testing of students for the virus.', 'For residence halls across Grounds, wastewater samples are being collected every 15 minutes and pooled over a 24-hour period. U.Va. Health then tests the pooled samples to determine if anyone living within a given residence hall may have contracted COVID-19. If the virus is detected in a pooled sample from a residence hall, all residents from that dorm will be tested individually for the virus.', 'Amy Mathers, infectious disease physician and associate director of clinical microbiology, was instrumental in developing novel coronavirus tests in March and is now using her expertise to carry out wastewater testing on Grounds. \\xa0', 'Mathers became interested in pooled wastewater testing after being struck by the amount of resources needed to keep up with demand for individual coronavirus tests.', '\u201cWhen you\u2019re talking about thousands and thousands of tests for surveillance purposes, the manpower it takes to collect specimens is enormous,\u201d Mathers said. \u201cThere were some murmurings [from other universities and scientific literature] that you could detect the COVID RNA signatures in wastewater \u2026 I know how to detect COVID signatures in clinical samples, [and said] \u2018let\u2019s see if it works for wastewater.\u2019\u201d', 'Mathers worked directly with Lisa Colosi-Peterson, associate professor in engineering systems and environment, to bring wastewater testing to fruition on Grounds.

Locations are chosen to test as many students as possible while avoiding testing locations where outside sources can contribute to the waste stream, like public restrooms. The number and exact placement of these testing locations varies on a day-to-day basis to ensure that every dorm\u2019s wastewater is monitored every few days.', 'Once samples are collected, Facilities Management personnel deliver chilled wastewater samples to Mathers and her team, who then test the samples within 10 hours.', 'Zmick highlighted that his team has enjoyed working with other University disciplines to contribute to research and the overall mission of the University.', '\u201cThis is truly a combined U.Va. effort,\u201d Zmick said. \u201cWe have the Health System side, the academic and teaching and research side, we have Facilities, and not only utilities but the part of facilities that helps manage housing \u2026 [Facilities is] out there working in the roads, working in sanitary systems all day every day, so we are in a unique position to help.\u201d', 'Like with any testing method, there are some limitations to wastewater testing for SARS-CoV-2.

As she is struggling to find remote work-study jobs due to the limited options, she wishes the University would provide more remote options for work-study students who are not returning to Grounds, especially as failure to find a work-study job can result in additional financial obligations.', \"\u201cI wish they made more remote jobs for work-study students just because I know not everyone is back on Grounds,\u201d Park said. \u201cEven if they were back on Grounds, they may not feel safe, and I don't think anyone should feel pressured to do something just for the sake of money when they feel unsafe in that environment.\u201d\", 'Additionally, Park was concerned about getting to and from her previous job at the library.

After these first few weeks of classes, I have evenly split my time between both, so here\u2019s my honest evaluation about living and learning in both locations this semester, as well as some tips for online classes.', 'At home, my life was generally easier. Specifically, my life was free from distractions. There was no temptation to text my friends and make plans to hang out on the Lawn or to talk to my roommates about what we\u2019re procrastinating on. Even as I sit in my room writing this column, my mind wanders towards asking a couple of friends to meet for dinner later.\\xa0', 'As a result, online classes seemed easier to attend at home as I rarely had anything to do besides work. This leads me to my first piece of advice \u2014 to improve your focus during Zoom lectures, put your phone out of sight. When I could see my phone even just in the corner of my eye during lectures, thoughts about texting friends or checking social media filled my mind, shifting my attention away from the lecture. I noticed a tremendous improvement in my level of attentiveness during both synchronous and asynchronous lectures when I couldn\u2019t see my phone.\\xa0', 'This also leads me to my next piece of advice \u2014 don\u2019t procrastinate. Online classes and asynchronous lectures make procrastination far too easy. It\u2019s important to resist the temptation of doing nothing so you don\u2019t end up five lectures behind in your history class. In my mind, procrastination is about making a choice of whether or not to work. Everyone procrastinates to some extent, and usually, everyone chooses to eventually work at some point, so stop wasting time and do that statistics homework now instead of 2 a.m. tomorrow night.\\xa0', 'So yes, life in Charlottesville is a little more stimulating, but what about the health risks? Well, one major upside to living at home is that the risk of being exposed to COVID-19 is significantly lower. Having already been through a quarantine while on Grounds, I can definitely say that not being able to leave my room at all \u2014 except to use the bathroom and grab food out of the refrigerator \u2014 was enough to make me wish I was back home. Living at home grants some level of assurance and certainty about not getting sick, removing a degree of anxiety associated with risking exposure and subsequently having to quarantine.\\xa0', 'Another downside to life in Charlottesville is the increase in responsibilities. Having to buy groceries, cook meals and wash dishes are all relative drawbacks to living without your parents. Now, that\u2019s not to say having responsibilities in your life is a bad thing \u2014 in fact, having more responsibility is likely a good thing for personal development. However, the increase in these responsibilities pulls more time away from studying and \u201cfree\u201d time, which is why I\u2019m considering it a disadvantage of living in Charlottesville.\\xa0', 'In an effort to get this free time back, I have started two habits. The first is waking up earlier. You don\u2019t need to take calculus to understand that you can get more time out of your day by simply being awake longer in a 24-hour period. Waking up earlier gives me more time to finish assignments before class and thus have more free time later when I want it.\\xa0', 'The second habit is setting small goals that force me to work more efficiently. For example, I\u2019ll force myself to finish an assignment or a reading before I can eat lunch. By making the completion of homework a requirement for me to eat lunch, I create a strong incentive for myself to get my work done. I know it seems pretty weird, but it works for me and I plan on continuing this habit throughout the semester.', 'Less free time and more responsibilities aside, what are the advantages of living in Charlottesville?

The University estimates that an additional 4,400 students moved into on-Grounds housing, according to the Aug. 28 announcement that solidified fall semester plans.', \"\u201cMost of the challenges occur or have occurred off campus or off Grounds,\u201d Ryan added in the Wednesday interview. \u201c[It] didn't make a lot of sense to not have in-person classes because that's not where the problems are arising.\u201d\", 'When asked how many cases, hospitalizations or deaths would trigger the University to close dorms and end in-person instruction, Ryan said the University does not have a target number, but is rather looking at testing and hospital capacity as well as available space for isolation and quarantine.', 'One factor that fuels his optimism is that the University\u2019s hospitalization rate has remained manageable \u2013 54 people have been treated for COVID-19 at U.Va. Health since Aug. 17.\\xa0', '\u201cEven with the increase in cases over the last couple of weeks, the hospitalization rate has not increased as well, which tells you that those who are getting sick are not getting sufficiently sick to require hospitalization,\u201d Ryan said.', 'In the event of a major outbreak at the University, he added that students would not necessarily be immediately sent home, but rather \u201ctemporary restrictions\u201d would be put in place to ensure students aren\u2019t infecting their home communities \u2014 an attempt to \u201cflatten the curve.\u201d', 'Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, recently urged universities not to send students home after shutting down operations, calling it \u201cthe worst thing you could do.\u201d Ryan agrees with the sentiment.', \"\u201cOnce you've brought all these students back to your campus from all over the country \u2014 in some instances all over the world \u2014 you want to do your very best to keep them on campus,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cBecause if you're sending home students who are infected, then you're just spreading the virus.\u201d\", 'The University\u2019s decision to proceed with in-person classes and on-Grounds housing has faced backlash from prominent Charlottesville figures, with Mayor Nikuyah Walker calling the choice \u201ca recipe for disaster.\u201d Ryan said he has been in contact with both Walker and the Charlottesville Human Rights Commission, which plans to send a letter to the University to voice its concerns with an in-person semester.\\xa0', 'Ryan pointed out that thousands of students have already signed leases for off-Grounds housing, and many would return regardless of whether classes were in-person \u2014 a stance he \u201cget[s] that not everyone will agree with.\u201d', '\u201cI\u2019ve always thought it was an incorrect premise to say we\u2019re making a decision about whether students are going to return,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cStudents are going to return.

Students who live on Grounds and test positive for the virus will be housed in repurposed residence halls \u2014 which currently sit at five percent capacity for quarantine housing and one percent for isolation \u2014 or at hotels the University has contracted.', 'Shortly after the University announced its intention to forge ahead with in-person classes this fall, residents of the International Residential College, Johnson, Malone and Weedon Houses and Shea House were notified that their dormitories would be converted into quarantine and isolation areas. Hundreds of students were forced to relocate and were given just 24 hours to choose a housing reassignment or remain off-Grounds.', 'Although Ryan apologized for the disruption to on-Grounds residents and RAs, he maintained his stance that \u201cit was the right thing to do to make sure that we have sufficient space [for quarantine and isolation].\u201d', 'According to Ryan, the decision to increase the number of rooms available for quarantine was made in light of lessons \u201clearned from looking at other universities.\u201d', '\u201cI was concerned that, and others shared this concern, it wasn\u2019t going to be sufficient if we had a serious surge,\u201d Ryan said, \u201cSo, we looked at places with very low density and decided that we ought to move those students to open up those spaces.\u201d', 'Quarantine housing will also be accessible to students who do not live in University housing as needed, Ryan added.', '\u201cIf someone off Grounds really has no option to safely quarantine or isolate, we will obviously work with students to figure something out,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cWe did not go into this thinking that we should have isolation and quarantine space for every single student whether living off Grounds or on Grounds, but we recognize that if situations arise where someone off Grounds needs our help, we absolutely should be.\u201d', 'To bring students into dorms involves other calculations.', 'Ryan acknowledged that the past week \u2014 marked by the arrival of first-years to on-Grounds dormitories and start of in-person learning \u2014 has come with a learning curve. Video footage of a crowded Observatory Hill dining hall circulated over the weekend, causing some upperclassmen and community members to reiterate concerns with the University\u2019s decision to reopen.', 'In this situation, Ryan noted that the solution was to make sure students knew there are other dining options available and to implement people reminding students in the area of the six-foot social distancing guidelines.', \"\u201cThis is everyone's first time through a pandemic at U.Va., and as much as you can plan, new situations arise, and you have to react,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cAnd the goal is to react quickly enough and to learn from it and to resolve it.\", 'In regards to a list of demands submitted Aug. 28 to Housing and Residence Life by Resident Advisors at the University, Ryan said he is aware of the demands but that the University does not plan to issue a formal response.', '\u201cMy view is that we should make sure that the RAs have what they need to be successful,\u201d Ryan said.', 'In their letter to HRL, the RAs express great concern for their personal safety and also that of their residents and the Charlottesville community. They call upon HRL to treat resident staffers as \u201cfrontline workers\u201d and provide them with the \u201cnecessary resources to fulfill our role and protect ourselves, our residents and the community.\u201d', 'Among their demands are hazard pay as frontline workers and adequate PPE, revised and clearly articulated policing and COVID-19 guidelines, provisions for food security and housing stability and revised financial aid policies for resident staff. \\xa0The RAs anonymously submitted their letter and list of ten demands out of fear of retribution due to a policy that restricts resident staff from speaking to the press.', 'Although Ryan said that HRL and the Office of Student Affairs are \u201cworking with the RAs,\u201d an RA who helped to spearhead the creation of the letter and list of demands told The Cavalier Daily that HRL has yet to explicitly acknowledge the receipt of the RAs\u2019 letter and demands.', 'Ultimately, Ryan said these first weeks give hope that the University community will rise to the occasion.', \"\u201cNot everyone is following all of the protocols, which is to be expected, but I've been really heartened by the degree to which students in particular are taking this seriously,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing like seeing examples at other universities where things have gone awry, to make you realize that it takes everyone doing their very best to give us a chance of succeeding.\u201d\"]","140":"['As coronavirus cases continued to rise and nationwide rates staggered, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced convalescent plasma as an emergency-use authorization treatment for COVID-19 on Aug. 23.

Since May 5 of this year, trials on this method of treatment have already been conducted at the University.\\xa0', \"Assoc.

The hope is that the injected plasma will possess the antibodies needed in order to boost an amplified immune response, fiending off the virus and treating the patient.', '\u201cRemarkably, tens of thousands of people have been treated with convalescent plasma outside of clinical trials in the U.S. and as a consequence, we still do not know if it is of superior benefit to other therapies, and if so, in what specific patient populations,\u201d Heysell said. \u201cThe emergency use authorization by the FDA will make acquiring this important clinical knowledge even harder.\u201d', 'The study also held a specific inclusion criteria for patients, meaning it was not a randomized study in which subjects are randomly placed into separate groups with different treatments in order to measure responses. Instead, for the study, patient enrollment was restricted to those early enough within the course of illness to not be placed in the hospital or ICU setting. \\xa0', '\u201cU.Va. is in the process of determining how to use convalescent plasma in those patients that are not otherwise eligible or that decline our other ongoing clinical trials,\u201d Heysell said.', 'As of mid-August, 32 patients have been enrolled in the study. Patients are continually followed up with, as the study is designed to reduce risk and admittance of COVID-19 ICU patients to 25 percent, when historically, patients who get to that certain level of severity with COVID-19 will obtain admittance into the ICU 50 percent of the time. The data and patient follow-up documentation is under current analyses.', 'Prof. of Medicine Lawrence Lum details the scope of the clinical trials.\\xa0', '\u201cThe study was not powered statistically to do a large trial,\u201d Lum said in an email to The Cavalier Daily. \u201cIt was designed as a single arm phase II clinical trial to determine if there might be a large change in response to convalescent immune plasma infusions and to determine if infusions of plasma would alter patient immune systems.\u201d\\xa0', 'Although not contacted by the FDA directly, the University will still report their findings to peer-reviewed journals and public repositories. The University was originally conducting their trial not through FDA authorization, but instead under the Expanded Access Protocol program, which allows for investigational use of a drug with the intent to diagnose, monitor or treat a specific disease.\\xa0', 'Jeffrey Sturek, assistant professor of medicine who specializes in pulmonary and critical care, says the effectiveness of the study is to be determined, based on the limited analyses the University has.\\xa0', '\u201cAll the evidence so far that has been reported [from the study] really depends on how you interpret the evidence,\u201d Sturek said. \u201cLooking at the aggregate of the evidence from the clinical trials, so far, says that it is probably safe and it may be effective, and if it is effective, it\u2019s probably more effective if you give plasma that has higher counts of antibodies and more neutralizing antibodies for COVID-19.\u201d', 'In the treatment of 29 evaluable patients, results look encouraging, yet final analyses have yet to be determined. To the extent the FDA or other clinical domains of public health will utilize the University\u2019s findings remains unknown.\\xa0', '\u201cThe FDA announcement came after we had finished enrolling our patients, so it did not affect our enrollment,\u201d Lum said. \u201cThe U.Va. research protocol data was not submitted to the FDA for a decision, and the numbers of patients done in our trial, again, are too small to drive approval\/disapproval decisions. In fact, there are no randomized phase II clinical trials that have been shown to be effective at driving an approval decision.\u201d', 'Although the emergency use authorization came after the University study ended, the University continues to amass data and draw conclusions from the relatively small number of patients studied. Final results have yet to be published, but the protocol results show it is not toxic to be treated with convalescent plasma transfusions.', '\u201cThanks to caring, focused, supportive, enthusiastic, dedicated and compassionate leadership, and team effort and spirit \u2026 on the COVID-19 unit, blood bank staff and laboratory staff, this study was conceptualized, submitted for all of the regulatory approvals and completed in 3.5 months,\u201d Lum said.\\xa0']","141":"['As the school year progresses and workloads begin to pile up, students are starting to feel the toll of virtual learning, especially that of Zoom fatigue \u2014 the impediment of information processing due to an overuse of virtual conferencing technology that diminishes non-verbal communication learning.

We also want to help seniors connect with family and friends virtually as they practice social distancing, as well as offer educational tools as they learn to use their devices.\u201d', 'The University team partnered with the Charlottesville Free Clinic and, after three weeks of seeking donations, provided approximately 25 devices to under-insured and uninsured older adults in the Charlottesville community.\\xa0', '\u201cWe first emailed close friends and family asking for old devices and funds, but we have started reaching out to bigger businesses and alumni, too,\u201d Subbanna said. \u201cOverall, people have been fairly receptive when we contact them, and even if they cannot offer us a device, $10 and spreading the word about our work go a long way, too.\u201d', 'Since its inception, TeleHealth Access for Seniors has expanded its operations to 26 states in the U.S, with over 200 college and high school student volunteers collecting nearly 1,000 camera-enabled devices to date.', 'The end-to-end process from accepting donated devices to putting them in the hands of seniors and under-served populations involves several steps.\\xa0', 'Donors first complete a form on TeleHealth Access for Seniors website to notify volunteers of their interest in providing devices. Volunteers confirm the donation and either accept a package with the devices in the mail or pick them up at an agreed upon location. After sanitizing donations in compliance with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines, volunteers then gather the devices and ship or deliver the batch to a designated clinic.', 'However, TeleHealth Access for Seniors\u2019 efforts does not end there.\\xa0', 'Recognizing senior citizens may need help with navigating a new cell phone, tablet or computer, the nonprofit provides printable instructions and virtual technical support on the TeleHealth Access for Seniors website for setting up devices, connecting to wifi, accessing medical records online and using FaceTime, Zoom and Skype for telehealth appointments and calls with relatives.', '\u201cThis has been a great initiative because it is easy to volunteer remotely through different fundraising opportunities and signing up for tech support shifts,\u201d Subbanna said. \u201cWhen the pandemic started, I was at home feeling helpless since I am used to being involved in research and volunteering. TeleHealth Access for Seniors has allowed me to still volunteer and serve the healthcare field, but without going places and possibly exposing people to the virus.\u201d', 'With a resurgence of coronavirus cases and deaths across the U.S., the pandemic continues to influence the everyday patterns of the nation and its people, particularly senior citizens and immunocompromised individuals.\\xa0', 'Many public health experts and local and state officials advocate for stricter social distancing guidelines and preventative measures in their regions, including universal mask mandates and stricter restaurant and bar regulations, as states such as Virginia have implemented. Yet until these measures are implemented and people start to act in a more cautious manner in their everyday lives, Americans in high-risk categories will likely continue to rely on alternative methods of communicating with physicians, family members and friends as they stay isolated.\\xa0', 'As a result, Iyer noted that these realities indicate that the work of TeleHealth Access for Seniors is only beginning, and in the coming months, the need for their services will only increase.', '\u201cAs the main founders of TeleHealth Access for Seniors told us, the pandemic is not going away anytime soon,\u201d Iyer said. \u201cSo we will just keep expanding and recruiting more volunteers in more states, because even a little bit of work \u2014 preventing a now potentially life-threatening trip to the doctor\u2019s office \u2014 can make a difference in the lives of older Americans suffering from chronic conditions.\u201d', 'To give a device, donate or volunteer, visit: https:\/\/www.telehealthforseniors.org\/support-us.']","173":"['Two additional student-athletes have tested positive for COVID-19, bringing the total number of positive test results to four, according to a press release from Virginia Athletics.

Emergency responders should now screen stroke patients for potential concurrent COVID-19 infections \u2014 which has implications for treating the patient and for limiting spread of the virus.', 'Pre-hospital communication between emergency medical service crews and physicians, or mobile telemedicine, has long been a priority for the University Health System.

In cases where patients have the most severe form of stroke, where large blood vessels in the brain are affected, invasive treatment is needed, and transport to a large Comprehensive Stroke Center like the University Hospital is preferred, even if the facility is farther away.', 'Choosing the correct facility to treat a severe stroke patient using telemedicine saves time, which is paramount, Southerland explained.', '\u201cWe know that for every one minute that goes by in a large vessel stroke, you lose about a million neurons, and for about every five minutes that goes by, it equates to about a 15 percent difference in the likelihood of them being independent after you treat them,\u201d Southerland said.', 'Now, COVID-19 has added a layer of complexity to forming an immediate healthcare response when treating strokes, requiring further reliance on telemedicine.', 'One concern is that incoming stroke patients may be COVID-19 positive since research has identified a link between COVID-19 infection and stroke. The new guidelines, written in part by Southerland, warn that if COVID-19 positive, stroke patients may require intensive respiratory care in addition to neurological surveillance, which may impact where a patient is transported, even if a patient is not suffering from the most severe form of stroke.', '\u201cA patient who may have stroke and COVID-19 might get triaged to a larger center where they have more equipment and capability to care for that patient, and [choosing the right hospital initially] reduces the exposure of that patient going in and out of other hospitals when it may not be necessary,\u201d Southerland said.', 'Cutting back on hospital transfers reduces COVID-19 exposure for both patients and surrounding healthcare workers, Southerland explained.', 'Thus, EMS personnel are using free online tools to assess stroke patients for likelihood of concurrent COVID-19 infection. Respiratory symptoms, travel history and the number of COVID-19 cases in a patient\u2019s location should be taken into account, the guidelines suggest.', 'If COVID-19 infection is suspected, EMS is advised to begin addressing a patient\u2019s respiratory needs during transport. Emergency responders are in constant communication with hospitals to choose the appropriate medical facility and alert the facility that an incoming patient may be infected with the novel coronavirus.', 'COVID-19 also has implications for treatment of other medical emergencies, like acute heart issues.

As COVID-19 has spread across the world, nurses have been at the forefront of the pandemic, placing them in a particularly vulnerable situation. As essential figures, nurses are tasked with managing risk, directing care plans and spending the most time with COVID-19 patients, in addition to other responsibilities. Yet, despite this significant role, nurses have often lacked the critical protective equipment needed to work and interact safely with COVID-19 patients. According to a survey conducted in April by the Service Employees International Union, 82 percent of nurse respondents said they did not have enough protective equipment to safely protect themselves and care for patients.

The N95 masks that nurses wear \u2014 which are typically reused every day in hospitals facing PPE shortages \u2014 often leave bruises on their faces, which are just some of the physical marks of the overwork and stress that the pandemic has caused.

In May, that discovery sparked a clinical trial at Washington University in St. Louis to determine if the drug could help treat COVID-19 patients, as reducing inflammation in the body has become a key way to fight the virus.\\xa0', 'Fluvoxamine, also known as Luvox, is most commonly used to treat Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. The drug functions as a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor by increasing levels of serotonin \u2014 a chemical in the brain associated with feelings of well-being and happiness \u2014 in the body. Since 1983, Fluvoxamine has been used by more than ten million patients around the world.\\xa0', 'SSRIs are commonly prescribed because of their safety and tolerability, and many SSRIs, including Fluvoxamine, have been used to treat a variety of other conditions such as migraine headaches, fibromyalgia and anxiety.', 'In their initial experiment, Gaultier and Rosen determined that the drug reduced the production of cytokines \u2014 small proteins secreted by the immune system that regulate immunity and inflammation. The drug also proved effective in reducing damage in the inflammatory response during sepsis \u2014 a life threatening complication of infection in which the immune system spirals out of control \u2014 and protected mice from lethal shock.\\xa0', 'New research has found that many seriously ill coronavirus patients have a large number of cytokines in their blood. These high levels of cytokines likely result from cytokine storms, a severe immune response that releases a large number of cytokines in reaction to a disease or infection. During a cytokine storm, the body begins to attack its own cells rather than use all its resources to fight off the virus.\\xa0', '\u201cThe information we have so far suggests that the second phase of the illness can involve a life-threatening inflammatory reaction \u2014 what we call a cytokine storm,\u201d said Caline Mattar, assistant professor of medicine in the Washington University infectious diseases division, in a press release from Washington University. \u201cWe want to learn whether fluvoxamine might help prevent that second phase of the illness.\u201d\\xa0', 'The trial is being led by Mattar and Washington University psychology professor Eric J.

The treatment takes plasma from a patient previously infected with COVID-19 who has created antibodies to fight off the virus. 28 days after the illness, that plasma is tested to ensure there are antibodies against COVID-19 present, at which point the plasma is administered to currently infected patients in an attempt to mitigate the severity of disease.', 'Despite the extensive progress that has been made, Petri does not expect the University to be one of the first institutions to produce a vaccine.

While this improves access to patient monitoring and specialist care for some, those who cannot afford the technology are left out.\\xa0', 'For telemedicine in general, business is booming. Karen Rheuban, co-founder and director of the University\u2019s Karen S. Rheuban Center for Telehealth, said the sudden expansion of the telemedicine program in the University Health System, as well as sudden changes related to billing and license restrictions, has required an \u201call hands on deck approach.\u201d\\xa0', 'In 2019, the center for telehealth supported slightly more than 20,000 telemedicine visits, but mid-March through mid-May of 2020 it had 44,400 visits. Meanwhile, outpatient visits have dropped by 90 percent. To accomplish such a rapid transformation, the center deployed webcams and other hardware to the clinics, correctional facilities and long-term care facilities that it partners with. The University Health System has spent approximately $2 million to expand telemedicine within the University and for community partners.\\xa0', 'The center also kept abreast of continual changes regarding medical technologies that are federally approved and covered by Medicaid. Rheuban has also taken on a policy advocacy role to ensure that physicians are getting paid for their care and that more patients can access telemedicine. A key part to making that happen includes working with public and commercial insurance policies to expand telemedicine coverage and reimbursement.', 'Before COVID-19, public health insurance had limitations on where a patient could physically be located when receiving care \u2014 called the originating site \u2014 in order for the provider to receive reimbursement for telemedicine services. Except for limited cases, like monitoring stroke and substance abuse disorder patients, care from the home was not covered \u2014 until a few months ago.\\xa0', '\u201cMedicaid in Virginia on March 19 issued new rules, and they said the home was an eligible originating site, and they would also pay for telephone visits,\u201d Rheuban said. \u201cSuddenly, we had solutions that enabled us to ramp up the delivery of care virtually across the Commonwealth.\u201d\\xa0', 'Drew Harris, associate professor in the School of Medicine who specializes in pulmonary health and public health, also believes that telemedicine expands access to health, but less so in rural communities.\\xa0', 'Harris has been working with Stone Mountain Health Services in southwest Virginia, which includes clinics that specialize in black lung, a condition common to coal miners. For over a year, Harris drove monthly to see in-person patients at these clinics. Because of COVID-19, these visits have been transferred to telehealth formats where the patient tunes in from their home or \u2014 if they do not have access to the Internet or a mobile phone signal \u2014 a local clinic.\\xa0', 'Although patients and physicians do have to adjust to the new online dynamic, this expansion allows speciality care to be given to patients from far away, instead of them needing to drive four or more hours to receive care from the University Health System in person.\\xa0', \"\u201cFor the most part, it works pretty well and we are able to bring specialty care to a place that has less access to it,\u201d Harris said. \u201cWhat we're all doing now in telehealth with COVID is largely talking to folks while they're in their homes.\u201d\", 'Within the University Health System itself, telehealth can be useful for treating highly infectious patients, according to Kyle Enfield, associate professor of internal medicine in the School of Medicine. Using a system called iSOCOMS, COVID-positive patients can be isolated in the hospital and consulted via telehealth. That reduces the amount of personal protective equipment needed and allows the patient to speak frequently with physicians and family members via webcam.\\xa0', 'Before the COVID-19 pandemic, the University Health System only had five beds set up with iSOCOMS technology. Today, according to Rheuban, there are over 100 \u2014\\xa0a number reached as a result of the hospital not knowing how many COVID-positive patients would be admitted and wanting to be prepared. The occupancy of those rooms varies based on the number of admitted COVID-19 patients and patients from the emergency department waiting until testing is complete.', \"\u201cNow it becomes all the more imperative with coronavirus, but it also enables the doctor to talk to the patient where they're not in spacesuits,\u201d Rheuban said. \u201cIt also enables other consultants to be virtually brought into the room. That way, we're conserving personal protective equipment. We're having a more humanistic experience for the patient.\u201d\\xa0\", 'Although the post-COVID-19 future is still nebulous, more physicians and patients are becoming comfortable with digital interactions, especially if it saves on travel time and expenses.\\xa0', 'Certain medical procedures will still take place in person, Enfield explained, but he hopes that routine check-ups or conversations with a specialist will take place on telehealth platforms. If those interactions can happen online, then more resources can go toward patients who need to be treated in person.\\xa0', \"\u201cIs it really necessary for a patient in southwestern Virginia to fly to U.Va. if all that they really need is my brain?\u201d he said. \u201cIf we can close the distance between expertise and the patients, then I think that's a place where it's good for us to continue this.\u201d\\xa0\", 'Despite these advantages, there are still challenges. One, Enfield explained, is that not all physical procedures can take place via webcam, such as diagnosing a complex or serious illness or changing a breathing tube.\\xa0', 'According to Harris, another challenge is that the resources available to telehealth are limited to the patient\u2019s physical location. For example, a patient\u2019s local clinic might not have the lab testing availability that a University specialist would recommend for that particular case.\\xa0', 'The major barrier to telehealth that Rheuban, Enfield and Harris all pointed to is limited accessibility of technology in underserved communities. Harris pointed out that some areas near the University \u2014 such as Buckingham County \u2014 have the lowest rates of access to high-speed internet in the nation. While he predicts that more biotechnological products \u2014 like a digital stethoscope \u2014 may be available on the market to consumers and expand accessibility to telehealth, other communities will remain behind.\\xa0', \"\u201cThe biggest challenge is that the most disadvantaged populations that don't have the appropriate bandwidth are not going to benefit from it,\u201d Harris said. \u201cA lot of my patients in Appalachia don't have great cell signal because it's real rural and real mountainous, and most of them can't afford to put in a WiFi signal.\u201d\\xa0\", 'Enfield agreed and said that people who do not own computers, telephones or WiFi have a difficult time participating in the burgeoning telehealth field.\\xa0', \"\u201cYou tell them the only way they can see their doctors is through the system they don't own,\u201d Enfield said. \u201cIt basically forces them out of the healthcare marketplace.\u201d\", 'According to Rheuban, the Federal Communications Commission has programs that the University\u2019s Center for Telehealth taps into to bring broadband to rural providers, including the Connected Care Pilot Program, which can bring broadband into patients\u2019 homes.\\xa0']","193":"['The University currently plans to begin fall semester classes on time and in-person, University President Jim Ryan and his executive leadership team announced in a community-wide email Thursday.

Students and faculty alike also struggle with lack of social interaction that is now necessary to prevent the spread of COVID-19.\\xa0', 'Unlike the undergraduate experience, the activities of medical students vary dramatically from year to year. In their first year, medical students are focused on classroom learning. According to Medical student Joey Michel, many professors recorded their lectures even before the switch to online learning. He said that the curriculum and schedule for first years has remained \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d for the most part, but certain classes \u2014 especially involving dissections \u2014 are particularly challenging online. The biggest change for Michel has been socially.\\xa0', \"\u201cFor me, at least, and for many of my classmates, the switch was not too disrupting,\u201d Michel said. \u201cIt was more like not being able to go to the library and study with people.

However, students whose projects are not easily transferable to remote work have been participating in newly offered workshops on computational methods, meeting with their mentors and lab groups and writing research proposals and papers.\\xa0', 'In addition, the School of Medical usually offers a 10-week internship program for undergraduates around the country interested in the biomedical sciences, which had to be canceled.\\xa0', \"\u201cIt's particularly an opportunity for underrepresented students to get some hands-on research experience, and we unfortunately had to cancel that whole program this summer,\u201d Grant said.\\xa0\", 'Opportunities for medical students to engage in in-lab research has also been canceled for the summer, said both Grant and Michel, which affects students\u2019 future residency applications as well as financial situations.\\xa0', \"\u201cA lot of us want to do research over the summer because it helps us with residency applications in the future,\u201d Michel said. \u201cIt also allows you to get funding so that you're not living without any money over the summer.

The conditions to do this include remaining 6 feet apart, not gathering in groups and staying away from crowded places and mass gatherings.', 'For Costi Sifri, director of hospital epidemiology in the University Health System, and Physics Prof. Lou Bloomfield, the importance of and science behind social distancing go hand in hand.

These groups not only include healthcare workers and first responders, but also people living in congregate settings like long-term care facilities, jails and homeless shelters.', 'According to Sifri, these populations amplify healthcare inequalities that already exist and that by combining social distancing with efforts such as early diagnosis and contact tracing, people can prevent infection within those populations that cannot receive the benefits of social distancing.', \"\u201cThis is a stealth virus,\u201d Bloomfield said. \u201cNature designed this one well to run rampant in the whole world's population.

According to the email, students will be automatically transitioned into the credit\/no credit system. Students will then be given the choice to opt in to receive a regular letter grade prior to the beginning of the final exam period. A few weeks later, the administration announced the addition of a \u201cgeneral credit\u201d option. While the CR\/NC opt-in policy was created in response to \u201cextraordinary challenges\u201d in the midst of the pandemic, the current implementation overlooks its original purpose and only serves to perpetuate underlying inequities among the student body.', 'The transition to online courses is a massive undertaking for the University. However, for students, this upheaval involves the additional stress of adapting to a new and unfamiliar environment away from the University and without its many resources. For some, this simply entails moving into a comfortable living situation. For others, this means months without a reliable source of income, housing or internet access.\\xa0', 'This is particularly true of students residing in more rural areas of Virginia, where reliable broadband access is scarce. For classes that rely primarily on participation through live Zoom discussions, which require a fast internet connection, students connecting from rural areas are automatically placed at a significant disadvantage. Making matters worse, community resources that would normally serve to alleviate these issues, such as libraries, are largely unavailable as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\\xa0', 'It is important to acknowledge that the University is taking steps to achieve equitable solutions, such as providing travel assistance and technology to low-income students. However, these efforts are severely undermined by the University\u2019s decision to offer the option to receive letter grades. It is highly inequitable to offer students who are in a comfortable living situation an opportunity to gain an unfair advantage while leaving behind those who are not in the same position due to geographic or socio-economic factors beyond their control.', 'Moreover, messages from individual schools within the University have made it abundantly clear that courses taken under CR\/NC will not be regarded in the same light as courses taken with a letter grade. For example, the McIntire School of Commerce, which requires an extensive application for undergraduate admission, recently published a blog post that set forth recommendations on which grading system applicants should select. Although the post claims that courses taken under CR\/NC will be \u201cfairly considered,\u201d it also explicitly states \u201cgrades provide more insight than credit\/no credit.\u201d For Commerce applicants who need to use the CR\/NC option for any reason, the decision not to take the course for a letter grade might nonetheless inherently place them at a substantial disadvantage upon review of their application.\\xa0', 'Students are also placed at a disadvantage under the current system in comparison to their peers at comparable academic institutions. For example, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill recently announced that it would allow students until August to decide whether or not to take a class for a letter grade. The University should recognize that final grades can change dramatically during the final exam period, as many courses place a substantial emphasis on the outcome of the final exam. By forcing students to decide their grading preference prior to understanding their true standing in the course, the University is putting its own students at a disadvantage in graduate program admissions and employment opportunities alike. In mandating a CR\/NC system, the University removes the need for students to make this choice entirely, substituting it with a more equitable path forward.\\xa0', 'Still, opponents of a universal CR\/NC system maintain that a CR\/NC system invalidates the hard work of students this past semester and that letter grades may be necessary for prerequisite courses to graduate programs. However, given that every student is now facing a dramatically different set of irreversible circumstances than when the semester began, it would be unjust to allow some students to benefit from letter grades while leaving behind underserved populations. In terms of graduate admissions, by eliminating the option for letter grades, students are unlikely to be penalized if they were not given a choice.', 'As an institution that claims to strive toward the ideal of being both \u201cGreat and Good,\u201d the University must strike a unique balance between excellence and equity.

The University Health System announced Thursday that it will participate in an ongoing clinical trial to determine the efficacy of the drug remdesivir in treating COVID-19.\\xa0', 'Remdesivir was a drug originally created to treat the Ebola and Marburg viruses.

In order to eliminate any biases in the trial, patients are randomly assigned to either the experimental or the control group, and neither the patients nor the physicians know which individuals receive the drug.', '\u201cWhen scary diseases like this pop up, people might have a tendency to toss drugs at it we think might work even if the evidence isn\u2019t solid,\u201d Bell said. \u201cWhat we really need are randomized placebo trials to get an accurate sense of whether or not the drug works, how well it works and balance that with toxicity.\u201d', 'Beyond being randomized and double-blind, the trial has adopted an adaptive format. \\xa0Such trials evolve based on feedback that an independent data and safety monitoring board receives. If, for example, remdesivir improved coronavirus patients\u2019 condition, then clinicians would convert remdesivir to act as the control state. The intervention group would either receive remdevisir and another drug that may provide additional therapeutic benefits or a different medication in clinical trials with coronavirus patients, such as hydroxychloroquine, a treatment for malaria, lupus and arthritis. This experimental design allows clinicians to adjust the study in real-time and to optimize treatment options.', 'University doctors kicked off the trial on the evening of April 1, and just hours later, they enrolled their first patient through the University Health System.

Nevertheless, clinicians remain optimistic that if remdesivir helps check coronavirus, the FDA will accelerate the approval process as they have done for hydroxychloroquine in critical COVID-19 cases, allowing Gilead to market remdesivir and doctors to distribute it.', '\u201cThe FDA has engaged in some emergency approvals lately, and if there is a positive result in this trial, then I think the FDA will move quickly to do the same for remdesivir,\u201d Jackson said.', 'At this point, there is little certainty if a rapid approval process for remdesivir will be necessary. Clinical trials exploring medications and therapeutic procedures spanning the globe are still in full swing, and there is no conclusive evidence yet that remdesivir is the best treatment doctors can offer.', 'Jackson and Bell recognize, though, that the significance of the trial lies not in being the ones to discover the correct treatment for coronavirus. Simply contributing data about the advantages \u2014\\xa0or lack thereof \u2014 for various therapies will help researchers at the University and beyond know where to focus their limited time and resources.', '\u201cThe most important thing right now is to get good data about what works and what is safe, and to do it as quickly as possible,\u201d Jackson said.', 'According to Jackson, whether it is remdesivir, another drug, or a different method of care entirely, the value in their work stems from the progress made towards finding a solution to the pandemic and providing encouragement to people along the way.', '\u201cI am a scientist, so I always want to be careful about making claims about medications, and I won\u2019t be sure until results come back, but I hope remdesivir works,\u201d Bell said. \u201cThe thing people really want and need right now, though, is hope that we can do something to stem the tide of coronavirus.\u201d']","224":"['Researchers at the Biocomplexity Institute received a $10 million \u201cExpeditions in Computing\u201d grant from the National Science Foundation on March 25 to use computational and engineering methods to answer fundamental questions about epidemics and pandemics in real time.

By understanding how to make the most efficient use of the resources at hand, the projections from these models could help policy-makers prepare for and react to future outbreaks. The Biocomplexity Institute has created a dashboard with over 1 million visits daily that contains updated data related to COVID-19 from all over the world. While many of the data sets are publicly available, Vullikanti said that some sets come with restrictions and can therefore not be released to the public.\\xa0', 'The questions that are at the core of the \u201cExpeditions in Computing\u201d grant are complex and interdisciplinary, because epidemics not only play out in bodily disease but political, social and economic changes.\\xa0', \"\u201cEpidemics are not just a health phenomena,\u201d Marathe said. \u201cThat's how people studied it for a long time.

Barrett echoed that the world is only in the beginning stages of this pandemic, and its severity demonstrates the importance of studying these fundamental questions of computational epidemiology.\\xa0', \"\u201cAs bad as this is, it's the early stages and we had better prepare ourselves,\u201d Barrett said. \u201cThis research was proposed \u2026 long before this event occurred, which means there is an awareness that this is important stuff to worry about, think about and do serious work with.\u201d\"]","225":"['The novel coronavirus is a test of humanity\u2019s patience, endurance and immunity as we fight this battle together.

As more COVID-19 cases arise in the United States and Virginia, the University Health System is implementing more and more of its action plan.', 'Chris Holstege, executive director of Student Health, and Costi Sifri, director of hospital epidemiology in the University Health System, are leading the initiative to fight COVID-19.', 'William Petri\\xa0\u2014 medical professor and vice chair for research, who specializes in immunology \u2014 addressed the extent to which the health system has prepared.\\xa0', '\u201cThere are reserved ICU rooms,\u201d Petri said. \u201cWe have made a new COVID-19 screening clinic in the Battle building. We also have additional overflow spaces prepared all throughout the health system.\u201d\\xa0', 'New guidelines have been put in place for the standard hospital and health system operations. All ambulatory clinic visits \u2014 outpatient medical care for routine and specialty consultation, diagnosis, observation and rehabilitation \u2014 between now and April 6 are to be rescheduled for a later date. Urgent care and sick visits will still be held.', \"The University's COVID-19 test currently has a turnaround time of less than 24 hours.\", 'In addition, all hospital visitors must be screened for respiratory symptoms and possible COVID-19 exposure before visiting patients, and patients are limited to two visitors ages 18 and older during their stay at the University hospital. Children under 18 are not allowed as visitors during this time.', 'Despite the planning and guidelines, there are still challenges operating under the pandemic, according to Petri.', 'Tests for COVID-19 must first travel to Richmond for processing before results can be obtained, which can take several days, though the health system hopes to have all testing steps local within the coming days.\\xa0', 'Tracey Hoke, chief of quality and performance improvement in the health system, further clarified the testing status.', '\u201cWe are moving now towards three new platforms that will offer us some in-house testing,\u201d Hoke said. \u201cThe first platform is low [sample volume] \u2014\\xa0one where not too many samples can go in \u2014 so we won\u2019t have a lot of tests with this, but with it, we will soon have options for in-house testing.\u201d\\xa0', 'Cirle Warren, associate professor of medicine in infectious diseases, explained the important testing guidelines that the health system is following in an email to The Cavalier Daily.', 'Those with a fever, cough, difficulty breathing or flu-like symptoms should first call their primary care physicians to see if testing is needed, according to Warren. For now, only individuals in two scenarios are prioritized for testing \u2014 those who have travelled to areas where there is a widespread, ongoing transmission of COVID-19 as defined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, including but not limited to China, South Korea and the United Kingdom,\\xa0and those with severe symptoms that cannot be explained by other viruses.\\xa0', 'Hoke believes the University\u2019s first case of COVID-19, a Maxine Platzer-Lynn Women\u2019s Center employee, was treated through her primary care physician and tested through LabCorp \u2014 a private lab testing company \u2014 as she was not seen or treated by the University Health System.', 'Hoke also confirmed the health system\u2019s preparedness for challenges posed by COVID-19, like complications disrupting trade and travel to Asian countries and school closures creating staffing issues if hospital employees cannot find childcare.\\xa0', '\u201cThis isn\u2019t the first time a pandemic has come around in healthcare, and we have a plan and [a] group in place for caring for patients who need to be hospitalized,\u201d Hoke said. \u201cWe\u2019ve also made plans for the staffing of [the health system] and plans to preserve our protective equipments, which many are made in China and [other Asian countries].\u201d', 'However, for those without severe symptoms, both Petri and Hoke agree that the best plan is perhaps the simplest \u2014 staying home, calling their primary care physician if necessary and practicing social distancing.', 'They encouraged people to follow the CDC\u2019s guidelines, such as those to avoid events with more than 10 people. These practices are especially important because the virus is unusually contagious and often presents with no symptoms for days on end, during which individuals can infect others.', 'Petri traces the virus\u2019s contagiousness to humans\u2019 lack of immunity and calls for social distancing as the only way to slow the pandemic.', \"\u201cWhat\u2019s different about this coronavirus is that people don't have immunity,\u201d Petri said. \u201cIt has jumped from animals into people.\u201d\\xa0\", 'According to Petri, the virus changed when it traveled from a bat into humans \u2014 leading to an entirely different virus for which humans do not possess immunity.\\xa0', \"\u201cIf left unchecked, half the population [of] the U.S. will get infected because we don't have a pre-existing immunity,\u201d Petri said. \u201cThe whole idea is slowing down the epidemic so we don't overwhelm hospitals because we have limited capacity.\u201d\", 'Hoke also emphasized the importance of social distancing to prevent shortages of medical supplies and hospital beds.\\xa0', '\u201cIf patients are not very sick, they should stay at home and call their primary care providers so [as to] not flood the healthcare system,\u201d Hoke said. \u201cThe idea of flattening the curve, or lengthening the time it takes for COVID-19 to reach people in the community, is very important.\u201d', 'The University Health System is consistently monitoring COVID-19 outbreaks in Virginia and the United States. The most recent updates, information, policies and contact numbers can be found on its website. Additionally, the CDC provides COVID-19 information for businesses, employers, schools, childcare and community and faith-based organizations \u2014 as well as information for individuals and families.

Now that classes will be online for the remainder of the semester, professors and students must plan for the rest of the term. For departments like Studio Art and Drama, the change comes with a unique set of challenges.\\xa0', '\u201cThe way I teach is very interpersonal,\u201d said Neal Rock, assistant professor of Studio Art. \u201cIt relies quite heavily on one-to-one mentorship and group participation \u2014 the group is very important, being together is very important.\u201d', 'In Rock\u2019s painting classes, he said he often mixes \u201cpractical, material-based exercises as well as history and conceptual tradition\u201d \u2014 but for a medium like painting, the switch to online learning will present new challenges. Students will now embark on more independent study, along with class readings and written assignments, to work on projects outside of a traditional class setting.\\xa0', '\u201cThere\u2019s issues with regards to access, what materials they have access to and whether they can paint or not,\u201d Rock said. \u201cBut ... they can upload images to Collab or show them on Zoom when they\u2019re doing a conference call.\u201d', 'Both Rock and Bill Bennett, an associate professor in the Studio Art department who teaches sculpture classes, plan to have students pursue projects on their own while checking in and maintaining a group dynamic, particularly in class critique situations. Bennett emphasized the importance of using available resources creatively when he spoke about how his classes will be conducted. Even without access to the industrial machinery available on Grounds, students can still create a space for artistic undertakings.', '\u201cI will be assembling material and tool kits for my entry level students,\u201d Bennett said. \u201cI will be asking them to create their own studio spaces to enable them to create their sculptures. This could be a garage, basement, outside picnic table or corner of a kitchen table.\u201d\\xa0', 'In addition to the difficulty of maintaining normalcy in a studio art context, classes and programs centered around performance have also struggled to adjust to an online sphere. Classes such as Musical Theatre Performance, which relies heavily on live performances and immediate workshopping, require unique ideas about how to preserve the learning environment without face-to-face interaction.\\xa0', '\u201cBecause data transmission latency will prevent me from providing accompaniment to a remote performance, students will be submitting videotaped performances of their songs in advance of our class meeting, where they can accompany themselves, sing to a track, ask a friend to accompany them or simply sing a cappella,\u201d Musical Theatre Lecturer Greg Harris said. \u201cWe will then watch these performances as a group in a Zoom session and offer feedback online in the session.\u201d', 'Harris\u2019s class typically features five to seven live performances from students, which receive immediate feedback from himself and his graduate assistant as well as peer feedback from classmates. Without the ability to provide accompaniment or perform live, the students lose some beneficial aspects of the class.', '\u201cMy musical theatre class isn\u2019t the same done online by sending videos, because we lose all the live aspects of theater that make it spontaneous \u2014 your classmates watching you perform, Greg accompanying on piano to your tempo, instant feedback from your teachers and classmates and utilizing the energy and space of the room in your performance,\u201d second-year College student Karen Zipor said. \u201cOur final was going to be a musical theatre recital but now our final is a written essay, which is just not the same.\u201d', 'Despite these difficulties, Harris also noted room for new opportunities in the online format. In addition to building up skills for a cappella or \u201calternative accompaniment\u201d \u2014 such as karaoke tracks \u2014 performance, Harris said that the digital setting would allow for more exploration of how \u201cthe performances of others can inform your own performance work.\u201d\\xa0', '\u201cWith performances videoed in advance and existing as a Resource on Collab, students will have the ability to watch performances as often as they want, which is not something that otherwise happens in a live classroom performance,\u201d Harris said.\\xa0', 'In classes that require more large-scale performances, some theatre students have not only been required to adjust to an unfamiliar online format, but have also been forced to cancel these long-term projects. The Drama Department\u2019s spring production of \u201cOnce Upon a Mattress,\u201d which was set to open March 26, was cancelled in accordance with the University\u2019s policy regarding COVID-19. For students working on the show for months, the cancellation was a difficult process, especially in consideration of the course credits associated with production.', '\u201c[Associate Professor of Drama Marianne Kubik] said that the cast members would be receiving an email from her any day now about fulfilling requirements for course credit in lieu of performing the play,\u201d second-year College student Micah Rucci said. \u201cWe have yet to be told what exactly that will look like, but I do know that nothing could ever be as fulfilling or as meaningful as the show we were creating. Hard, hard work. Four hours a night, six days a week. Because of COVID-19, we have done all the work for no reward, and don\u2019t get to see the project come to fruition. It\u2019s really a shame.\u201d', 'Amongst a whirlwind of unexpected stress and disappointment, the reality of online classes will soon manifest. Questions about long-term viability and practical considerations abound, but professors and students in artistic fields will still work to create \u2014\\xa0a sentiment which struck Bennett as he was reminded of something he thought about at the beginning of the semester.\\xa0', '\u201cI establish a motto or principle as an overriding theme for the Sculpture classes,\u201d Bennett said. \u201cThe Motto for Spring 2020 was and is E Pluribus Unum. One of many U.S. mottos meaning \u2018Out of Many, One\u2019 \u2026 We are many, and we are now spread out, but look forward to becoming \u2018One\u2019 through the common practice of sculpture, as we enter this new reality.\u201d', 'As arts classes adapt to new class formats, the poignance of becoming one of many is a striking reminder of the creative expression that can happen, even in the most uncertain times.\\xa0']","250":"['The world of college sports was stunned March 12. In a span of just four hours, conferences across the country canceled tournaments, the University suspended athletics activities and the NCAA canceled all championship events for winter and spring sports.

The entire Virginia Athletics community continues to grapple with the consequences of last week\u2019s events.', \"\u201cIt was incredibly difficult to tell our coaches and our student-athletes that their seasons were done,\u201d Athletics Director Carla Williams said. \u201cBut we've got great coaches, we've got great student athletes, and as disappointed as everyone was, everyone understands. Everyone understands that it's the right thing to do.\u201d\", 'Amidst the turmoil of last week, Virginia Athletics spearheaded the movement to halt operations in light of the coronavirus pandemic.

The choice wasn\u2019t easy, but for them, the correct course of action became clear as more information became available.', \"\u201cWe've been meeting constantly about this and reading and gathering as much information as we could,\u201d Williams said. \u201cAnd so we've just stayed as informed as we could try to stay ahead of the curve \u2026 because we know [the situation] changed a lot in 72 hours, and there'll be a lot more changes as we move forward, and we will continue to meet and monitor and make decisions.\u201d\", 'From staying in communication with all relevant parties to helping student-athletes with their living arrangements to meeting with every coach and administrator, Williams responded quickly to a dynamic and unprecedented situation.\\xa0', 'While Williams and her team are tasked with the responsibility of making program-wide decisions, coaches have the burden of being on the front line when these decisions are made. When Virginia officially suspended athletics activities Thursday afternoon, coaches of winter and spring sports had to immediately stop what they were doing and deal with the extraordinary situation.\\xa0', 'Coach Brian O\u2019Connor and the Virginia baseball team were en route to Pittsburgh for a series against the Panthers when Williams informed them to delay their departure from a Hagerstown, Md. mall. Eventually, the team was informed to turn around the bus and return to Charlottesville.

At the local level, the University extended spring break and moved classes online, the Virginia Festival of the Book was canceled and multiple upcoming events at John Paul Jones Arena \u2014 including the Dan + Shay concert and the Harlem Globetrotters show \u2014 were postponed. Movie premieres have been delayed and museums are closing left and right.', 'News about the coronavirus has been unavoidable, and the fact that many forms of traditional escapism have been banned has made fear of the virus even more overwhelming. It\u2019s hard not to feel hopeless right now, and honestly, taking the time to wallow in disappointment is fully valid. We are allowed to be upset that our spring break plans were canceled, we are allowed to miss our friends and favorite classes and we are allowed to be scared.\\xa0', 'That said, we also need to exhibit widespread compassion in the face of contagion. The disruption of social scenes across the globe will impact the incomes of many who make a living by interacting with the public, including those in the entertainment industry. The local Charlottesville arts scene has been a staple part of the student experience at the University, and one way we can all feel like we\u2019re doing something to help is by supporting the arts scene from afar. Here are a few ways you can do just that.', 'Donate a portion of ticket refunds\\xa0', 'Large gatherings are being banned all across the nation, meaning that ticket refunds are in the futures of many disappointed patrons. This also means that a lot of local venues, organizations and people are losing money. One way to combat this is by donating a portion of your ticket refund to the theater or organization that was supposed to host the canceled event. The Paramount Theater, one of the premiere local venues in Charlottesville, sent an email out to past patrons asking for donations in lieu of ticket refunds. The Paramount is a nonprofit organization that already relies on community donations to cover operating costs \u2014 donations alone usually cover only a third of the total cost. Now, with no ticket sales, the importance of donating is \u2014 pardon the pun \u2014 paramount. \\xa0Information on donating to different venues can generally be found on the organization\u2019s website. Many of us expected to be out that amount of money anyway, so donating at least some portion so that we can go to events in the future is actually not an unreasonable ask.', 'If you are able, perhaps donate to events that usually aren\u2019t ticketed. The Virginia Festival of the Book, an event that is usually free to attend, published a short announcement on the importance of donating, reminding the public that, \u201cthe festival is free of charge, not free of cost.\u201d\\xa0', 'Take advantage of the ways in which local businesses are adapting', 'For small business owners all across Charlottesville, the combination of social distancing and much of the University student population being gone means that a large chunk of the consumer base has disappeared. Many people still have to go out to work even in the face of social distancing, so look up how your favorite small businesses are adapting to the change. Many local restaurants and cafes \u2014 such as Milli Coffee Roasters \u2014 are offering carside or delivery-based service. The New Dominion Bookshop is following suit, closing their public browsing space but offering over the phone purchases that can be delivered to your doorstep or picked up curbside at the store. Gift cards can also be purchased over the phone.\\xa0', 'Make use of digital money transferring\\xa0', 'Many freelance creatives, activists and speakers \u2014 especially those on the local level \u2014 have had their main form of income completely eradicated due to social distancing. Events are being canceled months ahead of time, meaning a lot of these people have had their expected budgets and access to resources thrown into the unknown. Take a moment to search social media to see if the person you were going to see is promoting a Patreon or other form of digital content that you can financially support \u2014 this is a good place for a portion of ticket refunds to go to as well.\\xa0', 'Through Patreon, financial support gets you exclusive content from the creator. If you\u2019re looking for a local activist to support, grassroots activist and first-year College student Zyahna Bryant, who has had all of her upcoming engagements canceled in the face of COVID-19, has set up a Patreon. If you were going to see a very famous artist, look up local equivalents that may need the money more. A good place to start would be the lists of canceled shows and events provided by local venues.', 'Outside of the Patreon route, reach out directly to artists and creatives of all kinds to see if they offer direct digital downloads of their work, or, if the work is a physical piece of art, if they could accommodate shipping or curbside pickup. This allows the artist to set the price without any middlemen taking a cut. When it comes to music, keep streaming smaller artists, and maybe support the artist via Bandcamp, which provides fairer pay to artists compared to traditional streaming platforms.', 'These three methods are by no means a comprehensive list of everything that could be done to support the local arts scene, or of every organization, person or group that needs support, but they are a place to start. It\u2019s critical that we implement social distancing to protect the most vulnerable among us, even though the immediate sacrifice of the things we love and were excited for really stings. Supporting the local arts scene from afar, no matter how small the contribution, will help protect an industry that is based around bringing people together.

I was irrationally skeptical that it could actually spread to Florence. But Feb. 25, it came to Florence. Schools were starting to send students home, which seemed like an overreaction to me. I prayed that the University and my abroad program, the International Studies Institute, would not do the same. I constantly checked my email for alerts. We were just repeatedly told by ISI and the University that Florence was not dangerous and to simply mind normal hygiene.', 'While the outbreaks were rising, I was preparing for my spring break.

An email from the University finally came the same day, listing the Centers for Disease Control precautions, but reminding us that Italy was still safe. It then mentioned we would have to return to the U.S. if Italy was given a Level 3 warning, meaning the CDC recommends not traveling there because of a widespread, ongoing transmission, and there would be an option for online class. However, there was no information on refunds, housing or a timeline for when this could happen, and there was no advisory to prepare for such an emergency.\\xa0', 'The next day, we received an encouraging letter from the mayor of Florence. It mentioned how the emergency and infections were mainly in the north and there were no risks in Florence, so we should not spread unmotivated alarm. It also mentioned how stronger measures were not being considered. This only affirmed my view that Florence was fine and that I would be returning to Italy after break. That very same day, the CDC declared all of Italy a Level 3 warning country.\\xa0', 'The University was not the first to inform me of this emergency. I arrived at my hostel in Lisbon, and somehow, three other girls from the University were in my room. They had been studying abroad in Milan, which I prematurely pitied because I knew more schools were closing there. They then informed me of the University\u2019s decision to close all study abroad programs in Italy, and I panicked.

I received no answer. I followed up with a second email. As of Wednesday, no one has responded to either my emails or questions following the declaration, and any follow up communication from University officials simply told me classes would be online and I had to leave. Five days after we were told to leave, the University emailed all students studying in Italy that they had to self-quarantine, which I felt to be an unsafe delay of health information.\\xa0', 'I was still in denial at this point and was experiencing all five stages of grief.

In those moments, I lacked empathy, and I am so regretful.\\xa0', 'My dad kept begging me to come home, yet I still refused. With online class, it seemed too easy to stay in Europe, rather than returning home, since my location no longer mattered. In all honesty, I was dreading online class since my previous experience with my online financial accounting course was what had made me desire to go abroad in the first place. I could not imagine having to complete an entire course load via virtual instruction, and my anxiety began to build up.', 'We were given an extra two weeks without class after our spring break for our professors to figure out their courses online. However, it was never stated how exactly this would work. How could we tune into video classes when the time difference was so vast between the two continents? Emails poured in from professors admitting they had no idea how to use the online resources, and they begged for patience. These professors are people too \u2014 people forced to turn an in-person class to a completely online one in just two weeks while directly suffering from the trauma of the current circumstances in Italy \u2014 and their struggles need empathy too.', 'I actually returned to Florence for one day so I could grab my essentials. Despite being a Level 3 country, it was astonishingly normal upon my return. I made sure to hit all of my favorite spots to try to support local businesses, and aside from a few popular places being bare of tourists, the city really felt the same. People were still jovial, and it seemed unfair that a city with so few cases at that point had to suffer.', 'From Florence, I did not return to the U.S. I stuck by my desire to not return home. I completed the rest of my spring break plans since I had already paid for the flights. At one point, I was visiting my friend studying in Madrid, and she told me her apartment mates were nervous since I had been in Italy. This prejudice was something I had never felt in my life, and I quickly got angry and felt they were misinformed and overreacting. This small interaction opened my eyes to what so many others are facing on such a harsher level every day and how even in a crisis, people can become more individualistic and apathetic.', 'From Spain, I took the flight I had booked to Prague before the pandemic started. From there, I took a train to Poland to stay with family. For me, it seemed like the perfect escape \u2014 I could stay in Europe and be in a country with zero reported cases of COVID-19. My friend from the University of Colorado, Boulder came with me, as she had also been studying in Florence and had quickly become my adventure buddy and, now, friend for life. It was only when I was in Poland, 11 days after the notice to leave, that U.Va. contacted me, asking about my return to the U.S and my mandatory withdrawal form for ISI. Despite having my previous questions ignored, I was told refunds would only be given on need-based conditions and to have patience. This failure of communication is part of why I was refusing a flight home.', 'I am incredibly fortunate my family provided a place for me to stay in Poland for this indefinite time. I left my large suitcase in Italy to be shipped home, so I continuously wore dirty clothes just to make the situation work. It was getting exhausting though, and I just wanted to be in Florence. I kept traveling around Europe because of the glimmer of hope that maybe I could feasibly fly back to Florence if things got better. But once Italy was raised to a Level 4 by the CDC \u2014 meaning do not travel at all to the country \u2014 I realized this fantasy was nothing more than a pipe dream.', 'I eventually agreed to return to the U.S. after spending around two weeks outside of Italy \u2014 the equivalent of a typical self-quarantine period that I hoped would help me avoid self-quarantining in the U.S. I know this decision was selfish, and while I was not at risk, I could have harmed others. People keep trying to underestimate the virus by claiming that it only kills the elderly or those with preexisting health conditions, but the elderly and immunocompromised are people, too, so we should be concerned for their lives as well, not just our own.\\xa0', 'A few days before I was scheduled to leave, the University announced it was sending home all study abroad students in Europe and canceling class on Grounds, causing immediate panic. Now, my peers back home were experiencing the pain I had been feeling for the past two weeks, as the issue started directly impacting them. It\u2019s interesting how that worked, how things suddenly seemed to matter once their world crashed too.\\xa0', 'I am not trying to belittle the issue of canceled in-person classes by any means. I never wanted others to feel the pain I felt when my semester ended. But I hope others take this as a chance to acknowledge the importance of empathy. While you may still feel safe, others may not. Think of how lucky you are. Think of your elderly professors or coaches who would be in danger if we continued classes and athletic events. It could be so much worse, and we need to prevent that.', 'I was sound asleep March 11 when President Donald Trump announced the travel ban from Europe, but my parents were awake. They rushed to book flights while sites were crashing and miraculously found me a way home. My friend and I woke up at 5 a.m. as if our bodies knew something was not right. I saw texts from friends asking if I was stuck, missed calls from my parents and ultimately an itinerary in my email for my return to the U.S.', 'I am so fortunate to have been in this specific situation where I could afford a last minute ticket, especially with the University\u2019s lack of an explicit offer to cover the cost of students\u2019 immediate return home. Through this experience, I realized how silly I was for thinking I was untouchable. Things could have gotten so much worse \u2014 I could have gotten sick or stuck abroad after the travel ban.\\xa0', 'While I still dislike the outcome of my semester abroad, I am glad I am safe. I am glad I had the best two months, and I hope to return to Italy once the situation is better as the current situation in Italy is immensely upsetting. Our professors tell us they are not allowed to be out of their homes after 6 p.m., and during the day they can only leave for the grocery store and the pharmacy. However, in the evenings there are flash mobs from apartment balconies where people blast music and rejoice together. It is positivity like that which affirms my love for Italy and its optimistic and vibrant culture.', 'I try to think everything happens for a reason. But that does not mean we should be any less cautious or careless because we are dealing with a global emergency. Try to take a look at others\u2019 perspectives during this time. While you may feel like you are not sick, you could still be a risk to the people around you, even your most loved ones. Monitor your responses to those who are affected, and try to channel a little empathy.

Beginning March 19, the University will hold all of its classes online. Additionally, they strongly urge all students to either stay home or return home if they are currently in Charlottesville. This policy will be reevaluated after April 5 at the earliest, but in light of many other schools having already committed to online courses for the rest of the semester, the University following suit would come as no surprise.', \"Make no mistake, what follows is not a critique of the University's response to the COVID-19 outbreak, but rather a suggestion as to where U.Va. ought to go from here. With all in-person classes being canceled and subsequently moved online for the time being, it is only fair that the University charge students online tuition rates while these changes are in place.\\xa0\", 'Currently, the average cost per credit hour across all undergraduate programs is $603 for in-state students and $1,704 for out-of-state students. The 2019-20 cost for fully online undergraduate and certificate programs is listed as $442 per credit hour. Students are required to complete 120 credits to graduate, so one can assume the average student is currently taking 15 credits this semester.', 'There are roughly 19 weeks in the 2020 spring academic semester. The average semester tuition cost across undergraduate programs is currently $9,045 in-state and $25,560 out-of-state, which breaks down to $476 and $1,345 per week respectively. For online programs, the cost of a 15 credit semester would be $6,630, about $349 per week. If the University adjusts its costs to the new policy, the average cost of tuition will decrease by $127 per week for in-state students and $996 per week for out-of-state students. With about 9 weeks left in the semester, and a reasonable chance students do not return to normal classes for the remainder of the year, converting to online tuition would lower the average cost for the rest of the semester by $1,143 for in-state rates and $5,823 out-of-state. Obviously, costs vary by program at the University, meaning this calculation serves as a rough estimate, however, it provides an overview of how significant this tuition change would be.\\xa0', 'I am aware President Jim Ryan and the rest of the University staff did not want to make the decision to cancel on-Grounds classes for the foreseeable future \u2014 however, great changes come with great repercussions. In this case, students deserve to be reimbursed for the difference between the current tuition they pay and the lower cost of online tuition. I am not saying that the University is currently refusing to compensate their students, as they have not had the chance with the policy being announced only days ago. My goal here is to ensure we do not get wrapped up in the chaos which is COVID-19 and forget to appropriately adjust the already high costs of attending college to levels that fairly reflect the University\u2019s policy change. The University is making an effort to do their best in a bad situation, but students did not sign up to attend the University of Virginia - Online.', 'In conjunction with tuition changes, the University will also need to account for potential housing and dining reimbursement. Students who are able to return home and heed the University\u2019s warning to stay away from U.Va. should not continue to be charged for housing and meals they are being advised to avoid. It is wise to encourage students to steer clear of Charlottesville altogether if they are going to move online, but failing to reimburse students for their cooperation leaves little incentive for students to actually obey these warnings. If individuals are still paying for dining or housing, they will be put in a situation where they are forced to choose between following Ryan\u2019s advice or getting use out of the services they already paid for \u2014 two choices which should not be mutually exclusive.\\xa0', \"Again, I commend the University\u2019s timely and responsible efforts for dealing with such unforeseen and potentially dangerous circumstances. I believe that Ryan and the rest of the University's faculty are making all of their decisions with the best interests of students in mind. However, I am writing about reimbursement so that the University can also account for our financial interests as a result of their new policy. Students should be charged for the services they are provided, meaning if the University is moving online, students should pay online tuition. Additionally, students encouraged to stay home should not continue to bear the financial burden of services that they would be kept away from if they follow the University\u2019s advice. As we move forward under this new policy, I believe it is the responsibility of U.Va., as well as other colleges and universities adopting similar policies, to appropriately compensate their students.\\xa0\", 'Cameron Cox is a third-year in the Batten School.\\xa0', 'The opinions expressed in this column are not necessarily those of The Cavalier Daily.

These factors would make the virus incredibly harmful to any student who is infected by potentially interrupting their studies for months. Not only could this disease significantly impact a student\u2019s education and potentially delay their graduation, but the disease could even be fatal in its worst cases. With the recent advent of COVID-19 cases in Washington, D.C. and as many as eight cases in Virginia, the University must take action to contain the virus and protect both its students and faculty from its spread.\\xa0', 'The University currently has put forth no mandatory action domestically to prepare for the virus, only cancelling its trips abroad. Though no cases have been reported in the University community thus far, students will soon be returning from spring break travel \u2014 possibly from international travel \u2014 and thus risk exposing the community at large. Additionally, COVID-19 poses the highest risk to older people, a group that includes many of the University\u2019s faculty who will come into contact with hundreds of students every day. The University must take time off from in-person lectures immediately after spring break \u2014 this would allow for the isolation of at-risk individuals until the incubation period has passed in order to avoid a health crisis.', 'While shutting down the University for any amount of time may seem like an overreaction to a virus that has not even reached the University community yet, taking time off now would be the least disruptive way to reach the two-week incubation period. Online classes are clearly a viable option as shown by Stanford University\u2019s two-week closure. In fact, this would be a very small measure compared to Japan\u2019s preventative measures of closing all schools for approximately a month \u2014 something ordered directly by the prime minister. These closings are key to contain the outbreak of a global pandemic that the United States is \u201cwildly unprepared\u201d to handle. These closings are, in fact, not as disruptive as they seem \u2014 many classes at the University already provide recorded lectures at students\u2019 requests, which allow for learning to continue without in-person classes. Online lectures have been demonstrated to be almost equally as effective as a traditional classroom environment, indicating that switching to recorded lectures and online assignments would not be significantly detrimental to students.', 'Students being infected with COVID-19 would significantly impact their education to an unacceptable degree. This does not even consider the risk of faculty being infected, which would derail classes for hundreds of students for months on end \u2014 the risk of widespread interruption for the entire school is far greater than the disruption that would be suffered by a week or two of quarantine. Regardless of any costs or benefits of eliminating in-class lectures for two weeks, the safety of students must be the most important consideration in all scenarios \u2014 cancelling or making classes remote for two weeks is the only way to ensure their safety.', 'The University clearly understands the gravity of the situation \u2014 they have cancelled spring break trips and cancelled all study abroad programs to level three infection sites. The University\u2019s international policy is clearly well set up for this situation, but their domestic policy leaves much to be desired. The No. 1 priority should be making sure the immediate community is safe and secure. Currently, this is not happening. This failure threatens the security of the University and does not instill confidence in students returning from spring break threatened by widespread panic over COVID. Additionally, a surprising amount of misinformation about the virus has been propagated online, and students at the University have not been thoroughly educated on how to contain its spread \u2014 information on how to effectively self-quarantine is an essential next step for the University to take in addition to direct action on behalf of students.', 'Perhaps the most important component of this issue is the uncertainty students are faced with. They return without knowing if any of their peers have been infected or exposed to the virus, and they do not know if there are any preventative measures in place for when the virus inevitably makes its way to Grounds. Students will be returning worried about their health and safety and possibly be unable to concentrate on their studies. The University owes its students a safe and healthy environment, and this simply cannot exist without cancelling in-person classes and creating a viable opportunity for students to self-quarantine.', 'Carson Flickinger is a Viewpoint Writer for the Cavalier Daily.

Currently, the vast majority of students within the College of Arts and Sciences find themselves needing to complete course requirements across a range of subjects in order to graduate. A prescribed system such as this undoubtedly hinders individuals from pursuing their academic interests while also burdening students who lacked access to advanced coursework in high school. Consequently, the University should do away with course requirements that extend beyond what is necessary for a student\u2019s chosen major.', 'The College\u2019s curriculum has recently undergone its first major change in over 40 years. In October 2019, the faculty voted to adopt the New College Curriculum. This program of study includes new thematic engagement courses alongside a series of area requirements under the umbrella of literacies and disciplines credits. Additionally, the Forums curriculum requires students to complete a set of courses clustered around several overarching topics. The logic behind these requirements is both admirable and understandable \u2014 the faculty wishes to ensure that students receive a well-rounded education by forcing undergraduates to take courses outside their major. While I do not disagree with the benefits of academic exploration, I find the necessity for such requirements at the University dubious. Given the fact that the University has competitive admissions, and 90 percent of first-years report being in the top 10 percent of their graduating class, it is safe to assume that the average student is already self motivated and curious enough to pursue an array of subjects by their own volition.', 'A number of other colleges, such as Brown and Amherst, have already done away with area requirements. Moreover, Echols scholars \u2014 an honors program enrolling roughly 5 percent of students in the College \u2014 \\xa0already find themselves exempt from mandated courses outside of their major. It is hard to imagine that students at these universities and Echols scholars have, in the absence of enforced area requirements, spent their undergraduate careers taking only a narrow selection of courses. It would therefore be more natural and less anxiety-inducing to allow students to organically select classes that align with their interests without being forced to accommodate imposed general education requirements. This increased latitude and freedom will also likely inspire a more intimate sense of ownership for one\u2019s own education.', 'The imposition of area requirements also creates situations where passionate students may be dissuaded from pursuing advanced or graduate-level coursework within their major due to a necessity to fulfill graduation requirements. In this instance, I would argue that the marginal benefit of having a student take a 4000-level or higher course that they are genuinely interested in is greater than that of mandating that they take an unrelated introductory course in a subject they are not planning to pursue. As a result, the University should not place artificial roadblocks in the way of students wishing to challenge themselves by taking courses that align with their academic interests or professional aspirations.', 'Even if one disagrees with the above reasoning, it cannot be denied that general education requirements have a disparate impact on students from rural or low-income school districts. A \\xa02018 analysis by the Government Accountability Office found that 28.8 percent of American high schools offered no Advanced Placement classes, and 30.6 percent offered no dual enrollment options. These schools that lacked opportunities to earn college credits tended to be disproportionately small and impoverished. Consequently, students coming from these school districts find themselves at a disadvantage when compared to their peers who had the benefit of taking Advanced Placement or community college classes back in high school. This results in students from small or impoverished districts needing to devote a larger proportion of their already limited class schedule toward fulfilling general education requirements.\\xa0', 'Unfortunately, this inequity means that students from such backgrounds experience heightened difficulty when attempting to complete either multiple majors or majors with extensive credit requirements within four years. It should be the aim of the College to help, not hinder students from under-resourced school districts in achieving their academic goals. However, the New College Curriculum\u2019s requirements may in fact inhibit an individual\u2019s aspirations.', \"Ultimately, the New College Curriculum and the principle of general education requirements are well-intentioned. Yet, in their implementation, these policies stifle self-exploration and perpetuate inequity on Grounds. The current curriculum may have value as an optional or recommended program, but mandatory courses outside of one's major should be done away with if the University is to truly live up to Jefferson\u2019s vision.\", 'Max Bresticker is an Opinion Columnist for The Cavalier Daily.

The five panelists discussed the influence of systemic racism on food accessibility and farm working conditions and common problems \u2014\\xa0including food security and worker safety \u2014 while urging the public to become more involved in food-related policy, especially in the Charlottesville community.\\xa0', 'The event was hosted as an open dialogue between five food justice experts and was moderated by Assoc. Politics Prof. Paul Freedman. Audience members had the opportunity to chime in with a question-and-answer box and there were real-time polls throughout.\\xa0', 'Tanya Denckla \u2014\\xa0director of the University\u2019s Institute for Engagement and Negotiation, which fosters collaboration on environmental issues \u2014\\xa0explained that the cracks in the modern food system are reflective of past inequities in agriculture. For example, Cobb explained that this industry still depends upon enslaved laborers, but modern slavery takes different forms. This is why she emphasized that at its core, food justice is a basic right.\\xa0', '\u201cFood justice is \u2026 the ability to exercise core human rights of self determination about the most important thing, which is our food,\u201d Cobb said.', 'Dr. Basil Gooden \u2013 former Virginia Secretary of Agriculture and Forestry \u2013 pointed out that the issue of food justice entails more than our daily meals. As state director for the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s rural development in the Commonwealth, he witnessed firsthand the positive impact that agriculture can yield on economic well being, health and quality of life. Conversely, injustices in the food system spawn ripple effects across all of these aspects.\\xa0', '\u201c[Food justice] encompasses everything from the producing to the end consumer,\u201d Gooden said. \u201cThe big problem that we are having is the disparity and the inequities that are rife throughout the entire system.\u201d', 'Gooden also noted that over time, we have outsourced everything from educating our children to feeding our families, so we have a strained relationship with the food we consume. While historically societies have grown or foraged for food, today we interact with our meals in the context of a supermarket or a fast-food takeout box. This spatial separation between dining plates and farms leads to the dissociation of farms with our dinner plates.\\xa0', \"\u201cWe have become disconnected with how our food is actually produced, and who's actually produced it, and that most important part \u2014 under what conditions.\u201d Gooden said.\", 'During the panel discussion, viewers were asked how much they knew about where their food comes from. The most popular response \u2014 selected by 43 percent of respondents \u2014 was \u201calmost nothing.\u201d Christianne Queiroz, program director of Virginia Farm Workers, said that she was unsurprised by the responses.', \"\u201c[The poll result] does not surprise me from the point of view of the lack of visibility of farm workers and their lives and conditions,\u201d Queiroz said. \u201cI think that's what actually generates a lot of moral apathy towards the situation of farmworkers in the country.\u201d\", 'In reaction to the poll result, Freedman directed the discussion toward addressing the role of consumers.', '\u201cI think we should ask, \u2018Why do we have a food system in which we know so little, in which it is so hard to achieve a level of transparency to learn about our food?\u2019\u201d Freedman said.', 'Freedman argued that while it may be human nature to blame consumers for their decision-making, the public must adopt a holistic perspective by acknowledging that the food system itself is a \u201cmoral failure.\u201d As it stands, the system intentionally leaves consumers in the dark, which leads to passive eaters and a disconnection from nature, though the panelists presented several potential solutions to propel food system reform.', 'One proposed solution involved communicating the importance of reconnecting with the land. Shantell Bingham, program director of Charlottesville Food Justice Network, mentioned that she is the great granddaughter of tobacco sharecroppers and in North Carolina, and she practices gratitude for the native people that were the first stewards of the land.', 'In a similar vein, Cobb appreciated indigenous agricultural practices by partaking in a feast. She was invited to a meal hosted by the I-Collective, \u201can autonomous group of Indigenous chefs, activists, herbalists, seed and knowledge keepers.\u201d At the meal, each dish was foraged from local land and prepared utilizing ancestral methods.', \"\u201cThey shared with us over lunch their perspective on food justice \u2026 [for them], it is about the connection of us to our food and to the land,\u201d Cobb said. \u201cThey made a point of saying that you have likely never tasted food that tastes like this because you've never cooked it this way \u2014 with the land that it comes from.\u201d\", 'Cobb suggests that similar events at the University in the future could broaden perspectives and advance these conversations.', 'Cobb also noted that the public can bring lasting change to the food system through the different financial choices. For instance, the University spends $11 million on the 2 million meals it produces annually. Shifting even a portion of that spending towards Black and brown farmers has the power to shape livelihoods, Cobb said. She also mentioned that University Dining has a goal of 30 percent food expenditure on sustainable foods \u2014 which encompasses local produce \u2014 by 2030. In 2017, U.Va. Dining\u2019s sustainable food purchases were 8.6 percent of its food expenditures.', 'Additionally, Queiroz pointed out that immigration reform laws \u2014 including federal regulations surrounding work visas \u2014 are an integral component of the food justice fight. She recommends that people contact their representatives and make their opinions known on proposed legislation.\\xa0', 'In her closing remarks, Bingham echoed these sentiments and emphasized the importance of both local and national policies. She urged listeners to keep in mind that food justice entails equality for all \u2014 a concept that unites Black and Indigenous farmers alike.', 'Gooden summed up his message with an excerpt from Dr. Vernon Johns, a civil rights activist and pastor.\\xa0', '\u201c\u2018If you see a good fight, get in it,\u2019\u201d Gooden quoted.\\xa0', 'He stated that most importantly, the public should seek involvement in this \u201cgood fight\u201d for equality in our food system. Gooden challenged listeners to take action and realize the power they hold as individuals to enact change.\\xa0', 'Lastly, Cobbs noted that alumni hold influence over the Board of Visitors and University President Jim Ryan, as they can utilize their voices in an effort to hold the University accountable in becoming a leader in the movement for sustainable and just food.', 'In Freedman\u2019s parting words, he emphasized that the future of the food system is in our hands.', '\u201cWe are all eaters, we are all part of the food system, we all get to make decisions and choices,\u201d Freedman said. \u201cLet us think about how those choices affect food justice.\u201d\\xa0']","280":"['The University released early action decisions Friday, extending offers of admission to 6,187 candidates out of a total of 28,897 applicants \u2014 a 21.4 percent offer rate. 40 percent of those admitted are students of color, 7 percent are foreign nationals and 46 percent are white.\\xa0', 'The application pool for early action admission to the Class of 2025 saw a record 15 percent increase over those for the Class of 2024 when 25,160 applied.

During the Trump presidency, Irving said that there was a less than satisfactory effort to address either problems around online learning or internet accessibility.', 'The panelists emphasized that the pandemic\u2019s forced transition to online learning has exacerbated the digital divide, making disparities among racial and socioeconomic classes that much clearer.\\xa0', '\u201cI was surprised to see the same issue appearing in very different regions \u2014\\xa0teachers could teach with new tools, but when they assigned homework, they couldn\u2019t be confident that all students would have access to it,\u201d Rosenworcel said.', 'Rosenworcel called this phenomenon the \u201chomework gap,\u201d which refers to students without reliable access to broadband internet at home, and believes it necessitates attention as a matter of educational equity. According to Rosenworcel, 16 to 17 million students fall into the homework gap because of lack of access to online educational resources.\\xa0', 'Rosenworcel said that the E-Rate program \u2014 which was created as a byproduct of the 1996 Telecommunications Act to make sure schools and libraries all over the U.S. had access to the internet \u2014 needs to be expanded to homes so that students are connected at all times, making sure that \u201cno child [is] left offline.\u201d', 'Rosenworcel also discussed smaller-scale solutions, such as allowing students to borrow Wi-Fi hotspots from the library, blanketing communities with broadband to make sure every student has access to the internet and using a \u201cWiFi on wheels\u201d system, which involves installing routers on school buses that then stop in areas with low internet accessibility.', 'Meng said she has appreciated the recent increase in interest in internet accessibility as a result of the pandemic. Before then, she pointed out that discussions about equitable access to education and opportunity were based upon an assumption that everyone has reliable access to the Internet which, Meng said, should be considered a human right in this day and age.\\xa0', '\u201cWe have an inherent duty to make sure our students have the tools that they need to succeed,\u201d Meng said.', 'The panel also discussed the barriers that impede networks from expanding into rural areas, including a lack of sufficient and focused spending by the federal government on infrastructure. According to Irving, the immediate need is not only getting people online in the short term, but making sure there is an affordable way of keeping them connected in the future as well.\\xa0', 'Meng brought some optimism into the discussion with her explanation of a bill being prepared by the Rural Broadband Task Force \u2014 led by House Majority Whip James E.

Irving pointed out that the economic disparities, such as increasing unemployment among blue-collar jobs, exacerbated by the pandemic have a lot to do with people\u2019s access to technology, especially for those whose jobs don\u2019t allow them to conveniently work from home. As an example, Irving honed in on Queens, where small businesses who could not continue their business online were forced to close.\\xa0', 'Still, Rosenworcel said that there have been some of the positive sides of the shift to online because we are \u201cstarting to understand what\u2019s possible\u201d with the Internet, especially in reference to telehealth services, which have greatly expanded amid the pandemic. However, it\u2019s still necessary to \u201creach some communities who have been left behind.\u201d', 'In response to a question from the audience, speakers said that \u201cmaking noise\u201d is one of the biggest catalysts in introducing new legislation and driving change.

On the cover, Styles is pictured wearing beautiful garments ranging from a Gucci lace-trimmed dress, to pleated skirts, to pants of intricate artistry and more. This moment was special because a major, accredited fashion magazine recognized the beauty of gender fluidity and the ability to express oneself through clothing. To many, this Vogue cover was a win except for \u2014 the prominent conservative social-media personalities \u2014 \\xa0Candace Owens and Ben Shapiro.

Upon further reflection, however, the most surprising aspect of Owens and Shapiro\u2019s comments was the antiquated, close-minded view of masculinity being championed predominantly by conservative social-media personalities.\\xa0', 'Societies cannot be steadily feminized. Among the World Health Organization, prominent political philosophers and scientists, gender is known to be \u201csocially constructed.\u201d As a person grows and recognizes their identity, they have a better understanding of themselves. From theory written by Judith Butler and Simone de Beauvoir, they describe the idea that gender is not a stable theory but an accumulation of stylized repeated activities. Therefore, it is invalid to describe masculinity as a group of identical, unchanging traits. Under no definition of masculinity does it have requirements detailing what a man can or cannot wear. Also, if it did, what a boring society we would live in. And lastly, true masculinity comes from feeling comfortable within yourself, not buying into the age-old American philosophy of traditional masculinity.\\xa0', \"As the United States and countries around the world become accepting of people\u2019s preferences when it comes to gender or clothing, people like Owens and Shapiro play into the problematic culture of toxic masculinity. While each of us is assigned a biological sex when we are born, the genetics between men and women are not what creates differentiation. In fact, it is societal norms. And for years, men have been forced into the societal norms of wearing stereotypical men's fashion and maintaining an emotionless exterior. Still, once people start to make public leaps toward fluidity in gender and fashion \u2014 it is important to emphasize public because for many years men have been bending the norms of masculinity and fashion \u2014 there is push to restrict men back into those stereotypical roles.\\xa0\", 'The idea of androgyous or uni-sex clothing has not started with Harry Styles and certaintly will not end with him. First, there have been famous public figures for decades that, despite their gender or sexual orientation, have popularized and normalized the bending of clothing gender norms. These figures range from Prince to David Bowie. Second, to limit the definition of masculinity to a specific set of clothing items serves to alienate men in cultures around the world. For example, it is common in Scottish culture to wear kilts \u2014 a skirt-like item of clothing \u2014 or in India, women and men wear the traditional clothing of saris \u2014 which can also resemble dresses. And finally, this emphasis of traditional masculinity ideology is harmful to men\u2019s mental health. Men are taught to dress a certain way to exude the accurate type of masculinity. However, the repercussions this has on male mental health is enormous. The feeling of being closed off to options or having the ability to speak with other men on their feelings has led to men feeling alone and burdened with mental health issues. For example, this stigma has extended to the workplace. A Harvard Business Review study found that maintaining a superiority of masculinity and unsaid dress code of masculine fashions stifles innovation, productivity and leads to an unfulfilling work environment.\\xa0', 'All of this being said, there are no benefits to limiting the exploration of gender and fashion. Men should wear whatever they want, especially when it leads to more fulfilling relationships, better mental health and a reduced stigma of gender expansive identities as a whole.\\xa0', 'Evelyn Duross is a Viewpoint Writer for The Cavalier Daily.

Prof. Shilpa Dav\u00e9 and Prof. Camilla Fojas during January Term this year. It framed contemporary movements through the lens of historical movements and incorporated the study of how media can be strategically used to gain visibility, amplify a message or challenge a social norm. This course allowed me to reflect on how social issues affect the intersectionality of my personal values and experiences with the important aspects of social movements, such as community.', 'I was drawn to this course primarily because of the relevance and timeliness of the subject matter as I could put this course in conversation with current events, such as the Black Lives Matter protests, and even more recently, the insurrection at the Capitol Jan. 6.', 'Through the class\u2019 screenings, images, articles and insightful guest speakers, this course broadened my understanding of social movements by providing insight into the intellectual history that informs contemporary movements, as well as the various cultural forms of artistic expression, such as music, art and rhetoric that many social movements utilize to achieve their goals. For example, the BLM movement is heavily influenced by the Black Panther Party movement\u2019s contributions and political framing, such as the raised fist that is used as a symbol of the BLM movement now.', 'Furthermore, many themes of this course are evident in different social movements and protest rhetoric by University students. Last fall, there was a Lawn room sign that said \u201cFuck U.Va.,\u201d which is an example of protest rhetoric against the legacy of racism at the University. It sparked controversy but also gained momentum as other students stood in solidarity to support this message. Similarly, there are also demands by the Young Democratic Socialists of America and the Black Student Alliance in leading change at the University.\\xa0', 'Through this course, I was able to think deeply about ideas that were already important to me, such as community and social justice. But I was also able to develop a new perspective on the history and nature of protest. Together, I can more fully appreciate the accomplishments of previous communities who collectively worked to produce change in their social movements.\\xa0', 'A commonality that was evident in many of the social movements we focused on was the importance of a collective effort. I have always had a fond appreciation for community, which intensified when I studied abroad in London, and had the opportunity to reflect on the connectivity in community as I immersed myself in a new group of students. This course emphasized the need for solidarity in community \u2014 social movements are group efforts and need everyone\u2019s participation and support to be successful.', 'In my own life, community has always been about the intrinsic support gained from being in a group of like-minded people. This past summer during the BLM protests, my friends and I often talked about how we felt \u2014 how helpless or powerless we felt at times. But as a Floridian living in this primarily conservative state, it was empowering to see the effects of a handful of protesters in Pensacola, manifested in the building of a memorial on one of the city\u2019s bridges.\\xa0', 'Beyond this reality of protest and conflict, I can\u2019t help but dream of a society where racism and all other forms of discrimination do not exist. This is idealistic, but it\u2019s a necessary ideal. Oftentimes we\u2019re discouraged from dreaming of a visionary or utopian society because we won\u2019t see it in our lifetimes. Some will argue it\u2019s just not feasible, but I don\u2019t believe this is true.', 'This course made me feel more hopeful for the future as the prospect of a society that isn\u2019t riddled with prejudice and injustice seems more attainable. Many social movements begin with the work of grassroots organizations. I can personally become more active in community organizing here at the University, and I urge every student to do so as well.

On Jan. 29, Slim delighted fans with a new album, \"Strawberry Mansion,\" that can only be described as a timely yet sobering work of art. \"Strawberry Mansion\" addresses everything from the pandemic to social inequality to sobriety to religion in 22 stunning songs. The album is dense, so before the album\u2019s release, Slim broke it down into three parts.', '18 of the 22 songs on the album were written in March, April and May of 2020, when the mystery and fear surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic dominated society. Part One of \"Strawberry Mansion\" beautifully tackles the wide range of emotions and devastating struggle that accompanied the early stages of the pandemic, all in the high-toned voice and acoustic instrumentation that have become staples in Langhorne Slim\u2019s music. It opens with a pair of songs that preach optimism and resilience in the face of loneliness. The second song, \u201cDreams,\u201d begins with a particularly powerful line. \u201cThere\u2019s more to this madness than smiles and sadness \/ There\u2019s more to this dance than who you can take,\u201d is a reminder to listeners to look inward as we face the tragedy of the pandemic.\\xa0', 'As Part One progresses, it gets more and more pointed. \u201cLonesome Times\u201d and \u201cSummer Days\u201d reflect on the isolation brought on by the pandemic, but perhaps the most relatable line on the album comes from the fifth song, \u201cAlright to Hide.\u201d The song masterfully masquerades the harsh reality of 2020 behind a piano riff reminiscent of a ragtime dance tune, but it bleeds out in the chorus \u2014 \u201cI told you not to go outside \/ Why would I lie \/ Don\u2019t be a dummy honey, come back inside.\u201d\\xa0', 'Part One closes out by describing the harsh psychological and interpersonal effects. \u201cPanic Attack\u201d exposes the mental health toll of the pandemic, while \u201cHouse on Fire\u201d reminisces about relationships ended by quarantine. There has been a lot of music written about the struggles of 2020, but none as transparent and relatable as Part One of \"Strawberry Mansion.\"', \"Part Two could be an album all its own. The first two songs share a common theme with much of Langhorne Slim's discography \u2014 religion. \u201cMorning Prayer\u201d and \u201cColors\u201d are slow, melodic songs that tie Slim\u2019s faith to his relationships and provide a glimpse into the inspiration of an artist who rarely shares details about his personal life. After the religious beginning, Part Two takes a quick turn and begins addressing two themes that have rocked 2020 along with COVID-19 \u2014 inequality and accountability. In a year packed with political and social change, the lines \u201cYou can spit-shine your diamonds \/ Get a big ol\u2019 swimming pool \/ But if you ain\u2019t got no one to climb in with \/ You\u2019re just another lonely high-class fool,\u201d from \u201cHigh-Class\u201d condemns wealthy, privileged people whose risky actions and behaviors during the pandemic have harmed others.\\xa0\", 'After an instrumental titular track and a nostalgic ballad for his family home in Philadelphia, Langhorne Slim turns again to one of his common themes \u2014 his own journey. The last four songs of Part Two detail the work Slim has put in to achieve the success he has today, but more importantly, they tell his fans he isn\u2019t done. In particular, \u201cSomething Higher\u201d showcases his desire to continue to grow as a musician and produce more music, something every fan should be excited about.', 'Part Three, the conclusion of the album, consists of three demo tracks \u2014 each of which touch on a motif Slim has already addressed. \u201cNowhere To Go\u201d once again tackles quarantine, while \u201cChange of Plans\u201d urges listeners to find solace in their differences and \u201cLong Journey\" reminds fans of Slim\u2019s own path to success. Like all great writing, \"Strawberry Mansion\" has a cohesive beginning, body and conclusion. It tackles hard themes in thought-provoking and insightful ways \u2014 and does so over the beautiful piano, guitar and banjo melodies that have made Slim such a prevalent artist in Americana music. If \"Strawberry Mansion\" had to be summarized, it is a reminder to reflect quietly and honestly on the past year.']","292":"['There are few things in life that are timeless \u2014 writing thank you notes, weathered paperback books and Polaroids. Even though the phenomenon began in 1948, the Polaroid and other similar instant cameras still hold prominence today, using self-developing film to produce the print of a picture taken shortly beforehand. The incredible ability to instantly capture a moment and make it tangible opens the door to thousands of possibilities \u2014 immortalizing memories, moments, emotions, celebrations and even the most mundane of occasions.\\xa0', 'People like myself are still using Polaroid cameras or similar brands to take instant pictures on film.

First, there\u2019s the burst of excitement I feel when I run my fingers over the smooth piece of film as it comes straight out of the camera. The anticipation of waiting for the picture to develop is one of the best parts \u2014 I usually try to speed up this process by waving it around in the air, although I\u2019m not sure if this actually works. Once it fully develops, the grainy and warm tones seem to reflect even warmer memories that were captured in those special instances.

Most recently, Columbia University enacted a policy on fossil fuel non-investment. However, Saltani mentioned that the University is behind other institutions, due to, in part, the fact that the University\u2019s investments are handled by UVIMCO. According to Saltani, the University has communicated to DivestUVA that the process of divesting is much more complicated than it seems due to the fact that the University\u2019s investments are handled by a third party.', '\u201cI think that the administration\u2019s hands are tied in terms of how quickly they can move money and how easily that can be done,\u201d Saltani said. \u201cThe workflow is a lot longer and I think a lot more nuanced than we know, which is why we are also speaking to the issue of transparency and kind of having a voice in the room.\u201d\\xa0', 'For this second letter, DivestUVA made it a goal to reach out to as many students and organizations as possible across Grounds in order to garner support for their cause.

It is truly remarkable to watch a player in his first year in Coach Tony Bennett\u2019s system perform so well, and Murphy is a prime example of that. He has been a sharpshooter since the moment he stepped on the court, and his defense has also improved tremendously over the season, especially on the ball. Virginia is lucky to have Murphy eligible for this season, as he is yet another offensive cog for the Cavaliers to work with.', 'Men\u2019s basketball needs to avoid the second half struggle', 'Virginia men\u2019s basketball came out of Saturday\u2019s matchup against Pittsburgh with a hard-fought 73-66 victory \u2014 but what was more impressive was the team\u2019s overall play in the second half. Over the past two games, Virginia tended to lose control in the final 20 minutes. Virginia Tech was able to blow the game wide open en route to a 65-51 loss for the Cavaliers, and NC State also kept it close throughout the second half, drawing nearly even in the period. The game against the Panthers, however, was quite different. Virginia had one of its trademark runs early in the second half, with senior guard Tomas Woldetensae, senior forward Jay Huff and senior forward Sam Hauser exploding offensively to push the lead to 16. In addition, Hauser did a particularly great job defensively on Pittsburgh\u2019s sophomore forward Justin Champagnie, holding the ACC\u2019s leading scorer to a mediocre game by his standards. The Panthers were able to make the game closer by way of a defensive press, but the Cavaliers were never in serious danger. If Virginia can play like it did in the second half on Saturday, the Cavaliers can likely beat any team in the conference.', 'The youth of men\u2019s lacrosse gives the team a bright future \u2014 and present', 'In the season opener for both teams, Virginia men\u2019s lacrosse crushed Towson 20-11 thanks to an excellent middle two quarters.

What provided a particularly optimistic feel for the season, however, was the play of the younger members of the team. Redshirt freshman attack Connor Shellenberger and sophomore attack Payton Cormier erupted offensively, each finishing with seven points on the day. Shellenberger\u2019s play was particularly exciting for Virginia, since he came in last year as the No. 1 recruit in the country before redshirting. Cormier, while not nearly as highly regarded coming out of high school, had shown flashes of promise in previous seasons before exploding for six goals against the Tigers. The offensive core for the traditionally high-scoring Cavaliers seems to be set up incredibly well for both this year and the future.', 'This will be a year of records for women\u2019s swimming', 'In their final tune-up before ACC Championships, men\u2019s and women\u2019s swimming both competed at the Cavalier Invite Feb. 5-7.

The most impressive event of the invite had to be the 200-yard breaststroke, where sophomore Kate Douglass set a both a school record and the fifth-fastest time in ACC history in the preliminary swim. If that was not enough of a sign of a great meet overall, then the four other athletes \u2014 junior Julia Menkhaus, sophomore Ella Collins, senior Caroline Gmelich and freshman Riley Tilltmann \u2014 who all set personal records across the weekend should be convincing. Overall, the second-ranked Cavaliers won seven events at the Cavalier Invite, which should provide Virginia women\u2019s swimming with a lot of confidence heading into the conference championships.', 'Men\u2019s swimming\u2019s dominance in events can mean nothing but good things', 'The women\u2019s team was not the only group of Cavaliers that had an incredible weekend at the Cavalier Invite \u2014\\xa0the men\u2019s team also clocked in a fantastic performance. But while the strength for the women\u2019s team lied in setting personal records, the men\u2019s team\u2019s forte in the invite was supremacy across multiple events. The No. 10 Cavaliers swept the podium in three different events, while also taking the top two spots in three others. Freshman Tanner Herring had a particularly spectacular weekend, winning the 1,650-yard freestyle and finishing third in two other events.

In essence, the system only works if brothers report fellow brothers for infractions. It is hard to understate how naive it is to believe a system of this sort would work.

The slight increase in revenues and decrease in expenses yielded a reduced deficit of $1,495,964, compared to $2,402,121 in 2018-19.

The next three largest sources of revenue \u2014 media rights, ticket sales and student fees \u2014 added up to over $48 million.', 'The major driver of Virginia\u2019s revenue growth was the football program. Propelled by its strong recent track record, Virginia football was directly responsible for over $43 million in revenue in 2019-20, which represents a 33 percent year-over-year increase.', '\u201cTwo of the larger drivers for revenue growth have come from an increase in the ACC distribution \u2014 which is significantly tied to football \u2014 as well as progress in our on-field football performance,\u201d Pritzker said. \u201cWe are trending in a positive trajectory, having gone from no bowl participation to competing in the Military Bowl, Belk Bowl and a New Year\u2019s Six Bowl.\u201d', 'The football team\u2019s finances benefited from increased ticket sales and contributions as well as more sales from novelties, parking and concessions \u2014 all of which can be attributed to the team\u2019s growing popularity. In addition, Virginia football enjoyed a new revenue stream in 2019-20 with over $7 million coming in from ACC distributions of bowl revenue.', 'According to Pritzker, Virginia also saw \u201can uptick in football home game revenue\u201d because the football team played one more home game in 2019 than it did in 2018, and Virginia\u2019s 2019 home schedule included a marquee matchup with in-state rival Virginia Tech.', 'Furthermore, Virginia\u2019s football program generated $11.7 million more in revenues than every other team combined.

Altogether, these revenue streams brought in $8.7 million less than the year before.', '\u201cWe receive travel reimbursements from the NCAA for attending postseason competition,\u201d Pritzker said. \u201cThe cancellation of the winter and spring championships, as well as reduced NCAA-specific revenue, led to the decline in NCAA Distributions. Additionally, there is a bit of variation in the timing of the receipt of funds from the ACC Network.\u201d', 'A major financial blow was dealt to Virginia and other schools when March Madness \u2014 the NCAA Division I Men\u2019s Basketball Tournament \u2014 was canceled. Since the tournament generates virtually all of the NCAA\u2019s revenues, the NCAA distributed $375 million less than what it had originally planned to pay out to member schools.', 'The athletics department\u2019s most substantial expense was compensation paid to head coaches, assistant coaches and their support staff. In total, Virginia Athletics paid $45.1 million to coaches and staff in 2019-20. Virginia paid a further $20.9 million in athletics aid and scholarships for student-athletes. These costs alone made up nearly 60 percent of Virginia\u2019s total operating expenses.', 'While Virginia\u2019s expenses remained fairly consistent across the board between 2018-19 and 2019-20, the department was able to realize some cost savings in a number of areas. In particular, Virginia cut costs by a total of $4.5 million in team travel and overhead and administrative expenses alone.', '\u201cThe U.Va.

Since the pandemic cut the seasons of many winter and spring sports short in 2020, Virginia did not have to pay for a significant portion of these teams\u2019 regular season and postseason travel. For example, Virginia men\u2019s basketball\u2019s travel expenses were nearly $1 million less than in 2018-19 \u2014 presumably due to the cancellation of the 2020 NCAA Tournament. Moreover, Virginia also saved hundreds of thousands of dollars in travel costs related to several other sports like baseball and lacrosse.', 'However, the majority of these cost savings were canceled out by increased spending on debt payments, leases and rental fees on athletics facilities. In 2019-20, Virginia spent $9.4 million in this category \u2014 more than twice as much as it spent the year prior. Without this development, the athletics department could have potentially posted a budget surplus for the first time since 2016.', 'After taking expenses into account, just two varsity teams were profitable in 2019-20 for Virginia Athletics. The football and men\u2019s basketball programs generated surpluses of $15.6 million and $2.4 million, respectively. On the other hand, Virginia\u2019s other varsity teams lost a combined $15.9 million, with deficits ranging from $375,262 \u2014 for women\u2019s golf \u2014 to $3.1 million \u2014 for women\u2019s basketball.

From modified schedules to the lack of fan attendance, lost revenue from ticket sales, television deals and other game-related revenue streams is expected. On top of this, Virginia will have to pay for additional expenses related to COVID-19.', '\u201cThe athletics department has spent well over $1 million in COVID testing in the fall of 2020,\u201d Pritzker said. \u201cWe have also incurred unbudgeted expenses in other COVID-related expenses, like supplies, PPE and increased sanitization, and are working our hardest to provide the safest atmosphere for our student-athletes and employees.\u201d', 'Most importantly, the college football season was heavily impacted by COVID-19 in 2020, whereas the pandemic only struck the United States after the 2019 football season was already completed. This fall, Virginia football was limited to a shorter, conference-only schedule, declined to play a bowl game and could not welcome fans to Scott Stadium.\\xa0', 'Given the football program\u2019s importance to Virginia Athletics \u2014 the team was directly linked to 39 percent of Virginia\u2019s total revenues \u2014 any loss of football revenue will certainly be felt. Although the athletics department has implemented some department-wide cost-saving measures, fully recuperating the budget shortfall will be difficult.', 'At this point, Virginia Athletics has not made any financial projections for the 2020-21 fiscal year.', 'Beyond Virginia, college athletics departments across the country have been paralyzed by the pandemic. Fellow ACC school North Carolina and SEC school Ole Miss both expect to lose around $30 million from less ticket sales and television revenue. In the Big 12, Texas Christian University reportedly lost about one-third of its revenue \u2014 or roughly $25 million \u2014 during the pandemic. If its numbers are similar to those of other Power 5 schools, Virginia could have easily lost tens of millions of dollars due to COVID-19.', 'Some sports administrators have argued that the pandemic has exposed and amplified the \u201cpre-existing structural problems in the broader economic system of college sports.\u201d In an article for AthleticDirectorU, Kevin Blue, director of intercollegiate athletics at UC Davis, highlighted that athletics departments are incentivized to spend rather than save.', 'Blue explained that athletics departments \u2014 like most non-profit organizations \u2014 often spend all of or more than their annual revenues in order to fulfill immediate needs and compete with other schools. Accordingly, without significant financial reserves, athletics departments are more vulnerable to surprises \u2014 like, for example, a pandemic.', 'In the case of Virginia Athletics, total revenues have grown 75 percent since 2005, according to the Knight Commission on Intercollegiate Athletics\u2019 College Athletics Financial Information Database. During the same period of time, Virginia\u2019s total expenses outpaced revenues, rising 87 percent. Moreover, Virginia has posted a deficit six times in the last seven years and has amassed $51.9 million in total athletics-related debt. In other words, as Blue described, Virginia Athletics seems to have prioritized short-term spending over long-term sustainability.', 'While the COVID-19 pandemic has already taken a toll on athletics departments since March, NCAA Chief Medical Officer Brian Hainline warned that the pandemic\u2019s financial effects will likely linger into 2023.

However, the only thing she feels \u201cbehind\u201d on is making new friends because of her delayed arrival.', 'For that specific predicament, Alison Nagel, clinical psychologist and program director for Hoos Connected, said that the group was designed to serve students just like Nguyen.\\xa0', 'Hoos Connected is an organization that brings together first-year and transfer students by having small group meetings Mondays at 5:30 p.m., Tuesdays at 7:30 p.m. or Wednesdays at 7 p.m. This year especially, the program aims to connect students through their housing assignments as University COVID-19 restrictions only permit residents of the same building to enter residence halls.', 'Nagel and other psychologists in her field observed connections between loneliness and isolation on both physical and mental health. According to Nagel, there has been a growing recognition of these impacts within the psychology literature. She reported that a quarter of all adults feel that they have nobody they can turn to in a time of need. This statistic \u2014 coupled with the fact that college-age students have higher rates of depression and anxiety and that there are higher utilization rates at counseling centers across the nation \u2014 prompted a \u201cperfect pairing\u201d for advertising Hoos Connected this semester.', 'With college being a time of change and transition, there can arise a \u201cnormative\u201d stage where students feel isolated or that they don\u2019t have their footing, Nagel said, especially due to the pandemic.', 'In theory, Nagel plans to help students feel \u201cbetter in their skin\u201d by gradually going from small talk about movies and TV in the earlier sessions to discussing personal identities, stories and self reflection to foster productive and \u201cmeaningful\u201d relationships with other students.', \"\u201cHoos Connected is meant to meet students where they're at in that moment by providing a space where they can get to know their peers,\u201d Nagel said. \u201cSo, first years are in groups of other first years, transfers are in groups of other transfers and [we want them to] just get to know one another, get a little bit beyond the types of conversations that we, for very good reason, are most likely to have when we're new in a space.\u201d\", 'In a randomized control trial of 438 people, or two semesters worth of participants, Nagel found that \u201cstudents who participated in Hoos Connected reported feeling significantly less depressed than the control students.\u201d', 'Despite Hoos Connected\u2019s efforts, Nguyen feels that since the University is so vast and most clubs have to meet over Zoom, the University hasn\u2019t done enough to facilitate a smooth process.', '\u201cIn the nicest way possible, I don\u2019t think U.Va. has done anything to help students who are new to Grounds spring semester,\u201d Nguyen said. \u201cI think it\u2019s just not their priority. Obviously it\u2019s a huge university so they only have so many resources, and I think they\u2019re just choosing not to direct attention to students who have just moved in because there\u2019s a relatively small number of us and in the grand scheme of things, there are more pressing issues than a small handful of new students.\u201d', 'According to University Spokesperson Brian Coy, who responded on behalf of Housing and Residential Life, the department thus far has not reported any particular challenges in accommodating incoming first-year or transfer students.', '\u201cThe University looks forward to them being part of our residential communities,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Resident Staff have been checking in with their new residents and welcoming them to Grounds.\u201d', 'New residents moved into their residence halls a few days earlier than returning residents. The day before returning residents began moving in, Resident Advisors held a meeting with new residents to welcome them to their residence halls and establish rules and responsibilities, a similar meeting to the one that first years usually attend during their first day living on-Grounds in the fall.\\xa0', 'One student in particular that has benefited from the engagement of the resident staff is first-year College student Ronith Ranjan.\\xa0', 'Ranjan \u2014 who decided to spend his first semester at home to spend more time with his family and reflect and recharge \u2014 chose to attend resident advisors meetings after he settled into Dillard dormitory and connected with other people on his floor that way.', \"\u201c[It's] a lot of making opportunities for myself,\u201d Ranjan said. \u201cThere was a guy who lives on my floor, who was really into rock climbing, so because of that, I started going with him rock climbing this past week. I would have never seen myself do something as different as that, so it's great to be on Grounds.\u201d\", 'Although Nagel said that transfer students historically have more often reaped the benefits of Hoos Connected, because of the circumstances of this year where first years are experiencing the same threshold of change that transfer students normally would, the program might work \u201cparticularly well\u201d for first years.', 'However, according to Ranjan, it doesn\u2019t matter how many resources the University gives students because, ultimately, college life is dependent on the effort individuals choose to put into it.\\xa0', '\u201cI\\'ve seen a lot of emails about Hoos Connected,\u201d Ranjan said. \u201cBut it\\'s like, I think in general, for college life, you have to go make those opportunities for yourself. Things like Hoos Connected at U.Va. will only do so much for a student. You really have to put yourself out there and meet new people, go out to lunch and dinner with people with different interests.\"', 'The deadline to sign up for Hoos Connected was Wednesday, and groups meet starting on Feb. 15.']","308":"['Amanda Gorman, activist and National Youth Poet Laureate, performed an original poem at the Super Bowl game Sunday. Her poem, \u201cChorus of the Captains,\u201d celebrated three community leaders who were named honorary Super Bowl captains by the NFL. Despite the challenges of the pandemic, each captain has shown admirable leadership. Pittsburgh-based Marine veteran James Martin volunteers with the Wounded Warrior Project and works with at-risk kids, Los Angeles educator Trimaine Davis goes the extra mile to grant his students accessibility and Tampa ICU nurse manager Suzie Dorner is on the frontlines of the pandemic.\\xa0', 'After performing her original poem, \u201cThe Hill We Climb,\" at President Joe Biden\\'s inauguration, Gorman became a viral sensation. On Sunday, she became the first-ever poet to recite a poem at the Super Bowl. Poetry does not typically spring to mind when thinking of a typical Super Bowl performance, but as the poet explained on \u201cThe Daily Show,\u201d \u201cThese are the moments I strive for in my lifetime, which is to bring poetry into places that we least expect it, so we can fully kind of grapple with the ways in which it can heal us and kind of resurrect us.\"', 'This ideal clearly resonates in her poem, as she describes the impact of COVID-19 and the sacrifices that have been made to survive this pandemic. Her words are particularly striking when she speaks of ICU nurse Suzie Dorner. \u201cHer chronicles prove that even in tragedy, hope is possible \/ She lost her grandmothers to the pandemic \/ And fights to save other lives in the ICU battle zone,\u201d Gorman said.\\xa0', 'Gorman\u2019s description of the pandemic as a battlefield reminds the listener that everyone must keep fighting even though people will face great sacrifice. The line also serves as a heavy reminder of the personal tragedies that have affected everyone during these times and praises the healthcare workers that have been at the forefront of this pandemic. Gorman places great responsibility and honor onto the listener by stating, \u201cLet us walk with these warriors, \/ Charge on with these champions \/ And carry forth the call of our captains \/ We celebrate them by acting \/ With courage and compassion.\u201d', 'The weight of these words is particularly relevant to the Super Bowl itself. Over 25,000 people attended the 2021 Super Bowl in person, even though the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and medical experts have advised people to stay home during the pandemic. While the NFL provided masks and hand sanitizer to all those in attendance, by the looks of panoramic photos, social distancing was not properly enforced and many in-person viewers did not wear their masks correctly. After the Buccaneers won, throngs of maskless fans flooded the streets and sports bars in Tampa \u2014 a city where hospitalizations for COVID-19 continue to climb and Suzie Dorner is working tirelessly on the frontlines.\\xa0', 'Surely, the irony of presenting Gorman\u2019s words honoring COVID heroes and encouraging the public to act with compassion during a possible superspreader event was not lost on the NFL and Super Bowl viewers. Gorman\u2019s poem provided a touching and much-needed reminder of how this pandemic has affected us and how it will continue to impact us if we do not act with humanity and kindness. Her desire to bring poetry to the Super Bowl will give viewers who are unfamiliar with her work a new consciousness of the world and the consequences of their actions. Hopefully, this act of listening and acting with empathy will indeed \u201cheal and resurrect us\u201d amid these difficult times.']","309":"['COVID-19 cases on Grounds jumped this week, with 40 student cases and four faculty and staff cases diagnosed Wednesday alone.

Nine NCAA Championship appearances, three tournament championships and five ACC Championships highlights the huge successes of the program. What Coach Julie Myers has done with the program after taking the reins from Jane Miller in 1996 has been nothing short of remarkable. In each of the 24 seasons with a postseason, Myers has guided her team to the NCAA Tournament where they earned 31 tournament wins \u2014 good for third all-time in tournament victories and games coached.', 'After enjoying a golden era from 2003-2007, where the Cavaliers made four national championship appearances, Virginia has yet to return to this level of accomplishment. While the Cavaliers have had successful regular seasons over the years, early round exits in the NCAA tournament have haunted them. The emergence of ACC foes such as North Carolina and Boston College and continued success of Maryland and Northwestern provides insight into the increasing number of championship caliber programs in women\u2019s lacrosse.', 'Reviewing last season', 'With a shorter season than usual, the Cavaliers only managed to play eight games and finish with a 5-3 record. Although that does not appear immediately impressive, Virginia showed plenty of promise to begin the season. The Cavaliers started 4-0 with wins over No. 15 Navy, No. 20 Stanford and No. 9 Princeton but stumbled on a mid-season hump and finished their last four games with a 1-3 record.', 'The Cavaliers had a diverse scoring attack, with five players scoring 12 or more goals in just eight games played. Senior midfielder Sammy Mueller led the way with 21 goals and seven assists, although Virginia will be forced to replace her talent after Mueller announced a graduate transfer to Northwestern.\\xa0', 'Defensively, the Cavaliers showed promise, although they struggled against top-tier opponents like North Carolina. Myers\u2019 defense allowed an average of 12 goals per game, which is good enough to allow the offense to put up big numbers. Senior goalkeeper Charlie Campbell played very well and will return to protect Virginia\u2019s backline.', 'Looking at the roster', 'Losing Mueller to the transfer portal certainly stung for Virginia fans, but the Cavaliers will surely not miss a beat in the scoring department in 2021. The return of several key veterans and the addition of a stellar recruiting class will provide Myers with a bevy of weapons and a balanced attack.\\xa0', 'On the front line, sophomore midfielder Ashlyn McGovern will join junior attacker Lillie Kloak to spearhead the offense. Since the start of the 2019 season, McGovern and Kloak have scored 42 and 45 goals, respectively \u2014\\xa0the two highest totals among active players on the team. Although the duo has shown the ability to score, their defensive efforts on the ride does not go unnoticed \u2014 McGovern especially, as\\xa0she won 15 ground balls and caused nine turnovers in the 2019 season.', 'Behind the attack unit, the Cavaliers midfield will look to provide balance, both offensively and defensively. Sophomore midfielder Courtlynne Caskin will look to build on her success last season when she scored 16 goals on just 29 shots, paired with five assists and 16 ground balls. Joining Caskin will be sophomore midfielder Annie Dyson, who has been terrific throughout time on the field \u2014\\xa0although she has dealt with a number of injuries in her career. While not the pure scorer that Caskin is, Dyson does a little bit of everything for the team \u2014 playing solid defense, picking up ground balls and also putting the ball in the back of the net when the opportunity presents itself.\\xa0', 'While Virginia\u2019s offense will be sure to put up big numbers, the most valuable piece of the team might be senior defender Meredith Chapman, who the Cavaliers landed via transfer from High Point. In her four years at High Point, Chapman was a huge piece of the Panthers\u2019 defense. Chapman started every game from 2017-2020 and played at a high level every time. In 2019, Chapman led High Point with 53 caused turnovers and 51 ground balls and was second on the team with 77 draw controls. Virginia has never been a defensive power under Myers, but with Chapman on board for the upcoming season, it finally has a chance to be lethal on both ends of the field.', 'While the returning veteran core will play a huge role in Virginia\u2019s success this season, a stellar recruiting class will be sure to supplement an already-loaded team. The Cavaliers will bring in five top-35 recruits according to Insider Lacrosse. Freshman attacker Morgan Schwab, who is the No. 12 recruit in the nation and No. 1 in Virginia\u2019s class, will join freshman midfielder Mackenzie Hoeg, No. 31 in the nation, on an already lethal defensive unit. Schwab and Hoeg, both of whom were 2019 U.S. All-Americans, may not contribute right away, but will provide the perfect compliment to Mcgovern and Kloak off the bench. Hoeg will also look to continue the line of successful lacrosse players in the family \u2014 her being the third to play lacrosse in the ACC. Myers\u2019 midfield will also receive a major boost, with five-star recruit freshman midfielder Margaret Bostain, freshman midfielder Aubrey Williams and freshman midfielder Devon Whitaker looking to bolster the unit. \\xa0', 'Key matchups', 'March 13th - Boston College', \"In the sixth game of the 2021 campaign, Virginia will receive its first test \u2014 and a major one at that. After spending years stuck in mediocrity, Boston College has become a perennial powerhouse in women\u2019s lacrosse under Coach Acacia Walker-Weinstein. The Golden Eagles\u2019 rise to the top has been swift, and they do not appear to be falling any time soon. After suffering three straight losses in the NCAA championship game from 2017-2019, Boston College is certainly hungry coming into this season. In those three seasons, Walker-Weinstein went 61-11 and put the entire NCAA on notice. During those three years, Virginia went 0-3 against Boston College \u2014 losing by an average 5.7 goals per game. Although they lost over half of their offensive production from the 2019 runner up team, the Golden Eagles have several veterans who will be catalysts this season. Senior attackers Cara Urbank and Charlotte North will look to return Boston College back to women's lacrosse\u2019s highest stage.\\xa0\", 'March 19th & 21st - Duke', 'Duke is not a powerhouse program like its ACC counterpart Boston College. In fact, Duke does not even have a national championship appearance to its name in the sport. However, the Virginia versus Duke showdown in women\u2019s lacrosse is one where anything can happen. Over the past 10 meetings between these programs, the series has been split, with both teams going 5-5 against one other. Duke is a good team that cannot be underestimated, and every year it seems that the energy is amped up for this matchup. The Cavaliers will host the double-header at home over a three-day span. The Blue Devils lost most of their offense from the 2019 campaign with the aforementioned North transferring to Boston College after tallying 82 goals. Senior midfielders Katie Cronin and Catriona Barry will be the offensive catalysts for a new-look Blue Devils team that will need young players to step up.\\xa0', 'March 26th - James Madison', 'James Madison is not a team that many think of when they think of women\u2019s lacrosse\u2019s elite, but the Dukes have enjoyed a great amount of success over recent years. Under Coach Shelley Klaes Bawcombe, James Madison reached its first national championship game in 2018 and defeated Boston College. Since then, they have gone 21-5 and have proven themselves to be a threat every year. However, despite how dominant the Dukes have been recently, they have not been able to clear the hump against Virginia, going 2-5 in their last seven meetings. The key pieces of the 2018 championship have left Harrisonburg, and the top three scorers from the 2019 team graduated, so there will be plenty of new faces that will have an opportunity to emerge. One player the Dukes should be excited about is redshirt freshman attacker Isabella Peterson, who had 15 goals in six games last season \u2014\\xa0her first. If she continues to develop and improves upon her great freshman season, she has the potential to lead the Dukes past Virginia and to the NCAA championship once again.\\xa0', 'April 16th and 18th - North Carolina', 'The second double-header of the season for Virginia will come on the road against ACC foe North Carolina. North Carolina was ranked No. 1 in the preseason coming into this year and is looking to revive a dynasty that appeared in three national championships from 2013-2016 and won two. The Tar Heels return their top three scorers from a year ago, headlined by senior attacker Katie Hoeg \u2014\\xa0the older sister of top-ranked recruit Mackenzie Hoeg and sophomore attacker Riley Hoeg of the Cavaliers. Hoeg will be flanked by senior attacker Jamie Ortega who had a stellar 2019 campaign where she scored 81 goals. The last time the Cavaliers beat the Tar Heels was 2010, when Virginia won in a double-overtime thriller. Since then, North Carolina has won 12 straight against the Cavaliers including the postseason. Poised to return to the NCAA championship, the Tar Heels certainly have what it takes this season and their matchup against the Cavaliers will be huge.', 'Virginia begins its climb back to the top Monday, Feb. 15 at Klockner Stadium against East Carolina.

Respect for our own health and the health of others mandates strict adherence to University COVID-19 guidelines. The limitations from the fall semester still exist \u2014 students must expect that they will miss out on experiences that they or other University students have enjoyed in past years. In light of the social oriented sacrifices students are making, professors should be empathetic toward student stress levels. Despite less formal breaks, professors must understand that students still need time to relax. One such opportunity that will require support from students and professors is the newly changed spring break schedule.\\xa0', 'Generally, spring break at the University is a weeklong reprieve from classes \u2014 this year\u2019s spring break, however, looks quite different. The typical week-long break has been replaced with multiple shorter break days. Despite the complications of this alteration, changing the structure of the traditional spring break was the safe decision. The University has a duty to reasonably restrict events that have the potential to increase the spread of COVID-19. While the University has done its part, students and professors still have a responsibility to respect the intentions of the spring break change. Students must avoid activities that would potentially spread COVID-19, and professors should organize their courses in a manner that genuinely allows students to have a break on these days.\\xa0', 'There are justifiable reasons for students to be dismayed at this scheduling change. Although the decision was clearly intended to help slow the spread of COVID-19, there are several unfortunate implications. The pandemic has resulted in increased stress for many students. However, the stress relief that comes from a weeklong break cannot compare to the relief associated with a day-long break. Students are clearly more stressed than in previous years with the numerous challenges presented by learning during a pandemic, yet they are provided less opportunities for much-needed rest. Regardless of this year\u2019s gathering limitations, the unfortunate schedule change will be in vain if students disregard the pandemic and spread COVID-19 while attempting to enjoy a more traditional spring break.', 'Before the pandemic, spring break was generally associated with travel and spending time with friends and family. With the new schedule, one of the new spring break days creates a three-day weekend. As such, I am particularly worried about students attempting activities on this weekend that were permissible in prior years \u2014 attending large gatherings or weekend long trips, for example. Although students should use their rest days to spend time with friends, they have a responsibility to not behave recklessly. Remember to follow the gathering size and travel expectations. The current gathering guidelines prohibit groups larger than six students and expect that all students remain at least six feet apart. In addition, students must understand that traveling in and of itself is a threat to the health of the University community. Unnecessary traveling during the pandemic is reckless. Last year, traveling during spring break led to spikes of COVID-19 on many college campuses. While we all want the pandemic to be over, ignoring COVID-19 will only exacerbate its consequences. Do not needlessly put the University and Charlottesville community at risk.\\xa0', 'On the other hand, professors must let this break remain a true break for students. In its essence, the reprise of spring break is intended to be a time for students to destress and relax with family and friends \u2014 the modified schedule should not change this goal. Especially with asynchronous classes, I worry that professors will continue to assign work during this period. I am also concerned that professors may schedule additional assignments during weeks where students have a break day, with the belief that students pick up the slack during their time off. While many students seem to agree that they would prefer a week long-break, even one day of rest can be beneficial. Professors must not take advantage of the altered schedule to assign additional work.\\xa0', 'I, along with many others, am personally disappointed that we will not be able to enjoy a weeklong spring break. However, I respect the decision of the University administration. They placed our best interests at the heart of this decision \u2014 valuing the mental and physical health of students. Nevertheless, sacrificing our week-long break is futile if students refuse to follow the clear expectations of the schedule change. However, any number of break days is worthless if professors refuse to acknowledge the very purpose for these days \u2014 to provide students a deserved rest from coursework stress. Reducing the risk of COVID-19 spreading while upholding spring break\u2019s aim to destress is only possible if all of us work together.\\xa0', 'Jessica Moore is an Opinion Columnist for The Cavalier Daily.

The ability to unilaterally wipe out loans \u2014 a federal expenditure costing billions of dollars \u2014 is not given to the President in the Constitution. Rather, Biden would be seizing this power from Congress in a brazen attempt to expand his own executive power. This would be an action for which there is no constitutional basis \u2014 creating one now would be problematic, as it would provide precedent for future presidents to expand their executive power even further. \\xa0', 'There has been a disturbing trend recently of presidents expanding their power through actions like these, in what has been termed by scholars as the imperial presidency. Even when done to accomplish effective policies \u2014 such as establishing DACA \u2014 executive actions bestow power on a president that cannot be taken away. That is power that can then be misused or directed to the national detriment, such as Executive Order 9066, which saw the mass internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II. Should President Biden invent the ability to unilaterally cancel billions of dollars in student debt, I worry what a future president with worse intentions would do with that newfound ability.\\xa0', 'At a time when our democracy has been tested and strained like never before, it is more important than ever that President Biden refrain from expanding the imperial presidency. So many of the abuses of office that have arisen in recent years are a product of Americans permitting the president to expand the presidential power because it was convenient at the moment \u2014 that trend must now stop. We cannot reach a point where presidents are able to rule by decree \u2014 when that happens, we will have elected a dictator. Congress needs to have a stronger voice in this debate. They must affirm their ability to govern on behalf of the people they represent.\\xa0', 'I know many progressives are frustrated with settling for policies that are not as bold, and perhaps less effective, when there are opportunities to go further \u2014 however, progress cannot be brought on at the expense of our democratic norms. I recognize that some will argue that now is the time for bold action, that people are suffering without this relief. This type of constitutional abuse will only antagonize Republicans at a time where we need political unity instead of the power-grabs that have become too common.\\xa0', 'Fortunately, President Biden has a unique opportunity to reinvigorate the legislative process by working with a Congress that has hopefully seen the consequences of its excesses, following the storming of our nation\u2019s Capitol last month. Now is the time for us to come together as Americans and do what we have always done \u2014 compromise. With a unified Democratic Congress, policies for student debt relief will be debated. While Congress may not choose to cancel $50,000 of debt for individuals, they can still make progress without further threatening our republic.\\xa0', 'Matt Heller is an Opinion Columnist for the Cavalier Daily.

Researchers at U.Va. Health working in the field of predictive analytics have created a software that uses artificial intelligence to estimate a patient\u2019s relative risk by combining physiological data from thousands of previous patients, with a current patient's physiological state. The software is crucial in allowing clinicians to assess a patient\u2019s risk for deterioration sooner than they normally would, allowing them to take \u2014 often critical \u2014 proactive actions towards maintaining the patient\u2019s health.\", 'Life-threatening conditions such as lung failure, sepsis or acute respiratory distress syndrome can all manifest in a patient without displaying warning signs to clinicians until the patient is in a critically debilitating condition. This can leave providers with limited time to make imperative decisions for patients and may thus threaten chances of survival.\\xa0', 'Dr. Randall Moorman, cardiologist and innovator in the field of predictive analytics monitoring, realized this healthcare dilemma early on in his career.', '\u201cSometimes \u2026 we can look back at the data that we had about those patients, and we can see that we should have seen it coming,\u201d Moorman said.', 'In attempts to better monitor patient stability through early detection, many hospitals around the world have resorted to using a standardized point system, which consists of recording certain physiological parameters and outputting a standardized score that can then be used to predict the patient\u2019s stability. For instance, in England the National Early Warning Score measures pulse rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, oxygen levels, temperature and consciousness level in patients, allocating an individual score for each factor and totaling the scores. When the total reaches a threshold number designated by healthcare facilities, it alerts clinicians to take action.\\xa0', 'However, Moorman found that such point systems were sometimes ineffective in monitoring the patient since they uniformly depended on the patient reaching a particular threshold score before clinicians were alerted. While threshold score monitoring may be helpful in some situations, these systems are not designed to indicate risk specific to each physiological factor, failing to utilize statistical tools like regression models, which use multiple variables to predict an outcome.\\xa0', '\u201cOne of the benefits of many machine learning approaches [is] you get a continuous gradation of risk from all the possible numbers that might come in, no thresholds [are] allowed,\u201d Moorman said.', 'Additionally, tools like NEWS can be restraining since they do not focus on symptoms specific to a certain patient population, like cardiac patients, but instead rely on a \u201cone size fits all\u201d model.\\xa0', '\u201cOur own point of view has been that this is not a one-size-fits-all problem at all, that the predictors of deterioration in one part of the hospital are going to be very different from elsewhere in the hospital,\u201d Moorman said.', 'Generalizing symptoms can lead to clinicians who depend on a standardized score when trying to predict any patient\u2019s disease progression, further leaving more room for ambiguity in executing care plans since the numbers are not always clearly indicative of a particular condition.', 'Approximately 20 years ago, Moorman decided to apply certain predictive concepts to proactively diagnose neonatal sepsis, which is a bacterial infection that occurs in the bloodstream of premature infants and can be deadly if not diagnosed early on. Sepsis has been particularly difficult for healthcare providers to diagnose since premature infants are unable to aptly communicate discomfort and are too fragile to have many diagnostic tests conducted on them.', 'Moorman analyzed data from several infants infected with sepsis and recognized distinct patterns in the heartbeat of infants that occurred before sepsis began. He then quantified the heart rate data for the heartbeat abnormality and created a software which would detect this abnormality and alert clinicians. The HeRO software, coupled with observations and skillset of clinicians, allowed for them to proactively integrate the software\u2019s findings into their care, culminating in a 20 percent decline in premature infant mortality as shown by a randomized trial.\\xa0', 'Consequently, Moorman expanded his work to create predictive models for adults, attempting to address a multitude of diseases using evidence from data coming from approximately 200,000 patients who have been admitted to U.Va. Health previously.', '\u201cWe present to the clinicians, not just the risk of sepsis, but we have developed predictive tools for early detection of other kinds of clinical deterioration like lung failure or bleeding or the need to be transferred to an ICU,\u201d Moorman said.', 'One of his primary goals is to use the benefits of Big Data analysis in predicting outcomes for future patients.\\xa0', \"\u201c[We are working] toward the idea of taking all of the data that comes out from a patient and analyzing it in such a way that we can tell the clinicians that someone's risk for something bad is going up,\u201d Moorman said.\", 'Contrary to standardizing softwares like NEWS, the Continuous Monitoring of Event Trajectories software relies on constant monitoring of the patient and previous data, working to apply algorithms which output the patient\u2019s status and risk of experiencing a serious event in the next 12 hours, updating every 15 minutes. CoMET updates models by calculating the cumulative contribution of physiological information from patients including data from their electronic medical records, EKG signals, vital signs and laboratory results.', 'The added machine learning approach allows for patients to be assessed relative to the outcomes from thousands of other patients and is more specific to the individual patient by displaying models specific to the patient\u2019s unit.\\xa0', '\u201cAt this point we have generated truly, hundreds of predictive models, depending on where you are in the hospital, what kind of things might go wrong and what information is available,\u201d Moorman said.', 'The \u201cPrediction Assistant\u201d screen uses regression to display patient risk by showing \u201ccomets\u201d for each patient being monitored in the unit, with more stable patients represented as small and close to the bottom of the graph, while patients at higher risk are represented by larger and brighter comets. Each of the comets are graphed as a measure of a combination of factors most relevant to the hospital unit.', 'University cardiologist Jamieson Bourque, in collaboration with Jessica Keim-Malpass, associate professor of nursing and pediatrics, have recently begun a two-year randomized controlled study of the CoMET software in patients in the medical-surgical floor for cardiology and cardiovascular surgery patients at the U.Va. Hospital. They intend to analyze the long term outcomes of patients and prove the software\u2019s utility to help patients through providing clinicians with valuable predictive models from physiological data.', '\u201cWhat CoMET does is allows you to see the small incremental changes in heart rate, respiratory rate, vital signs [and] labs that can sort of fly under the radar, but when all those values are added together, that may signify a more significant change,\u201d Bourque said.', 'The team is also in the process of developing a predictive model specifically for COVID-19. However, it is waiting to gain more data to better understand the unpredictable nature of the disease so is currently using pre-existing models for the respiratory distress that accompanies COVID-19. The researchers feel that a predictive model could potentially be largely beneficial to dealing with COVID-19 patients since it could help anticipate some of the unpredictable symptoms which have shown to cause mortality.', '\u201cAt unexpected times, a fair number of patients do deteriorate drastically, and then there are very big decisions to be made in this time of constrained resources or this time of full hospitals,\u201d Moorman said.', 'Main challenges researchers face with integrating CoMET involve educating clinicians on reading the patterns as well as helping them integrate the software\u2019s usage into their daily workflow. With CoMET, clinicians are suggested to utilize the proactive warning signs and learn to construct a care plan sooner than they normally would.', 'Keim-Malpass, who is also trained as a nurse, is able to incorporate her first-hand perspective to CoMET\u2019s design by attempting to ensure that nurses and other clinicians in the hospital can adapt their responsibilities to the proactive nature of the software. She spoke of a time when nurses recognized a spike in the patient\u2019s CoMET score trajectory that allowed them to prevent sepsis when the patient was still stable.\\xa0', '\u201cThey went ahead and preemptively took blood cultures, and a few hours later they came back positive that they had blood infection, that they were heading towards sepsis, so that patient got antibiotics sooner [than] they would have,\u201d Keim-Malpass said.', 'In the future, the team plans to use more data to enhance the COVID-19 model and to implement CoMET to other hospitals around the nation.', 'Conflict of interest disclosure: Randall Moorman is Chief Medical Officer and owns equity in AMP3D, which licenses technology from UVALVG and markets the CoMET monitor.']","320":"['As January closes and February is underway, we\u2019re another month to the already thirteen-ish months of living through a global pandemic.

The electoral triumph cemented Georgia\u2019s status as a true battleground state, as it is no longer a Republican stronghold. These elections were historic, as Sen. Raphael Warnock became the first Black senator to represent Georgia and Sen. Jon Ossoff the first Jewish American senator from Georgia.', 'Since Georgia has remained a red state for much of its recent history, it was a shock to many to see this state flip blue. This sentiment, however, is unfounded. Due to a variety of factors, the overarching Democratic victory in Georgia should not be a surprise at all.\\xa0', 'First and foremost, the most important reason that the results in Georgia were not a surprise is that more people registered to vote and casted votes . While some Republicans across the country continue to spew the unfounded theories of mass voter fraud in Georgia, the reality is that people like Stacey Abrams, Nse Ufot and Tamieka Atkins found ways to overcome the generations of voter suppression in the state. Through grassroots tactics \u2014 \\xa0like large voter registration drives and knocking on doors to engage with low-propensity voters \u2014 that were enacted by these extraordinary Black women and the Black communities in Georgia, \\xa0it is clear that communities of color turned Georgia blue. \\xa0\\xa0Around 70,000 voters were newly registered for this runoff election alone \u2014 of these, those under 30 and non-white citizens, in particular, constituted a large portion. Additionally, Black women were an incredibly influential voting bloc for the Democratic party \u2014 91 percent of Black women voted for Joe Biden. Simply put, the people that have been disenfranchised in Georgia for generations finally had their voices heard, and it was these votes that swayed this election. When more of the electorate is given a voice \u2014 particularly when those voters are historically oppressed and hold opposing political views from those oppressors \u2014 it should come as no surprise that the outcome of an election can flip, in this case helping Democrats to secure control of both the White House and Senate.\\xa0', 'Furthermore, the demographics of the Georgia electorate are becoming younger and more diverse, which is incredibly important to the Democratic Party. A population that has more young or diverse citizens typically leans Democratic. Additionally, not only are the young people of Georgia growing up to be Democrats or left-leaning voters, but many Democratic voters have also been moving into the cities of Georgia. Over the past four years, Georgia has seen an influx of liberal-leaning voters in its cities, from Atlanta to Savannah. \\xa0And finally, the generation that has kept Georgia conservative over the past several decades is getting a lot older. Therefore, as citizens age or pass away, they are essentially replaced by a younger, more diverse and progressive section of the electorate.', 'Although Georgia still remains an undeniably Southern state, this key factor distances it from its other \u201cDeep South\u201d counterparts when it comes to elections. While democrats Jaime Harrison of South Carolina and Doug Jones of Alabama were both excellent senatorial candidates, those states simply have not seen nearly the same demographic changes that have taken place in Georgia over recent years.\\xa0', 'Finally, it is important to note that the variety of options to submit a ballot in light of COVID-19 led to a less surprising Democratic victory. The use of absentee ballots in Georgia was a game-changer for a variety of reasons. First, Georgia, unlike several other states, has not passed any legislation making election day a state holiday \u2014 thus people do not get time off of work to go vote. Furthermore, among the times that polls close across the states, Georgia maintains a very early closing time. In fact, Georgia is one of the only eight states that closes its polls at or before 7 p.m. Consequently, this does not leave enough time for citizens that get off of work at around 5 p.m. to then wait in line to cast their votes. All of these issues, however, were fixed with the relaxation of absentee ballot guidelines, which made civic engagement far easier this election cycle than in years past.', 'Ultimately, from changing demographics, to the record-breaking entrance of newly registered voters and the ability for more citizens to vote than ever before, the Democratic victory in Georgia should not be seen as a surprise. Rather, it should be viewed as a hard-earned outcome by the Black organizers and voters of Georgia and a blueprint for Democrats going forward. \\xa0', 'Evelyn Duross is a Viewpoint Writer for The Cavalier Daily.

Black represents the darker times in their relationship \u2014 drug abuse, stealing, cheating \u2014 while white represents the brighter times \u2014 getting sober, working on Malcolm\u2019s scripts together, being intimate. We learn about the ups and downs of their relationship simultaneously. So not only is the film black and white, but the dialogue itself is black and white.\\xa0', 'The set design of \u201cMalcolm & Marie\u201d is also a highlight. In the story, Malcolm and Marie are confined to a large but mostly empty rental home that the studio made them stay in while his film was being made. Taking place entirely within this house, \u201cMalcolm & Marie\u201d is cut so the audience never knows the exact layout. This makes the house feel like a giant maze, which is reflective of Malcolm and Marie\u2019s tumultuous relationship \u2013\u2013 something big enough for the characters to get lost in, yet they still feel lonely.', 'Washington and Zendaya deliver great performances. Both convey the dialogue excellently, making the audience feel like they are in the house with Malcolm and Marie \u2014 giving viewers an experience similar to watching a play. Zendaya brings a better performance, but that\u2019s mostly due to the failings of the screenplay. She plays Marie excellently, pouring out emotion whenever she is on the screen.\\xa0', 'Washington is different. Many of the emotionally abusive things Malcolm says to Marie are executed very well. The audience can feel the pain when Malcolm mentions Marie\u2019s suicide attempt or that he could \u201csnap her like a twig.\u201d The real downfall of his performance are his ongoing monologues.\\xa0', 'Whether Malcolm is complaining about reviews for his films or that all art made by Black people is not political, he meanders. This is partially because of the script, but it\u2019s also on Washington for not changing his cadence or his attitude. Malcolm does this quite a few times, making much of the film feel stale and uninteresting.', 'It is vital to mention the worst part of the film \u2013\u2013 the script. A lot of red herrings are thrown into the plot, and it weakens the film. Malcolm\u2019s disdain for film critics, how society interprets art, what authenticity really means \u2014 these are interesting ideas, but the script doesn\u2019t do a good job of explaining how they connect to the overall plot.', 'Many of these topics are close to the hearts of artists, so it feels like Levinson is venting through Malcolm \u2014 especially since the script fails to reveal why these topics are necessary to the story. On the other hand, the film is at its best when focusing on Malcolm and Marie\u2019s relationship. Therefore, when it side-steps that plotline to focus on other topics, the film becomes confusing.\\xa0', 'The ending is a great example of this. Malcolm and Marie spend most of the movie arguing inside the house and then eventually fall asleep. In the morning, Malcolm wakes up alone, scrambling to find Marie. He finds her outside, then the screen fades to black. The credits roll while playing \u201cLiberation\u201d by OutKast and CeeLo Green.\\xa0', 'It\u2019s an interesting conclusion, but the audience is left asking, \u201cLiberation from what?\u201d Is Marie liberated from Malcolm? Are Malcolm and Marie liberated from their past demons? Is the film industry liberated from white supremacy and patriarchy? Are filmmakers liberated from the idea of authenticity?\\xa0', 'The audience doesn\u2019t know, and the film doesn\u2019t either. Leaving the film inconclusive and with something to talk about is nice, but if you bring in a smorgasbord of ideas with no real focus or new ideas, it leaves the audience feeling empty.', 'Unfortunately, this film goes for style over substance \u2014 focusing more on what it looks like than how it makes people feel. Definitely don\u2019t watch this for Valentine\u2019s Day with your boo. It\u2019ll ruin the night. But if you want to see something pretty with great performances despite a subpar screenplay, turn on \u201cMalcolm & Marie.\u201d']","325":"['1.

An online class is much different from an in-person one, but most of the time the stress we experience exists because of our unfamiliarity with a new process. Next time you open up a syllabus for an online course, take a deep breath and relax because nine times out of 10 that class won\u2019t be as bad as you think.\\xa0', '2.

Little things like this that factor into online classes \u2014 such as structure, format, teaching style and material \u2014 make the process of choosing virtual classes stressful.

It is important to make a schedule \u2014 especially if you have asynchronous classes', 'When I first began online classes, I had a mix of both asynchronous and synchronous courses. Since my asynchronous classes didn\u2019t meet at a designated time each day, I found myself struggling to keep up with the material and stay organized. As the semester progressed, I decided that I needed to integrate these classes into a fixed schedule and set a designated time each week to watch and review the lectures. Ultimately, this technique helped me feel less overwhelmed and more in-tune with my lectures. If you feel that you\u2019re scrambling at the last minute to watch your lectures, I encourage you to make your own schedule in order to help you stay organized and ease the stress of keeping up with asynchronous classes.', '4.

When I began, I always felt like I was missing a deadline for an assignment, so I was constantly checking Collab throughout the day. As I got more in the groove of online classes, I realized that taking breaks throughout the day increased my level of focus towards my school work. So, if you find yourself having free time during your day, I recommend taking intentional breaks that give you the time to decompress.

Get up and find a new spot to start off your classes \u2014 you may find you really enjoy it! \\xa0', '7. Social interaction is important', 'Nowadays, we spend so much time cooped up on our computers with social interactions limited to the online world. As a social butterfly, I felt my lack of in-person social interaction weighing on my mental health. I missed seeing people in and outside of class, and this pushed me to be more intentional about interacting with others. Whether it\u2019s doing a fun activity with roommates, going to lunch with one of your friends or calling that special someone in your life, these small moments with others are so important to our life experience and happiness.\\xa0', '8.

Although it is hard to adopt a positive mindset during these times, it is necessary to do so in order to foster positivity.

These authorizations came after months of phase 3 clinical trials with a diverse group of participants \u2014 Pfizer enrolled 43,448 participants in their trial while Moderna enrolled 30,000 participants. These vaccines will play a critical role in ending the pandemic and allow life to regain a sense of normalcy.', 'William Petri, chief of the Division of Infectious Diseases and International Health at U.Va., notes that the vaccine trials were conducted with a broad range of test subjects, giving scientists greater reassurance about the trials\u2019 positive results.\\xa0', '\u201cThey made a pretty good attempt to include a fair representation of people with underlying medical illnesses, the elderly, the African-American and Latinx communities,\u201d Petri said. \u201cThese vaccines are amazingly effective, and they are effective in people with underlying illnesses and in the elderly, which is, of course, who we want to protect the most.\u201d\\xa0', 'According to the Virginia Department of Health, 1,156,117 total COVID-19 vaccine doses have been administered in Virginia. Approximately 10 percent of the state\u2019s population has received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, and an average of 33,520 doses are administered each day. In Virginia, populations 70 years or older make up 27 percent of those who have received one dose of the vaccine. Additionally, of the 66 percent of vaccinations that report the race or ethnicity of the recipient, 28 percent have gone to people of color.\\xa0', 'The CDC stated that the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is 95 percent effective in preventing symptomatic infection in individuals ages 16 years and older while the Moderna vaccine is 94.1 percent effective for individuals ages 18 years and older.

It is this help in antibody production that makes these vaccines so effective.\u201d', 'Both the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines use messenger RNA, known as mRNA, a genetic element naturally present in the human body. Dr. Costi Sifri, director of hospital epidemiology at the University, explained that mRNA provides a template for making proteins. Once injected into the body, the mRNA instructs cells to create spike, or S, glycoproteins. Then, the body detects the synthesized proteins and creates an immune response against them.', '\u201cThis protein itself is a part of SARS-CoV-2,\u201d Sifri said. \u201cThat\u2019s the Achilles\u2019 heel. It\u2019s a key component used by the virus to cause disease \u2026 and the central target for all vaccines that are currently being either used or in the late stages of development.\u201d\\xa0', 'Sifri further explained that S glycoproteins are an essential part of SARS-CoV-2 because they allow the virus to attach itself to healthy cells. Allowing the body to prepare an immune response against the S glycoproteins prior to SARS-CoV-2 infection largely prevents future symptomatic infection.', \"\u201cBy developing an immune response to this key protein \u2026 you've allowed the body to learn how to protect itself from the virus,\u201d Sifri said.\\xa0\", 'While it is still largely unknown how long the vaccines protect against symptomatic infection of SARS-CoV-2 \u2014 partially as a result of insufficient data thus far \u2014 both Petri and Sifri are hopeful that it will be long lasting.

When comparing those who received the vaccine to those in the placebo group, there were fewer asymptomatic infections among the vaccine group. However, further data is needed to confirm any hypothesis.', 'Because asymptomatic transmission is still a possibility, Armstrong recommends continuing to practice COVID-19 safety precautions, including social distancing and handwashing, even after vaccination.\\xa0', 'While these vaccines are nothing short of revolutionary, challenges have plagued their distribution. For instance, both vaccines must be stored at ultra-cold temperatures, and some facilities, especially in rural areas, do not have the resources to store them.\\xa0', \"\u201cThe Pfizer vaccine requires a deep freezer,\u201d Sifri said. \u201cThey're shipped on dry ice and they're stored in these deep freezers that have a temperature of -70 to -80 degrees Celsius. In contrast, the Moderna vaccine is manufactured and stored in -20 degrees Celsius.\u201d\", 'Armstrong explained another challenge facing vaccine distribution \u2014 some people are not comfortable receiving these vaccines. She suspected that the name of the U.S. government initiative to develop COVID-19 vaccines, Operation Warp Speed, misled the public to believe vaccines were developed too quickly and without proper testing and precautions.\\xa0', \"\u201cThat isn\u2019t true \u2014\\xa0what Operation Warp Speed essentially did was it allowed the federal government to pour billions of dollars into this effort, allowing the process to move along more quickly,\u201d Armstrong said. \u201cWe try and encourage and reassure people that all the safety checks have been done \u2026 that the trials have enrolled and tested the usual number of patients and that there's been no cutting corners.\u201d\", 'In order to receive FDA approval, both the Moderna and Pfizer had to meet the strict standards laid out in the FDA\u2019s Development and Licensure of Vaccines to Prevent COVID-19 guidelines. These included randomization of vaccine distribution, follow-up studies on participants and close tracking of any adverse effects after vaccination, among others.', 'Armstrong also discussed the rise of SARS-CoV-2 variants, including the British and South African variants. Another variant has also recently been identified in Brazil. There are two reported cases of the United Kingdom variant in Virginia as of Jan. 31.', 'The CDC states that these variants are more transmissible and can spread more quickly, increasing the amount of COVID-19 cases. Armstrong explained that while both the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccine are effective against the British variant, both vaccines provide slightly less protection against the South African variant. To combat new strains of the virus, both Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna plan to develop additional booster shots for better protection.', 'Armstrong stressed the importance of getting vaccinated, especially with the recent emergence of new variants. \\xa0', \"\u201cI believe it's really, really important to get vaccinated, and I think until we have a mostly vaccinated population, we're going to be struggling with coronavirus for a long time,\u201d Armstrong said.\"]","331":"['In the two months that students were away from Grounds over winter break, the COVID-19 pandemic took a sharp new turn. Not only did the number of cases shoot up \u2014 both nationally and in the Blue Ridge Health District \u2014 but the very nature of the virus itself also changed with a more-contagious variant expected to become the dominant strain in the country by March. Despite this, a series of recent incidents suggests that students are not being any safer this semester \u2014 a period traditionally characterized by large social gatherings, sporting events, fraternity and sorority rush. Students have continued to display a lack of empathy towards those around them and a total disregard for all University-implemented policies intended to slow the spread of the virus.\\xa0', 'We are nearly a year into the pandemic \u2014 students know what it takes to behave responsibly and protect those around them. At this point, those who continue to party and gather in large crowds are willfully ignorant, putting both the University and Charlottesville communities in danger. This past weekend, it was abundantly clear that many students blatantly disregarded COVID-19 guidelines, gathering in large groups for events like IFC rush and the Super Bowl. Scenes of maskless students drinking together on Mad Bowl or at Corner bars and pelting snowballs at each other on the Lawn have littered social media feeds, showing the incredible lack of concern these students display towards the virus. In addition, community members voiced their concerns on social media platforms with University students entering local communities without masks, jeopardizing the health of the predominantly Black population. Students who continue such recklessness during the current semester display a shameful disregard for the human lives very much at risk with their actions.\\xa0', 'Indeed, college campuses often provide perhaps the best breeding ground for viruses like COVID-19. A single positive case on a residential hall has the potential to infect dozens, with residents not only living in close proximity to each other but also sharing restrooms, study lounges, washing machines and even breathing the same filtered air. Little over a week into the semester, the University identified 17 cases in Gibbons residence hall. Similar conditions apply to off-Grounds houses and apartments as well. If students are cautious, dorms may not necessarily have to foster massive COVID-19 outbreaks. However, when students disregard the policies put in place to protect them, there is a large chance that residence halls will see these large outbreaks. Simply put, the actions of a single individual can have a very real and tangible impact on the community as a whole. The consequences of rash student actions also extend well beyond Grounds. Both nationwide and in the Charlottesville community, Black and Brown people are much more susceptible to COVID-19 complications.\\xa0', 'The University itself certainly has a responsibility to look out for the well-being of the Charlottesville community. Doctors, nurses and volunteers from the health system have conducted thousands of free drive-in tests for members of the community. This is certainly a step in the right direction, but there always remains more that the University can do. When the pandemic first began, for example, the University was incredibly strict on gatherings at Mad Bowl or the Lawn \u2014 even shutting down Mad Bowl for some time. As time progressed, the University eased up on some of these restrictions, which is why students were able to congregate in such a manner this past weekend. Now, as students have shown that they simply do not care about the policies the University has put in place, the University has rightfully recommitted to these strict but necessary precautions indefinitely. They must temporarily shut down Mad Bowl \u2014 which is known for its large gatherings of drunk students \u2014 and enforce the extended six-person gathering limit.\\xa0', 'Neither the University administration nor the student body can be entirely effective acting as independent bodies \u2014 they must band together to combat the virus. Although the University must institute policies to ensure our safety and the safety of those around us, it is ultimately up to students to respect the clear directives and intentions of those policies \u2014 stop looking for loopholes. It is clear that the behavior of these ignorant and selfish students will have incredibly dangerous consequences for those in the University community and in Charlottesville. For those who continue to break COVID-19 policies \u2014 even if you refuse to acknowledge the implications of your behavior, hope that your own actions don\u2019t catch up and leave you suspended or with major health concerns. Know that your actions could have already caused irreparable harm for surrounding communities.

Unsurprisingly, the nation was shocked and horrified at this attempted insurrection \u2014 one driven by a sitting president\u2019s support.', 'I won\u2019t splice words \u2014 Donald Trump and the Republican Party are responsible for the attack. Aside from the speech he gave to these terrorists that morning, Trump has touted prejudice throughout his entire presidency and political career. The people who voted for him in 2016 and 2020 did not vote for him because they believed he wasn\u2019t racist \u2014 they voted for him because he upholds his promise of maintaining the status quo in America, a nation built on the very expression of racism through colonialism, genocide and slavery. There is no argument to be had around Trump anymore. Those who still support him are bigoted without question.', 'However, as more and more Republicans jump the Trump ship, we cannot let them off the hook. The official Republican Party platform expresses \u201cunanimous\u201d and \u201centhusiastic\u201d support for the man who caused the Capitol riots \u2014 to name one event that has weighed on our minds recently. Beyond that, though, exists the GOP\u2019s support of education and healthcare that opposes and denies queer families, its opposition to single-parent families, its viewpoint of family life as existing only in a monotheistic context and its belief that welfare money spent on any family that falls outside of its strict definition signals a societal failure. All of these policies appear on page 31 of the official platform \u2014 one page of a 67-page document.', \"Notably, on page 39, the platform calls for higher police enforcement against \u201crioters'' and \u201cmob attacks.\u201d Yet Senator Josh Hawley, R-Mo., raised his fist in solidarity as he walked past the crowd of terrorists who would later breach the very chamber Hawley works in. It appears that American conservatism only opposes those who protest against its own policies.

We\u2019re taught in elementary school to put faith in the Founding Fathers, but it\u2019s no coincidence that modern America looks up to slaveholders. The principles that upheld slavery never disappeared, as evident in the white supremacists who have embraced Trumpism and the white liberalism \u2014 evident in those who vocalize their white guilt over the voices of Black and Brown people who have actually faced racism \u2014 growing on the left.', 'After Kentucky Senator Mitch McConnell \u2014 arguably America\u2019s most powerful Republican \u2014 \\xa0rebuked Trump on the Senate floor, Biden expressed \u201cpride\u201d in McConnell.

His last-second change of heart \u2014 only one of many Republicans to have one \u2014 isn\u2019t defending democracy. It\u2019s Republicans\u2019 attempt to separate themselves from anarchy. I do not share Biden\u2019s pride \u2014 Americans must see through conservative attempts at whitewashing their support of Trump\u2019s bigotry.', 'While I may begrudgingly vote Democrat in a system that allots us only two real choices, I can say with full certainty that I will never give ultraconservatives the kind of attention that normalizes their brash bigotry. Truthfully, the Democratic Party and the physical Capitol Building itself aren\u2019t all that different. When your privilege gives you no personal investment in either entity\u2019s actions, it\u2019s easy to construct them as pillars of democracy. You know that, for you, those pillars will never crumble. Yet millions of underprivileged Americans have sat in their rubble for centuries.', 'Our focus as a nation, particularly amongst liberals, must now shift from giving attention to conservatism to holding liberalism accountable.

As Bryce Wyles\u2019 recent column indicates, there is an increasingly common willingness to strip basic civil liberties in the name of social justice, as well as a troubling lack of understanding of the First Amendment, what it exists to protect and the inherent societal value of free speech. There is deep irony to Wyles\u2019 statement that \u201cpeople will often assume their freedom of speech means they can deny others\u2019 right to speech \u2026 that is simply unconstitutional.\u201d This statement is nonsensical \u2014 not only because nowhere on the list of non-first amendment protected speech is anything resembling silencing others, but also because the hateful speech Wyles describes does nothing to prevent anyone from speaking out against it. Most of all, Wyles\u2019 article shows a disturbing disregard for freedom of speech. It indicates a belief that only those who wish to express reasonable \u2014 or even only progressive \u2014 speech deserve free expression.', 'The First Amendment protects racist speech, bigoted speech and other hate speech. However, this is not a flaw in our free-speech laws but a deep strength. Like Wyles, I am disgusted by the University\u2019s chapter of the Young America\u2019s Foundation\u2019s hateful actions. However, what makes the First Amendment so powerful is that it does not exist to make me comfortable. It does not exist to protect reasonable opinions, good ideas and productive discourse. It exists to protect the repugnant, the controversial and the provocative. A world without the freedom to say controversial things \u2014 even objectively terrible things \u2014 is a world without free expression. Without free expression, there can be no civil liberties.', 'Further, U.Va. is a public university and is thus legally bound to uphold the First Amendment. It both cannot and should not silence any First Amendment protected speech, which ultimately includes all hate speech that does not become harassment, libel or any other non-protected speech act. However, Wyles\u2019 column reveals a greater problem than ignorance about the First Amendment. The complete willingness to disregard basic liberties in the name of social justice is an increasingly common trend in college leftism. Ultimately, this trend will work to the detriment of liberal thought and erode leftist commitment to liberal values.', 'As a liberal, I am increasingly troubled by the distinctly authoritarian streak in modern leftism. \\xa0While I wholeheartedly agree with the leftist cause of economic and racial justice, the increasingly authoritarian, anti-free speech rhetoric used by leftists is deeply harmful to the progressive cause. Over the past few years, I have seen words like free speech and liberty become dirty words in liberal spaces \u2014 this deeply disturbs me. To abandon a commitment to essential civil liberties \u2014 yes, even for those with whom you disagree radically \u2014 is to abandon what liberalism fundamentally stands for in favor of destructive dogmatism. I align with the political left because I deeply believe in the value of a free and open society. This is something that can only be gained when all are able to express their beliefs, and where ideological disagreements are solved in the public forum of debate, discourse and protest. When someone says something repugnant, the solution is not to silence them but to use your rights to vocally and intensely disagree.', 'If an appeal to the inherent value of civil liberties isn\u2019t convincing, then consider a more pragmatic perspective. If your goal is to change minds and hearts, advocating for the censorship of those you dislike isn\u2019t going to change anything. In fact, it makes leftists appear volatile, dogmatic and anything but progressive. Public disagreement gives liberals an opportunity to share their best ideas and to actually present compelling arguments for joining the cause. Censorship is lazy and ultimately ineffective.', 'I believe in the liberal cause and the importance of leftist activism and advocacy for the kinds of radical change needed in our nation. I, too, am enraged by the kinds of hateful, indisputably racist language groups like YAF deploy. However, for all my disagreement, I could not in good conscience wish for their silencing. Instead, I use my own free expression to state deep disgust at their speech, while remaining deeply committed to their right to say it. Authoritarianism is becoming increasingly popular on both sides of the aisle and to devastating effect. If progressivism is to remain a powerful force, and frankly \u2014 to state a deeper fear of mine \u2014 if a commitment to liberty is to remain valuable in this nation, leftists must abandon authoritarian sympathies.

Ranked No. 55 in her recruiting class, as well as top 10 in her position, Boggs is a very talented roster piece for Virginia this upcoming season. A multi-sport athlete, Boggs has the athletic ability to make game-changing plays. Also in her personal arsenal is an elite hitting ability which she showcased throughout highschool en route to being named conference player of the year. Her talents make her a weapon on both the offensive and defensive side of the field.', 'While not ranked in the top 100 recruits, freshman pitcher Mikayla Houge still played in three state championships and was named the Iowa Gatorade Player of the Year in 2019. Her pitching abilities led her to secure over 1,000 high school career strikeouts, showing off her elite talent and longevity.

Many of the conference teams Virginia will face this year fared very well in the shortened 2020 season, making the road to success even more difficult.

The ACC conference is particularly strong this year, with six teams \u2014 Louisville, Florida State, Miami, Duke, Georgia Tech and Wake Forest \u2014 ranked in either the Baseball America or D1Baseball preseason polls. The Cavaliers, meanwhile, enter the season as the No. 5 team in the country, with a number of key players returning to the roster in 2021.\\xa0\", 'Before the 2020 season was cut short due to COVID-19, Virginia was well on its way to an explosive spring performance. The Cavaliers were 14-4 and opened ACC play with a series of wins against then-No. 7 NC State, handing the Wolfpack their first losses of the season. In the short spring campaign, Virginia proved its talent at the plate, ranking seventh in the nation in scoring, 10th in home runs and 11th in on-base percentage. And while the Cavaliers struggled on the mound in 2018 and 2019, the pitching staff put on strong performances in 2020, ranking 69th nationally with a 3.39 ERA. Virginia returns to the diamond this spring bolstered by players granted an additional year of eligibility by the NCAA, as well as a class of 11 new players with impressive accolades. With a deep roster, the Cavaliers set their sights on their first tournament berth since 2017.\\xa0', 'Key matchup', 'No. 6 Louisville, April 16-18', 'Ranked sixth in the preseason USA Today Sports coaches poll, the Cardinals may pose the largest threat to Virginia. Last year, the Cardinals were ranked No. 1 in the country heading into the season after the team traveled to Ohama for the College World Series semifinals in 2019. Like Virginia, Louisville will benefit from the NCAA decision to grant players an additional year of eligibility. Although the Cardinals lost a pair of first-round picks, several players return this season for another chance at a national title. All but two pitchers will be back in rotation this spring, including junior left-hander Michael Kirian, who recorded a 0.00 ERA and six saves in 2020, as well as an impressive 11-1 strikeout to walk ratio in the shortened season. Also coming out of the bullpen is junior right-hander Glenn Albanese, a strong, powerful pitcher who has worked his way back following Tommy John surgery in 2018. This fall he consistently hit the mid-90s with his fastball, comfortably finding the zone and mixing in a changeup. At the same time, the Cardinals have a powerhouse lineup stacked with hard-hitters from top to bottom. Junior infielder Lucas Dunn, for example, batted over .300 in his first two seasons at Louisville, earning a spot on Team USA in 2019. Similarly, junior outfielder Luke Brown will likely start in center field this season after batting .328 in 2020 and leading the team with 11 steals as a junior college transfer. The Cavaliers will need a strong bullpen to control the Cardinals at the plate, find an offensive spark early on in the game and carry that momentum through the late innings to emerge victorious. As both teams have a powerhouse batting lineup, the bullpen may also need to rely on its depth to play through a high-scoring matchup.', 'Player to watch', 'Zack Gelof', 'Although he missed playing time during the fall due to injury, junior third-baseman Zack Gelof was a major contributor in the Cavalier lineup in 2020. The right-hander heralded an impressive .349 batting average that included six doubles, two triples, five home runs and 18 RBI. Gelof also led the ACC with 47 total bases, a .746 slugging percentage and 24 runs scored. The third-baseman has taken control of the hot corner for Virginia, starting every game during his freshman and sophomore seasons. In 2020 Gelof was named the third-best third-baseman in D1Baseball\u2019s Top 30 Power Rankings, and this season he is a First Team Preseason All-American selection by Collegiate Baseball Newspaper. Returning as a junior, Gelof will be at the top of his game as a power hitter and strong force on the corner of the diamond. As the Cavaliers face top-ranked teams, including a set of competitive ACC rivals, Gelof is poised for another great season \u2014 perhaps his best yet.\\xa0', 'Key to the season', 'Bringing the heat', 'Virginia\u2019s success will rely on its strength on the mound as it works through a difficult schedule. Senior left-hander Andrew Abbott is catching fire and will be a major weapon this spring, returning for another year after going undrafted in 2020. The lefty was ranked No. 7 last season in D1Baseball\u2019s Top 50 relief pitchers in college baseball. With a 1.35 ERA, Abbott was the fifth-lowest among ACC relievers with 10 or more innings pitched, striking out 21 batters and allowing just two runs in 13.1 innings. In the fall, however, Abbott transitioned into a starter for the Cavaliers. A killer curveball and highly effective changeup will serve him well as he enters the season ranked No. 64 on the NCAA\u2019s Top 150 college prospects.\\xa0', '\u201cHe\u2019s still a high fastball guy, uses that with the breaking ball, but for him to start, he was going to have to learn how to be more efficient, and come to use that changeup more often,\u201d Coach Brian O\u2019Connor said in a statement to NCAA News. \u201cSo I\u2019m excited where he\u2019s at; obviously he has more experience than anybody on our pitching staff. I feel like he\u2019s got an edge to him, got something to prove. So I do envision him starting.\u201d', 'While Gelof and Abbott are two names to look out for as the season gets underway, a number of other Cavaliers are sure to impress in 2021. Graduate student catcher Logan Michaels is a veteran behind the plate with the experience necessary to handle the pitching staff \u2014 producing pop times around 2.00 seconds this fall with spot-on accuracy \u2014 and batted .311 in 2019 and .316 in 2020. Sophomore outfielder Chris Newell is a rising star in the outfield and brings power at the plate, recording four homers, 20 RBI and eight steals last spring. And junior infielder Nic Kent, who will compete with sophomore infielder Max Cotier for the starting shortstop position, has the instincts to lead Virginia defensively and is a strong presence at the plate. With all the returning talent, the 11 newcomers will need to step up and prove themselves to get playing time this spring. True freshman Channing Austin may make his way into the rotation as he narrows his focus to pitching, touting a promising slider and working up his speed. Freshman Kyle Teel was named the 2020 New Jersey Gatorade Player of the Year before making his way to Virginia, and freshman Jake Gelof may also see playing time as he joins his older brother on the diamond. \\xa0', 'The Cavaliers are scheduled to open the season on their home field at Disharoon Park on Friday against the University of Connecticut.

The talk centered around current race relations in America, and Glaude drew quotes from poet and activist James Baldwin \u2014 which were written over three decades ago \u2014 to reflect the pervasiveness of white supremacy and racism in America.\\xa0', 'Kevin McDonald, vice president for Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Community Partnerships, began the event by acknowledging the thousands of enslaved laborers who built and worked at the University in the mid-19th century before introducing the event\u2019s moderator \u2014 Kwame Otu, assistant professor of African American and African Studies at the University.', 'Glaude began with a quote from Ralph Waldo Emerson to reflect on the current time we\u2019re in.', \"\u201cI'm reminded of Ralph Waldo Emerson in 1844 and where he wrote \u2026 \u2018The poet is one who shall draw us with love and terror,\u2019 who sees through our comforting illusions, to \u2018chaunt our own times and social circumstances,\u2019 and speaks of the unique genius that is America,\u201d Glaude said.\", 'He then reminded listeners of the violent, predominantly white mob of Trump supporters who breached the Capitol Jan. 6 with the aim of stopping the count of Electoral College votes that verified President Joe Biden\u2019s presidential victory. Glaude contrasted the actions of police officers during the riot with their treatment of protestors in the aftermath of George Floyd\u2019s murder last May.', '\u201cI recall \u2026 startling images of police aggressively accosting protestors [in Minneapolis],\u201d Glaude said. \u201cOn Jan. 6 though, as some police risked and gave their lives in defense of the Capitol, I saw others taking selfies.\u201d', 'Additionally, Glaude said the Capitol insurrectionists \u2014 some of whom wielded \u201cwhite militia paraphernalia\u201d \u2014 showed the fragility of democracy and the threats it faces.', '\u201cThis was a riot fueled by white resentment, white grievances and white hatred,\u201d Glaude said. \u201cWhat has been revealed is that this ideology of white supremacy threatens, once again, to swallow whole this fragile experiment in democracy.\u201d', 'The combination of COVID-19, the Capitol insurrection and a historic racial reckoning \u2014 initiated by protests against police brutality following George Floyd\u2019s murder \u2014 caused Glaude to ask, \u201cHow do we imagine unity in the face of all of this?\u201d', 'This is where he turned to Baldwin.', \"In his book published last year, \u201cBegin Again: James Baldwin's America and Its Urgent Lessons for Our Own,\u201d Glaude draws lessons from Baldwin\u2019s poetry to look at race in America today. Baldwin was known for writing on topics of race, sexuality and class, and his writing ran in parallel to some of the major movements of the mid-twentieth century, including the civil rights movement and the gay liberation movement.\\xa0\", 'To Glaude, the Capitol riot was reminiscent of conservatives countering the Black Freedom Movement \u2014 the period encompassing both the civil rights movement and the Black Power movement \u2014 in the mid-1900s. During that time, there were many protests resisting the struggle for equality. Glaude used a James Baldwin quote to reflect the continuation of systemic racism and how history is repeating itself.\\xa0', '\u201c\u2018The horror is that America \u2026 changes all the time, without ever changing at all,\u2019\u201d Glaude said.', 'The rioters at the Capitol, to Glaude, were \u201crefusing to grow up, reveling in the fantasy \u2026 that ours must remain a white nation in the vein of old Europe.\u201d \\xa0', 'Glaude also discussed COVID-19 pandemic\u2019s disproportionate impact on Black and Latinx communities, which has been perpetuated by pre-existing healthcare inequities. Racial and ethnic minority groups are at increased risk of getting and dying from COVID-19 due to limited access to healthcare, educational and income gaps and disproportionate representation in essential work settings, among other factors.\\xa0', 'Glaude noted that the pandemic has also given rise to and revealed housing and food insecurity. Millions of Americans have struggled with being able to put food on the table during the pandemic. In a survey by the U.S. Census Bureau, 27 percent of Black respondents and 23 percent of Latino respondents reported sometimes or often not having enough to eat over the course of a week, compared to 12 percent of white respondents.\\xa0', 'Unemployment has also disproportionately affected lower-income and minority communities.

An anonymous source affiliated with an IFC chapter \u201ccan say with a good degree of confidence that most fraternities broke the six-person rule once or twice, at least.\u201d Combined with numerous reports of large gatherings from Greek life chapters and photo and video evidence of disregard for rules, this paints a picture of what many students already knew \u2014 many fraternities and sororities believe they are held to a different standard. The University messed up, and they refuse to acknowledge this.', 'Students took to social media this past week to express their anger with those continuing to gather in large crowds and with the University\u2019s disregard of these students. Certain chapters of the IFC and ISC, in particular, hosted in-person bid day events this past Sunday, while many fraternities also even held in-person rush events. Despite a six-person gathering limit, many fraternities were encouraged by ambiguous rules from the University \u2014 which allowed for in-person rush events that followed COVID-19 guidelines, despite the guidelines prohibiting gatherings to six inhabitants \u2014 to bring groups of rushing students into their houses of over six inhabitants. Many are even calling on the University to suspend non-compliant chapters until the end of the semester.\\xa0', 'As this surge in cases continues \u2014 and as we wait for the incubation period to finish to get a better insight of the effects of in-person bid day and rush events \u2014 the fact remains that there were fraternities that blatantly ignored the rules. Remember that the University was complicit in the behavior of Greek-life organizations this past week, and that this complicity directly endangered the lives and well-being of thousands of students and even more members of the Charlottesville community.\\xa0', 'The University has since pushed a narrative of general student body noncompliance. At a recent Town Hall, University administration continued to highlight that while fraternities likely did cause some of the increases, the uptick in cases was widespread both on- and off-Grounds.

In addition, regardless of any widespread cases, this shift of responsibility ignores a key aspect of the spread \u2014 fraternities willingly acted in a manner that has been known to increase the spread.

Further, in a widely-circulated internal message, the IFC president asks members to cease in-person activity, as \u201cthe consequences are potentially disastrous for the IFC.\u201d The question therefore remains \u2014 do these organizations care at all that their actions could have incredibly \u201cdisastrous\u201d consequences on the local community?\\xa0', 'Maybe the University could not, as it says, stop the decision of a student-run organization to have off-Grounds gatherings that were supposed to follow guidelines. However, it believed a governing body of 13 fraternity men could hold over 1,700 members across 32 chapters accountable and did not adequately step in to enforce its own policy over these students\u2019 behavior. Yet, the University stance suggests that they will continue to avoid holding Greek life responsible.\\xa0', 'At the end of the day, students have been bringing these concerns to the University\u2019s administration for weeks now.

The data is not going to definitively show what caused this rise in numbers \u2014 that\u2019s simply not possible. But two weeks of wide scale in-person recruitment went essentially unchecked.

The terror of Aug. 11 and 12, 2017 resurfaced Jan. 6 with immeasurable intensity as thousands of pro-Trump rioters stormed the nation\u2019s Capitol in a baseless attempt to overturn the results of the 2020 election. Frighteningly similar to the violence of the 2017 Unite the Right rally, the events of Jan. 6 have once again turned national attention towards Charlottesville \u2014 the community cited as the inspiration for a presidential campaign, yet nonetheless deemed unworthy of a presidential visit. Perhaps reflecting such dismissive attitudes, in a moment demanding strong condemnation, the University community was met with a disturbingly weak response from its leadership \u2014 a response that, for many, borders on silence.', 'Indeed, with all eyes on Charlottesville, University President Jim Ryan expressed a \u201cmixture of anger, disbelief and sadness\u201d in an introduction to the Jan. 6 Democracy Dialogues event with Professor Larry Sabato. Although denouncing what he labeled an \u201cattack on our democracy,\u201d President Ryan\u2019s condemnation of the violence ended there. In a community for which far-right extremism continues to plague collective memory, such a lackluster response is, quite simply, insufficient. At the very least, President Ryan has a duty to condemn the Jan. 6 riots in a statement to all University community members \u2014 not simply those present at a preplanned event. As noted in a previous criticism of President Ryan\u2019s response to the murder of George Floyd and the protests that rocked the nation in 2020, we look to the leaders of our educational institutions as an example of change and strength in tumultuous times. In this moment, however, such an example is notably lacking.', 'Further, University leadership must reassert its commitment to combating widespread prejudice and systemic inequity in and beyond the University community. Although some argue that the Jan. 6 riots were not explicitly motivated by white supremacy, the presence of a Confederate flag in our nation\u2019s Capitol Building suggests otherwise. Like the violence of the 2017 Unite the Right rally, the events of Jan. 6 were yet another manifestation of the deep-seated racism that has terrorized BIPOC communities in the United States for centuries. In a University built by slaves and once celebrated as a center of eugenicist thought and practice, any failure to strongly condemn the recent attack on our nation\u2019s democracy represents a failure to renounce a legacy of Black exploitation. This in turn perpetuates the suffering of the University\u2019s Black and Brown communities as well as that of the Charlottesville community at large \u2014 a community whose past, present and future is indelibly tied to that of the University.', \"Indeed, as noted in a recent Cavalier Daily opinion column from Bryce Wyles, the lack of an adequate response to prejudice only allows such prejudice to grow. The same is true in this situation. Among Charlottesville community members, the consequences of the 2017 Unite the Right Rally extend far beyond momentary destruction and a fleeting terror. They are, in effect, a source of ongoing exploitation and visceral human suffering. Similarly, the University community is intimately familiar with intolerance and bigotry, a familiarity sustained by an administrative failure to respond to acts of prejudice like that at our nation\u2019s capital. In the past semester alone, students have constructed and violently destroyed a wall with the phrase \u201cBlack Lives Matter'' and a professor has made racially insensitive remarks in an effort at humor during a lecture.\\xa0\", 'Both instances \u2014 along with the countless other aggressions experienced by BIPOC students on a regular basis \u2014 passed relatively unpunished among University administrators. This in turn resulted in the normalization of such behavior in our community. Reflecting this pattern of inaction, recent administrative failures to adequately respond to the violence at the Capitol Building \u2014 a building uniquely symbolic of a national legacy of racism \u2014 sends a silent message that hatred and violence, though not openly celebrated, are also not publicly condemned in the University community. Such a message is more than exclusionary. It is oppressive. It is violent. It is dangerous.', 'The University has a unique opportunity to tackle its legacy of prejudice and to act as an example of growth and acceptance for institutions throughout the United States. Last month\u2019s acts of terror at the Capitol are just another manifestation of the terror that plagued Charlottesville in 2017 and, for that matter, the terror that has tormented the University\u2019s non-white community since its inception. As we have seen, true change requires much more than an isolated, weak response to such events as they occur. It first demands strong and unwavering condemnation and, later, a commitment to sustained dialogue and the ongoing, systemic support of the University\u2019s BIPOC communities. After all, continued silence in the midst of prejudice only signals acceptance \u2014 an acceptance that perpetuates a legacy of hatred, exclusion and violence.', 'Maddie Stokes is an Opinion Columnist for The Cavalier Daily.

I think I was six when I first started journaling with a notebook that had a lock and key \u2014 after all, a six-year-old has pretty confidential information to hide from prying eyes.

However, a lot has changed since my early journaling days. For one, I no longer rip apart my journals. Instead, I keep them in an overflowing memory box at my parents\u2019 home \u2014 the oldest one dating back to when I was in sixth grade. Being able to look back at my thoughts from such a long time ago feels a bit like entering a time machine, and I regret not having even older entries to reflect upon.', 'Despite having so many journals from the last eight years or so, I have to admit that I haven\u2019t been as consistent with journaling as I hoped to be. I have gone through periods where I write multiple pages each day, but there have also been times where I won\u2019t touch my journal for weeks or months. Why, you might ask? In all honesty, the answer to that question is one that I myself don\u2019t have.', 'I initially fell into journaling due to my love for words. From poetry to books to writing essays for school, I have always felt a strong appreciation for the words I wrote and read and the power those words held. In elementary school, I first developed this love by writing short stories in English class. Eventually, this evolved into poetry writing which I still continue to do so today. Somewhere along the way, I found another way to expand this appreciation for words and that happened to be through journaling.\\xa0', 'Over the years, I think it has grown to be more than just another way to explore the art of words. Through my journaling experience, I have grown to view my journal as a space where I could be unapologetically me. Contrary to the fear that my younger self had, the only person who has access to my journal is myself. It is a place where I can release grudges I have been harboring, emotions I\u2019m not sure how to express, painful memories I needed to let go of and so much more. This ability to liberate myself is the reason I have continued to journal \u2014 it provides a space that is all mine.\\xa0', 'When I think of journaling in this way, I find it astonishing that I can go so long without writing a journal entry for months. Something that feels so personal, so therapeutic should be something I want to do all the time but I wonder why it feels like a chore at times.\\xa0', 'Despite not having a concrete answer for this presently, I have come to the belief that I think we \u2014 as individuals or even society as a whole \u2014 place too much pressure and stress on hobbies.

Hobbies are not supposed to be stressful or something that puts pressure on us, but why is it that our hobbies often stress us out and feel like a chore?\\xa0', 'In speaking for my own journaling hobby, I put far too much pressure on creating the perfect entry.

I put too much pressure on myself to try to make journaling a daily habit. \\xa0In reality, that just isn\u2019t realistic nor is it a healthy mindset to have while journaling. I should not be putting an expectation on myself when it comes to writing a journal entry. There is no reason that every single entry I make should be pages long or encompass everything \u2014 it should simply be what I need it to be at the moment. If that means just writing one sentence, there is nothing wrong with that.\\xa0', 'Now, this is so much easier said than done. On days I don\u2019t feel like journaling, it\u2019s always in the back of my mind as something I \u2018should\u2019 do. But the thing is, there are no real rules when it comes to journaling or any other hobbies that we may choose to undertake, and there shouldn\u2019t be. Hobbies are supposed to be something we find pleasure in \u2014 not something we should feel pressured to do.\\xa0', 'Even while writing this, I still feel a tiny obligation to be consistent with journaling. Since it has been a part of my life for so long, I am not sure if that sense of duty will ever go away completely. However, I know and recognize now that my journal will still be there day after day, waiting until I\u2019m ready to write a new entry. Even if I skip out on writing for a few days, weeks or even months, my journal won\u2019t be going anywhere. When I need a space to express my inner thoughts, I know that I can reach for my pen and notebook whenever. Although I still often feel the need to practice my journaling everyday, I know the last thing I want to do is think of such an enjoyable and fulfilling hobby as a looming chore.

These two groups were not included in previous surveys of the Asian American population.\\xa0', 'The University\u2019s Diversity Dashboard has broad identity categorizations, only including the categories of \u201cAsian American\u201d and \u201cNative Hawaiian or Pacific Islander\u201d to represent the APIDA population. One of the goals of the survey was to provide a breakdown of the ethnicities that make up the University\u2019s APIDA population, because, according to Pathak, the University\u2019s broad categorizations make it \u201charder to see differences within ethnicities.\u201d The report divided ethnicities into the categories of East Asian American, South Asian American, Southeast Asian American and Other, which includes Central Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. Within each category are various subgroups.\\xa0', 'According to the report, the greatest number of Asians and Asian Americans at the University are East Asian \u2014 51.5 percent of respondents \u2014 followed by South Asian \u2014 31 percent of respondents. The largest groups of APIDA students are Chinese Americans, who made up 29.7 percent of all respondents, followed by Indian Americans, who made up 22.8 percent of all respondents. This is consistent with national Asian demographics. Korean Americans, Vietnamese Americans and Filipino Americans are the next largest APIDA groups at the University, making up 16 percent, 9.6 percent and 7.2 percent of all respondents, respectively.\\xa0', 'Only 0.2 percent of the survey respondents identified themselves as Pacific Islanders, whereas they make up 7.1 percent of the national APIDA population and 6 percent of Virginia\u2019s APIDA population. According to the University\u2019s Diversity Dashboard, in 2019, only 0.07 percent of the total undergraduate population identified as Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander.\\xa0', 'In the preface to the results, Chong described how Asian Americans are often neglected when it comes to thinking about racial politics and are instead grouped under white people due to presumptions about their economic privilege, despite also being a minority group.', 'The demographics results report disaggregates data and is intended to inform the University community about the diversity of the APIDA population. By portraying the different experiences and disadvantages faced by members of the APIDA population, the results also seek to correct the \u201cmodel minority myth\u201d \u2014 the stereotype that Asian Americans are able to attain educational and financial success and thus serve as a \u201cmodel\u201d for other minority groups.\\xa0', '\u201cWhile this is not to say that APIDAs face the same challenges and\/or level of discrimination that other racialized minority and indigenous groups face, we must not presume that APIDAs are uniformly privileged or that their economic or educational privileges protect them from the macro- and micro-aggressions of racism and xenophobia,\u201d Chong wrote in the preface.\\xa0', 'Several sections of the report are dedicated to distributions of variables by generation and ethnicity.', 'When undergraduate household income was grouped by ethnicity, it was discovered that compared to other Asian ethnicities, a higher proportion of South Asian American respondents \u2014 52 percent \u2014 are in the highest income bracket, making over $150,000. A lower proportion of South Asian American respondents \u2014 11 percent \u2014 are in the lowest income bracket, indicating a family income of less than $50,000.', 'According to the report, graduate students were not asked about their household income because they are usually independent and as a result have lower household incomes that may not be representative of family economic privileges.\\xa0', 'Within all other ethnicity groupings, 20 to 22 percent reported household income in the lowest bracket. Southeast Asian American and Asian international student households were revealed to be much less likely to be in the top income bracket compared to East and South Asian American households.', 'As a whole, about 60 percent of APIDA students reported income in the bottom three brackets while the median household income range for APIDA students is in the $100,000 to $150,000 bracket.\\xa0', '\u201cEvery single ethnicity grouping or every single generational group has its own tendencies that are completely different from others,\u201d Young said. \u201cEven though we don\u2019t know the concrete reasons behind why, [for example] some ethnicities go towards one major compared to another, it\u2019s really interesting to look at how U.Va.\u2019s Asian population varies so much.\u201d', 'When grouping undergraduate household income with languages spoken, it was discovered that the below $50,000 income bracket had a slight majority of individuals who spoke a foreign language only. On the other hand, individuals who spoke English only or who were multilingual had more representation in the upper income brackets. 66.6 percent of APIDA households speak other languages at home, and 74.5 percent of APIDA households speak English some or all of the time.\\xa0', 'Compared to other groups, a higher proportion of South Asian Americans speak a foreign language while Southeast Asian families have the greatest proportion of English-only speakers.\\xa0', 'The majority \u2014 63 percent \u2014 of respondents are second-generation students, meaning that they were born in the United States and have two parents who immigrated. 20 percent are first-generation students.', 'When generation is grouped by ethnicity, South Asian Americans have the lowest proportion of 2.5+ generation students \u2014 students with one or more parents born in the U.S. Southeast Asian Americans have the largest proportion of 2.5+ generation students.\\xa0', 'Over half of first-generation households speak only in a foreign language, and 39 percent speak in both English and a foreign language. For second-generation households, the percent speaking two or more languages, including English, increases to 53 percent. In households past 2.5+ generations, however, 84 percent speak English only.\\xa0', 'The day the report was published, Young and Pathak sent out a wave of emails to leaders of student organizations and University administration, faculty and staff \u2014 including people from the Office of Admissions, the Office of the Dean of Students and the Office for Diversity, Equity and Inclusion \u2014 to share their results.', 'Young and Pathak hope that their results can help the University determine what the Asian American community\u2019s current needs are. Although this report focused solely on demographics, following reports will explore APIDA experiences at the University specifically.\\xa0', '\u201cI don\u2019t think we can be too optimistic especially since the University has so much on its plate,\u201d Young said. \u201cBut we would really hope for the University to provide more resources and spaces for Asian and Asian American students.\u201d\\xa0', 'The results also match ethnicities to majors. 63.4 percent of respondents are majoring in a STEM-related field, compared to 22.5 percent of all students at the University. Within every single ethnic group, STEM majors are the most popular, but they are especially popular among East and South Asian Americans. First-generation students have the highest proportion of STEM majors.\\xa0', 'The report attributes the fact that second-generation students and beyond may have more representation in humanities, social science and professional fields \u201cbecause their generation status affords them higher levels of English language proficiency, cultural assimilation and social capital in the U.S., which allows them access to the \u201csoft\u201d skills required by these majors.\u201d \\xa0A significantly larger number \u2014 17 percent \u2014 of third-generation students have entered the professional field than any other generation. Majors defined as professional include majors in the Frank Batten School of Leadership and Public Policy, the School of Education and Human Development, the McIntire School of Commerce, the School of Nursing and the School of Architecture.\\xa0', 'While this first report was released a year after the survey initially opened, the following reports are expected to take less time. All the data from the survey has already been cleaned and analyzed, so it\u2019s just a matter of making charts and writing the actual report.\\xa0', 'Because Pathak has already graduated and Young is graduating this year, the second report is being taken on by two other members of the ASU executive board \u2014 second-year College student Steven Jiang and third-year College student Kathryn Gatuslao. According to Jiang, the second report should hopefully be complete by the end of the semester, and if not, by the first few weeks of the next semester. They are still unsure, however, of who will succeed them in writing the following reports.\\xa0', '\u201cWithin the last five years, I think U.Va. has increased their initiatives focused on making sure that U.Va. remains an inclusive atmosphere for everyone,\u201d Pathak said. \u201cAs these initiatives continue to happen, I think that the reports \u2014 all five of them or even this one \u2014 will remain invaluable for [the University] to understand what the student perspective is because it\u2019s really hard I think for faculty to see what it\u2019s like living as a student.']","366":"['A week after the start of the semester and following the season\u2019s second snowfall, Department of Medicine Chair Mitch Rosner discussed the COVID-19 spread on Grounds and the different set of challenges winter would bring in an interview with The Cavalier Daily.', 'Since the interview, where Rosner initially spoke about the limitations of winter on outdoor gatherings, the University has banned all in-person gatherings on and off Grounds and closed recreational facilities and libraries on Grounds. The most common close-contact indoor settings on Grounds have become residence halls, dining rooms and in-person classes.', 'The University banned all in-person gatherings Feb. 16 after two days of record-breaking COVID-19 case numbers \u2014 121 new COVID-19 cases were reported Feb. 15 and 229 new cases were reported Feb. 16. The previous high was 59 new cases on Sept. 17 following a testing backlog.\\xa0', 'In-person classes, however, will continue with additional safety measures to limit congregation before and after classes. This semester, 27 percent of classes offer an in-person component.\\xa0', 'Because of the mask-wearing guidance in place for all in-person instruction \u2014 students are required to wear masks at all times \u2014 Rosner feels that classrooms are the safest of those three settings. According to Rosner, when the University conducted contact tracing among people in shared classrooms, there was no evidence of significant spread in a classroom environment.\\xa0', '\u201cI think that\u2019s predicated on a couple of things,\u201d Rosner said. \u201cThe students are all wearing masks, they\u2019re distanced, we have enhanced ventilation in the classrooms [and] professors are behind plexiglass. I think if you do all those things it seems like the risk in a classroom is probably low.\u201d', 'Rosner said that residence hall environments are much more conducive to COVID-19 spread.', '\u201cObviously living in close proximity to people is probably the highest risk,\u201d Rosner said. \u201cIt was not uncommon for suites of students to get infected at the same time or roommates to get infected, so those are high risk situations that are really hard to mitigate.\u201d', 'From Feb. 3 to Feb. 8, 17 positive cases were identified in Gibbons dormitory, and all residents were asked to quarantine in their rooms for 24 hours on Feb. 8 so that an additional round of testing could be conducted. No additional positive cases were found, and students were permitted to leave the building on the morning of Feb. 10.\\xa0', 'The situation inside dining rooms, on the other hand, was not as safe as socially distanced in-person instruction but not nearly as high-risk as residence halls, Rosner said.', 'Due to the new regulations, dining rooms are open and pick-up options are available, but in-person seating is limited to two people per table. \\xa0', '\u201cYou\u2019ve gotta take your mask off to eat, but again, if you are keeping distance [and] you\u2019re not there for a prolonged period of time, it\u2019s probably lower than living with somebody but probably intermediate between [being] with someone in a classroom,\u201d Rosner said.', 'In addition to requiring students to undergo weekly prevalence testing this semester, the University has increased the number of days that positive students have to wait before being tested again from 90 to 150 days, in accordance with evolving studies on the matter.', '\u201cWe were finding that there were, in fact, people that remain positive still after 90 days,\u201d Rosner said. \u201cMost importantly, the data now is pretty good that there are no reinfection cases that can be identified before 150 days. So, the fact that we knew that there was continued shedding of remnant particles without any risk and that there are no documented cases before 150 days of reinfection made us pretty comfortable that we could move that out.\u201d', 'Beyond current testing and case data, the University\u2019s public health team has one semester of experience to fall back on and can take lessons from their own successes and struggles in the fall. Their two primary takeaways, Rosner said, were that obedience to public health guidelines around mask wearing, social distancing, gathering sizes and good hygiene were critical to stopping the spread and that implementing prevalence testing \u201con a cadence\u201d enabled the University to detect asymptomatic cases and cut off chains of transmission. He also mentioned the importance of pre-arrival testing in allowing both semesters to get off to a better start.', '\u201cHaving people not come back who were harboring asymptomatic infections made a big difference,\u201d Rosner said. \u201cIt made life a lot easier for us.\u201d', 'Between Jan. 1 and Feb. 7, there were 187 positive student tests conducted through pre-arrival testing, but these numbers are not included in the total number of positive student cases. As of Tuesday, there are 853 active student cases in the community \u2014 over 650 were from last week.\\xa0', 'According to Rosner, discovering cases via LetsGet Checked before students return is part of the reason that the University believes that bringing them back to Grounds has not materially impacted the trajectory of COVID-19 in the broader Charlottesville-Albemarle community.', '\u201cWe could not detect that there was any demonstrable change in the incidence of infection rates in the [Blue Ridge Health District] when the students came back, other than the student cases,\u201d Rosner said. \u201cWhen the [Virginia Department of Health] did contact tracings, they also could not detect that there was any impact of the students on cases that were in the community.\u201d', 'With all of those competing factors in mind, Rosner said that the University\u2019s overall public health strategy is predicated on ensuring the most ideal outcomes for all stakeholders involved.', '\u201cThe president\u2019s office and the provost\u2019s office are constantly pushing on us to relax guidelines,\u201d Rosner said. \u201cWhat we really want to be able to do is give students that college experience, the ability to interact, at the same time balancing that against the safety issues. That\u2019s gonna be a tension that\u2019s gonna go on throughout the semester. We\u2019re really cognizant of that and trying to balance that, but our primary responsibility is to maintain everybody\u2019s safety.\u201d']","367":"['It\u2019s been a long seven years, and it will be a few years longer before all is said and done, but students and fans rejoice \u2014 Electronic Arts Sports has announced plans to revive the hibernating \u201cNCAA Football\u201d video game. EA produced a version of the game every year between 1994 and 2013 and included the likenesses of legendary amateur athletes from Tom Brady to Johnny Manziel.', 'The game\u2019s production halted after \u201cNCAA Football 14\u2019s\u201d release in August 2013 due to looming factors that threatened the game\u2019s profitability. EA claims the main reason the game was discontinued is that the major Football Bowl Subdivision conferences were leaning away from renewing their licensing agreements. This would have eliminated school names, logos, stadiums, uniforms, fight songs, mascots, player likenesses and the kitchen sink from future games. The studio guessed, probably correctly, that it would be hard to sell consumers on a game where users could only pit the Charlottesville Horsemen against the Southern Virginia Gobblers for the State Trophy.', 'A darker reason for the NCAA game stoppage was a class action lawsuit that EA was entangled in at the time led by former UCLA basketball player Ed O\u2019Bannon. He and several other athletes filed lawsuits against the manufacturer because their likenesses were being used, yet they weren\u2019t seeing any royalties from the games because of the NCAA\u2019s circuitous rules on amateurism.\\xa0', 'Now though, things are different. Congress is considering legislation that would allow collegiate athletes to legally profit off of their name, image and likeness. This, combined with the homebound young adults rediscovering their old NCAA games, brought a surge in optimism for new installments in the series. This all culminated in the announcement of a newly named \u201cEA Sports College Football,\u201d slated for initial release as early as the 2022 preseason.', 'These factors combined to take away seven years and counting of potential digital excellence emerging from Scott Stadium. Under Coach Bronco Mendenhall, the Cavaliers have experienced a miniature gridiron renaissance, registering three consecutive non-losing seasons and the program\u2019s highest AP poll ranking since 2007. The team has also had several NFL-caliber talents pass through Grounds over the last few years \u2014 the best of whom were never featured in any iconic NCAA video games.', 'Before we dive into the top 10 Virginia players who would have balled out in a virtual world, it is important to note that the most fun players in college football gaming are generally ones with elite physical tools, not those with great fundamentals\\xa0\u2014 many apologies to Kurt Benkert, an accurate but lead-footed Cavalier quarterback in 2016 and 2017. Additionally, offensive skill position players are generally more enjoyable to use in virtual play than linemen and defenders because they have a higher chance of actually touching the football. Now, without further ado, let\u2019s get into it.', '10. Quarterback Keytaon Thompson in the 2020 season', 'Thompson is possibly the most versatile player on this list. While nominally a quarterback at Mississippi State, the 6-foot-4, 215-pound spring transfer lined up as quarterback, wide receiver and running back throughout last season. This maximized his prototypical size and speed and got the ball in his hands as much as possible. While that didn\u2019t amount to much real-life production, his physicality would be ripe for video game experimentation.', '9. Strong safety Juan Thornhill in the 2018 season', 'So far, Thornhill has had as much NFL impact as anyone on this list, notching four interceptions and reaching two Super Bowls in his two professional seasons. Thornhill possesses exceptional speed \u2014 he ran a 4.42-second 40-yard dash at the 2019 NFL Combine \u2014 and had a nose for tackles behind the line. The defensive back was also a phenomenal ballhawk, registering 13 interceptions and 26 passes defended in three seasons. It\u2019s not everyone\u2019s bread and butter to control a safety on a video game defense, but Thornhill would have been good enough to alter that mindset.', '8. Wide receiver Lavel Davis Jr. in the 2020 season', 'It\u2019s not talked about much, but Lavel Davis is huge \u2014 like, 6-foot-7, 210 pounds huge \u2014\\xa0and somehow still very good at catching passes. Davis\u2019 volume numbers in 2020 weren\u2019t tremendous \u2014 20 catches in seven games \u2014 but he made the most of those receptions and converted a quarter of them into touchdowns, with an average of over 25 yards per catch \u2014 the most in the ACC. Having a receiver who can catch everything is super fun in these games, and Davis seems to catch everything.', '7. OLB Max Valles in the 2014 season', 'Valles didn\u2019t have much success past his 2014 season in Charlottesville \u2014 he was drafted in the sixth round of the 2015 NFL Draft, was cut four times and ultimately never played in a professional game. But he balled out in his last season as a Cavalier, the first without an NCAA video game \u2014 terrorizing opposing passers, finishing second in the ACC with nine sacks and recording 12.5 tackles behind the line. His muscular frame and quick-twitch speed allowed him to get around offensive linemen with a bevy of moves. If you\u2019re into controlling pass rushers when defending in football video games, Valles would have been a joy to chase virtual quarterbacks with.', '6. Quarterback Brennan Armstrong in the 2021 season', 'Armstrong technically shouldn\u2019t be on this list, but since there won\u2019t be an EA video game until next year at the earliest, we\u2019re counting it. Armstrong has the tools to be a good player on the field and a great one on the screen. The Ohio native is big, fast, strong and smart. He just never managed to put it all together for Virginia this year, except maybe in the victory over North Carolina. But next year, he could make the ballyhooed leap to a very good quarterback. His aggressive, improvisational style of play would translate well into a video game.', '5. Wide receiver Olamide Zaccheaus in the 2018 season', 'The real tragedy of the original NCAA games is that they could never include names, and Olamide Zaccheaus is an awesome name. It\u2019s also a shame that we never got the chance to build around such an explosive and versatile player. Zaccheaus spent time as halfback, wide receiver and return man at various points in his career, and in both 2017 and 2018, he totaled over 1,000 scrimmage yards. Though Madden 21 rates his speed at 89 out of 100, they are really underestimating his abilities. In an NCAA game, he would be among the fastest, and therefore one of the most dangerous, players on the field because you could plug him in at any skill position and watch him work.', '4. Cornerback Bryce Hall in the 2018 season', 'Like the safety position, controlling a cornerback in a video game can be tricky, especially for beginners. Hall was good enough that he could have made the position playable for anyone. Hall is not especially large for a corner, but he made up for it with speed, swagger and swatting passes. He stuck to his men well and consistently defended passes that were thrown his way. As a junior in 2018, he led the nation in passes defended with 24 and was unlucky enough to not pick up more than two interceptions. Only his inconvenient position leaves him this low on the list.', '3. ILB Micah Kiser in the 2017 season', 'The best Madden players tend to control the middle linebacker when playing defense because it allows for flexibility and maximum field coverage. Kiser would have been the perfect player to fill that role in a theoretical \u201cNCAA Football 18.\u201d He was capable of being almost anywhere at any time, and it showed \u2014 he led the ACC in tackles twice, racked up 19 career sacks and created nine turnovers in three seasons. The future pro could cover tight ends and running backs in man coverage, hold down the middle of the field in zone and stuff big running backs on any given play. The thought of dropping big hits with Kiser on unsuspecting wide receivers sparks joy in me.', '2. Wide receiver Joe Reed in the 2019 season', 'If you never had the joy of using Chicago Bears return man Devin Hester in the Madden games of the late-aughts, that\u2019s quite a shame. If you did, then you probably understand how fun Joe Reed would have been in a video game. Like Hester, Reed combines blazing open field speed with a magic in tight spaces that often led to a massive special teams advantage. In addition to elevating his physical talents, the video game setting would make his perceived flaws \u2014 namely, his inability to run complex routes and create space at the line of scrimmage \u2014 more or less irrelevant thanks to plays like the legendary four verticals. Reed is exactly the type of player that has been most amplified by these games in the past, to the full benefit of the gamer.', '1. Quarterback Bryce Perkins in the 2019 season', 'Perkins is the undisputed king of this list. He has been one of the most exciting players to grace the home bench at Scott Stadium since Shawn Moore 30 years ago. Perkins used his legs not only to rack up rushing yards \u2014 1,692 in two seasons \u2014 but also to extend plays long enough that he could slice up defenses with his big arm. He could make a crisp throw to any level of the field with accuracy and juke a defender out of his cleats in the same breath if he wanted. Like Reed, Perkins would also benefit from the video game deemphasizing some of his weaknesses, which were his consistency and rhythm. This makes him easily the most exciting Virginia player we missed thanks to the extended hiatus of college football video games.', 'It\u2019s truly sad that we never got to use any of these players, and more than likely never will, in an NCAA video game. However, Virginia football recently notched the 32nd-best recruiting class in the country, including three-star quarterback Jacob Rodriguez. Rodriguez and many others will be center-stage just in time for the projected return of an iconic gaming franchise.

She started the project and helped guide the research while Loren Moulds, head of digital scholarship at the Law School, built the site and Logan Heiman, Law School communication specialist, managed the project operations when he joined the team in 2019. Flaherty pointed out that there were a number of others who contributed to the project through providing research, preserving and scanning the notebooks and offering feedback.\\xa0', 'The new website features student notes that are also currently held at the University\u2019s Law Library and demonstrate the transformation of the legal curriculum over time. According to the website, these notes largely focus on legal theory and display how the Law School faculty and students learned and applied the law to bear upon questions of property, contracts and slavery', 'The notes also showed that it was rare for an entire lecture to be dedicated to enslavement \u2014 rather, it was more common for students to learn about slavery and enslaved people through discussions on property law and the U.S. Constitution, by which professors would bring up the laws of slavery and their theoretical interpretations of slavery.', 'Ultimately, the students\u2019 notes revealed that the Law School supplied students of the antebellum period with legal justifications for slavery.', 'Moreover, the website features the profiles of people and places with a meaningful connection to the Law School during the time period. This included enslaved people, professors and buildings on Grounds. \\xa0', 'The website features the key profile of Lewis Commodore, who was the only person known to be directly enslaved by the University. According to the website, Commodore served as a Rotunda bell ringer and janitor before a group of faculty members, including Law Professor John A.G. Davis, purchased him for 580 dollars. These professors were later reimbursed by the Board of Visitors.', 'Additionally, the website spotlights the profile of John B. Minor, who became a law professor in 1845 and taught for 50 years before retiring shortly before his death. Minor became a prominent legal scholar in the South who was unsure of the constitutionality of secession but thought it was important to protect the South\u2019s institutions, which included slavery. Minor Hall, which is located on Central Grounds, is named after Minor and became the Law School building in 1911.', 'Flaherty pointed out that given that the Law School is currently located on North Grounds, many forget that the Law School was actually located on Main Grounds during its first 150 years of existence.', 'The website also discusses the Sunnyside property, which is where the Law School currently sits. During the 19th century, several families lived on this land which was farmed by enslaved people. According to Flaherty, this land was originally occupied by the Monocan nation and then purchased by the Duke Family in 1863.', '\u201cWe know that wheat, fruit, hay, sugar and corn grew here,\u201d Flaherty said. \u201cWe know the names of some of the enslaved people who lived and labored here. We also know that the Duke property \u2014 back along the current Rivanna trail, behind the Law and Business schools \u2014 was used after the Civil War as a site for large and well-known barbecues in Charlottesville during U.Va. reunions and for the Cool Spring Barbecue Club.\u201d', 'The Cool Spring Barbeque Club, like other barbecues, was an event hosted by Col. R. T. W. Duke, Sr., where dignitaries across the state would gather to build connections with each other while eating squirrel stew, pork barbecue and whiskey, among other things.

To start with the good news, women\u2019s swim and dive won the ACC Championship for the third time in four years. In addition, the women\u2019s lacrosse team started off its season with two wins, and the men\u2019s lacrosse team stayed undefeated as well. Women\u2019s golf finished third in its invitational, and baseball opened its season with a 2-1 series against Connecticut. Unfortunately, not every team was this great. Men\u2019s basketball suffered two painful losses, and softball kicked off the season going just 1-2 in a round-robin in Durham, N.C. Let\u2019s take a look at five takeaways from the week of Feb. 15.', 'Florida State was able to make Virginia play to its strengths', 'Much of Virginia basketball\u2019s success under Coach Tony Bennett has come from creating a game flow that fits the Cavaliers\u2019 slow, deliberate pace of play. Even in 2019, the NCAA National Championship year with a potent offense, Virginia was last in all of Division I in tempo. In many ways, Coach Leonard Hamiton\u2019s Florida State squads are the antithesis of this Virginia pace. Florida State loves to use their athleticism and length to gain fast break opportunities, and that is exactly what happened in Monday\u2019s 81-60 shellacking of the Cavaliers. For Virginia fans, it felt like the game was over at halftime when Florida State took a 20-point lead. Although Virginia made a run to get within seven, the Seminoles got back to their fast-paced ways and responded with a crushing 20-2 run. The length of Florida State bothered Virginia\u2019s small guards, and the Seminoles were able to turn 13 Virginia turnovers into 14 points of their own. Look for the Cavaliers to cut down on their turnovers and limit fast break opportunities \u2014 two pillars of the program that Bennett cannot be happy with after Monday night.', 'There was a lot to be learned from lineups in basketball\u2019s loss to Duke', 'In what cannot be described as a surprise to anyone who has watched Virginia basketball over the past few years, the Cavaliers lost a close game to Duke Saturday, falling 66-65. It was an unfortunate loss, but one crucial theory was proven for good in the matchup \u2014\\xa0lineups matter. It is vital to this Virginia team to have either senior forward Sam Hauser or junior forward Trey Murphy on the court at all times. During a stretch in the first half, both were watching from the bench as Virginia\u2019s offense suddenly shrank into the paint. There was no room to drive, which is what the Cavaliers\u2019 backcourt does best. Ultimately, a team needs shooters to stretch the defense, and without Hauser or Murphy, this Virginia team simply does not have the outside threats to keep defenses honest. Even though Murphy only finished with four points on the night, his importance on the court cannot be understated. With a Blue Devil defender essentially joined to him at the hip, it opened up the key for senior center Jay Huff to work in the post without fear of a double team. The lineups throughout the Duke game created disadvantages for Virginia\\xa0\u2014 something the Cavaliers could work on heading into the NC State game Wednesday.', 'A dominant win is the way to get back on track for men\u2019s tennis', 'As Virginia men\u2019s tennis came into its Friday match against Boston College, it would be almost expected for spirits to be down. The squad had lost in its last two outings \u2014 including an especially devastating defeat by Illinois, where the Illini won the last four matches of the game. How would the Cavaliers come out of the drought they were in? The answer seemed clear post-match \u2014 just completely dominate the Eagles. Virginia was outstanding throughout the entire day against the overmatched Boston College team, who had zero players ranked compared to Virginia\u2019s two. Not a single set was lost by the Cavaliers on any of the courts, singles or doubles. Every athlete played extremely well, but senior Gianni Ross was especially exceptional. Ross had lost his previous two matches to North Carolina and Illinois but was spectacular on Friday, defeating freshman Mason Fung in straight sets 6-0 then 6-2. Overall, this was a fantastic bounceback win for the men\u2019s tennis team as it looks to regain the momentum created earlier in the season.', 'Virginia baseball pitching can carry the day', 'Virginia baseball started its season last weekend, finishing 2-1 in a series against Connecticut. The second of those games was an ugly 10-9 loss filled with walks from both teams\u2019 pitchers, but on both Friday and Sunday, the Cavaliers\u2019 pitching practically won the games. On Friday, fans \u2014 and multiple professional scouts \u2014 were treated to a masterful performance from senior pitcher Andrew Abbott. Abbott pitched just over five innings and left with zero runs earned and just two hits. Virginia needed all of it, as they squeezed out a 2-1 victory in the opening match. On Sunday, another Cavalier starting pitcher \u2014 junior Mike Vasil \u2014 had a wonderful first outing. In six innings, he gave up just three hits and one unearned run. Vasil was also very accurate, throwing 63 strikes on just 86 pitches. It is certainly a welcome sight for the Cavaliers, who were statistically just an average pitching staff last year. Look for Virginia to keep the good momentum going into the next few games.', 'Runners left on base seem to be an early concern', 'On the offensive side, Virginia baseball did not have its best series \u2014\\xa0although that could be expected after nearly a year without an actual game. Outside of the walk-fueled nine-run outing on Saturday, the Cavaliers could only muster up six more runs through the weekend. A large part of that was the competition \u2014 the Huskies are the Big East favorites and a fringe top-25 team \u2014 but there is one stat that may be slightly troubling \u2014\\xa0runners left on base. Virginia left a whopping 28 runners stranded over the weekend, many of whom were in scoring position. The Cavaliers would have loved to see a few of those come across home plate, especially in the loss, and there was a sense of frustration at times on the field. The statistic did not come back to bite them too much, but in the ultra-competitive ACC, the Cavaliers will need to hit better with runners on base.']","371":"['Cases of COVID-19 on Grounds continue to steadily decline after last week\u2019s spike, with 26 new cases reported Wednesday.

Then, imagine a barrage of cameras following you every day capturing all your vulnerable moments. You\u2019re getting close to how Spears felt in 2007.\\xa0', 'Is it any wonder she snapped? The stigma around mental health has changed dramatically since the early 2000s. Spears needed help but was not given the proper resources. Instead, she was confined to a conservatorship run by her father, James Spears. In a conservatorship a guardian is appointed by a judge to manage the financial affairs and daily life of another due to physical or mental limitations or old age \u2014 quite unusual given that at the time, Spears was only 27 years old. To this day, Spears has no control over her finances and is under constant supervision.\\xa0', 'The #FreeBritney movement was launched on social media when longtime fans expressed their disapproval in seeing that the star was still under conservatorship at age 38. The movement strives to end the conservatorship as well as shed light on the abuse Spears suffered at the hands of the media. It serves as a reminder to recognize the countless other female starlets who have been chewed up and spit out by the Hollywood machine.\\xa0', 'Megan Fox, for example, was blacklisted for years after speaking out against director Michael Bay for sexualizing her when she was just fifteen. Janet Jackson lost work and major deals after Justin Timberlake revealed her nipple at the 2004 Super Bowl halftime show. Jackson was forced to issue a public apology after her own body was violated, while Timberlake was invited to perform the show again in 2018. Recently, 19-year-old Billie Eilish was body shamed after paparazzi pictures of her wearing a low-cut shirt surfaced. We now recoil when thinking about the conversations we were having about Britney Spears in 2004, yet they feel eerily similar to the ones we have about female celebrities today.\\xa0', 'Thus, instead of solely blaming the paparazzi, we should examine the bigger system that demands these images and places these expectations on the media in the first place. With the rise of social media, celebrities are more exposed than ever before. It is the public\u2019s responsibility to reject ignorance and misogyny and to recognize that celebrities are, in fact, people.

Through his long-form investigative work, Yager explored issues of racial inequity locally in legal, healthcare and education systems. In all aspects, he found Black individuals adversely affected.', '\u201cOpportunities were being denied and granted to children based along racial lines at a very early age, and those decisions continued all the way through school,\u201d Yager said.', 'At the heart of these setbacks was the matter of economic inequality, Yager said. The calculated cost of living for a single parent and child in Charlottesville is around $40,000 annually, without subsidies, and 22 percent of Charlottesville residents make below $35,000 a year. Of that 22 percent, white families make up 13 percent and Black families make up 54 percent.', '', '\u201cThat is a direct result of inequitable processes at work that led to what some, traditionally, have shrugged to say, \u2018This is just the way things are,\u2019\u201d Yager said.', 'Much of what Yager learned about the history of economic inequity in Charlottesville came from oral histories \u2014 meaning conversations with long-time residents of the city. Yager\u2019s goal, then, was to corroborate these stories with hard evidence, and he found a way to do so with Mapping Cville.', 'Yager received funding in 2018 from the Charlottesville Area Community Foundation to begin Mapping Cville, and since 2019, Yager has been developing a map that plots every deed that contains a racist covenant or a clause forbidding the sale of property to Black individuals and those not of white descent. Although these covenants are no longer in place, they have been found in deeds dating up to the 1940s.', '\u201cThis lot shall not be sold to any person not of the Caucasian race,\u201d one Charlottesville property deed from 1927 said.', 'The records obtained by the Mapping Cville Project span from 1888 to 1968, when the Fair Housing Act was passed, which made racial covenants illegal. But in some communities, including Charlottesville, zoning laws effectively yielded similar effects of segregation. Working through the 300,000 pages of documents from Charlottesville City and Albemarle County, 1,991 parcels of land with racist covenants have currently been mapped with the help of over 2,000 volunteers. Currently, about 87 percent of the city\u2019s records have been examined.', 'One of the earliest recorded instances of a racist covenants was found in the deeds of properties in Locust Grove in 1897 \u2014 the city\u2019s first step towards codifying segregation.', '', '\u201cThey\u2019re meant to be seen as a flag to say, \u2018White people, you can move here and not have to come into contact with Black people as neighbors,\u2019\u201d Yager said.', '1915 records showed 90 properties in Meadowbrook Hills included racist covenants.

So far, they have found a decades-long paper trail of rejected petitions from predominantly Black neighborhoods asking for quality of life improvements such as paved streets, water lines and sewer lines.', 'One key point Yager emphasized was the connection between geography and life quality. Historically white neighborhoods with racist covenants have the longest life expectancy in Charlottesville at around 81 years. Historically Black neighborhoods, neglected for generations by the local government, however, have lower life expectancies at around 75 years, Yager said.', '\u201cWhere one lives has a direct correlation to what happens to one in life,\u201d Yager said.', 'In relation to more recent history, Yager also discussed his research on stop-and-frisk \u2014 the detainment and search of an individual by police under reasonable suspicion of weapon possession or potential crime \u2014 in the city, through which he found a notable relationship between race and geography. For example, in the historically Black neighborhood of Ridge Street and Orangedale-Prospect Avenue, there were significantly more stops and frisks than in the majority-white areas of Martha Jefferson and Locust Grove.', 'Once sufficient analysis has been completed, the work of Mapping Cville will be exhibited on the first floor of the Jefferson School African American Heritage Center as a giant interactive map on-screen.', 'In March, the Mapping Albemarle project will begin, which will replicate Mapping Cville\u2019s work on Albemarle County properties.

I hadn\u2019t known that even though most artists in the past had every ability to depict figures realistically, they deliberately chose to distort or alter certain characteristics to emphasize a virtue such as fertility or beauty.

The Department of Justice and FBI thoroughly investigated the massacre, and it was in a federal courtroom in 2014 that four Blackwater security guards were convicted for their involvement in these heinous acts. But thanks to the 45th President of the United States, all four war criminals have received full pardons. To say that former President Donald J. Trump showed a blatant disregard for human rights would be an understatement. The past four years have seen the United States withdraw from the Human Rights Council, sanction the International Criminal Court and turn a blind eye to the dismemberment of a journalist. This sickening dereliction of duty poses significant challenges for the new administration, yet it is incumbent upon President Joseph R. Biden Jr. to demonstrate to the global community that the United States still values human rights.', 'Thankfully, then-candidate Biden told the New York Times that \u201chuman rights will be at the core of U.S. foreign policy.\u201d This determination is both refreshing and in increasing demand globally. As Biden embarks on the first days of his presidency, the administration will need to develop responses towards a plethora of growing humanitarian crises including the genocide of the Rohingya, Chinese repression of Uighurs and the growth of authoritarianism. It is very unlikely that Biden will be a panacea for all the evils and ills that currently confront the world. However, at a minimum, an administration with the gumption to lodge meaningful and spirited rebukes against the worst human rights abusers will help set a standard that such acts are not to be tolerated.', 'Despite the absence of American leadership over the past four years, some nations have taken up the mantle of international human rights. These strides will greatly aid the Biden administration in its attempts to advance global accountability. Countries such as Belgium and Spain have increasingly used the principle of universal jurisdiction to arrest and try human rights abusers. Additionally, nations have turned to the International Court of Justice as an avenue to charge entire governments for crimes against humanity. These developments will hopefully inspire a sense of cautious optimism amongst the Biden foreign policy team should they seek to reshape American diplomacy into a force for global good.\\xa0', 'If Biden\u2019s respect for human rights is genuine, he has a broad set of policy options at his disposal. America is an economic juggernaut, giving it substantial influence over the internal affairs of other countries. The Biden administration should harness this power to punish human rights abusers and reward those who make improvements. This can be accomplished by making arms sales and foreign aid contingent upon a recipient nation\u2019s adherence to international law and democratic reforms. Given that the largest recipients of such aid are nations like Nigeria, Saudi Arabia and Egypt \u2014 which are not necessarily bastions of civil liberty \u2014 conditional aid has the potential to better the lives of millions of people residing under repressive regimes. While such a policy of withholding aid may appear callous to the citizens of these countries, much of U.S. aid spending is in the form of military assistance. Furthermore, the aid that is actually allotted for humanitarian purposes is likely to be siphoned off by corrupt officials in recipient countries.\\xa0', 'In some respects, the Biden administration will be hamstrung in its foreign policy endeavours due to the tenuous grip the Democrats have over Congress. For instance, it is unlikely that the United States will sign the Rome Statute, which would bring the United States under the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court, or that aid to strategic allies \u2014 regardless of how dismal their human rights situation may be \u2014 will experience crippling cuts. Still, the Biden administration will have several avenues open to them that they can and must explore.\\xa0', 'First, the administration can start by rejoining the Human Rights Council when given the opportunity in 2022. In this capacity, the United States will have the chance to stymie the influence of the authoritarian Chinese government over the Council. Additionally, the United States will have a say in the assignment of the Council\u2019s Special Procedures mandate holders who are tasked with investigating a variety of human rights abuses. Beyond rejoining the Human Rights Council, the Biden administration should extend support to the International Criminal Court, UN-backed courts and other countries in their attempts to prosecute human rights abusers. Taken individually, none of these actions will monumentally shift the global landscape. However, consistent messaging and policy will allow the United States to rebuild its reputation by showing the world that we are firmly on the side of the persecuted and not the persecutors.\\xa0', 'Max Bresticker is an Opinion Columnist for The Cavalier Daily.

Although her resume is quite impressive, what is most magical about Taylor\u2019s work is her unique contemporary style and the creative movement vocabulary she has established through her choreography.\\xa0', 'Last week, Taylor worked with the dance program under the Department of Drama at the University. As part of her time at the University through a week-long residency, she held a virtual Artist Talk on Friday for dancers and non-dancers alike that preceded two days of masterclasses. At the talk, she was introduced by Kim Brooks Mata, the head of the dance program at the University, and began her talk by discussing how her career in dance developed.\\xa0', 'Taylor grew up in Omaha, Nebraska, where she was trained primarily in ballet. She then went to the Ailey School in New York City and began doing commercial work. Eventually, Taylor moved back to Nebraska where she started choreographing and caught what she referred to as the \u201cchoreography bug.\u201d She developed her skills and style before settling down in New Orleans where she now concentrates on both commercial and concert work. Taylor has been able to worked with artists like OneRepublic, Arcade Fire, SZA, and Solange Knowles and has worked on many other TV, movie, music video and commercial projects.\\xa0', 'Throughout her career, Taylor focused on developing and evolving her choreography and creative voice. She started with concert dance choreography. She has a deep love for contemporary and modern dance, but she was forced to retrain and adapt to the more commercial styles\u2014like jazz and hip hop\u2014when she began her commercial choreography around 2016.', 'Taylor also compared her views on concert dance\u2014which is more artistic and performed in theaters \u2014 and commercial dance \u2014 which is entertainment-based and focuses on dance in productions like film and television.', 'In the concert dance world, Taylor said that one has \u201cmore agency and you do have more freedom\u201d to create their own works, but she loves \u201cthe challenge of adding my creative voice\u201d to commercial works. She explained how her creations for concert dance are always more serious as this choreography can focus on artistry and less about the entertainment factor. She also felt as though she had to impress her instructors and peers but, simultaneously, she felt more freedom to create based on her own style. On the other hand, commercial work allowed less room for creativity as she was hired to create a specific vision, but she confronted this limit as a challenge to create something that matched the vision of both the director and herself.\\xa0', 'When the floor opened up to questions, Taylor described her emotions before COVID-19 to put the pandemic in context. She explained how she was always prepared for the physical and technical side of dance as an occupation but did not anticipate the mental side of the industry. Dealing with the anxiety of auditions and working multiple jobs for financial stability was something she confronted early on, but when the pandemic hit, her thoughts shifted to the anxiety of not knowing when she\u2019d be able to dance again. She explains that even though commercial dance is starting to regain momentum, unfortunately, dance is going to be slow coming back because it requires so many bodies on set.', 'In the time of COVID-19, however, Taylor finds she has to \u201cinspire even more\u201d than she has when she\u2019s in a real space.', '\u201cWe have to remind ourselves why we are doing this,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cWe need each other to do this.\u201d', 'With the restrictions caused by the pandemic, Taylor along with other choreographers \u2014 and the rest of the world \u2014 have turned to Zoom for virtual classes and rehearsals. As part of her residency with the Dance Program, Taylor held two virtual masterclasses over the weekend. In the classes, she focused on a variety of improvisation and choreographic techniques.\\xa0', 'One of these techniques focused on breath, both in warm-up and in choreography. Using breath allows movement to flow more naturally throughout the body.', 'Another technique challenged the traditional training of most dancers. She focused on ways to change and develop the basic movements dancers learn early on, like pli\u00e9s and tendus. Finally, she emphasized the importance of articulating every movement in both choreography and improvisation.\\xa0', 'Taylor\u2019s choreographic phrase continued these themes. She gave the dancers different prompts and challenged them to change the dynamics of the choreography \u2014 playing with minuscule, medium and large movements. The class discussed these changing dynamics and found that larger movement allowed more freedom and smaller movement required more stylistic choices. Comprehensively, the masterclasses highlighted a sense of self-awareness that is required of dancers in both the class setting and professional setting.\\xa0', '\u201cTake notice of what your body can and can\u2019t do,\u201d Taylor said.\\xa0', 'Overall, Maya Taylor shared her experiences and creativity in an interactive way. She has found her own path in the dance industry by developing her own choreographic style and now collaborates \u2014 even if through Zoom \u2014 with various dancers and creators. She described how thankful she is that people have watched her work and want to see it combined with theirs. But throughout her experience, she learned that it\u2019s the dancer\u2019s story that really matters.\\xa0', '\u201cI never want a dancer to feel like they have to diminish their personality,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cIt\u2019s their story to tell.\u201d']","397":"['No. 10 Virginia men\u2019s swimming and diving wrapped up their week of ACC Championship competition in Greensboro, N.

As a result of differing schedules due to COVID-19, many fall sports elected to have conference championships in the spring, so Cavalier fans are treated with the rarity of teams from all three seasons playing at the same time. Men\u2019s swim and dive finished fourth at the ACC Championships, while men\u2019s and women\u2019s track and field finished seventh and third, respectively. Squash, volleyball and men\u2019s and women\u2019s tennis all posted wins this week, while men\u2019s lacrosse and men\u2019s soccer both lost. To finish, fans were treated with a great weekend at the diamond, where baseball and softball each split series. Let\u2019s take a closer look with five takeaways from Virginia sports.', 'Virginia men\u2019s basketball has become over reliant on three-pointers', 'This is not a typical Tony Bennett-coached team. Instead of the vaunted pack-line defense carrying the day, Virginia basketball counts on its offense to win games, which is a bit of a culture shock as opposed to the past few seasons. And when that offense doesn\u2019t show up, games like the Cavaliers\u2019 68-61 loss to NC State happen. Virginia started off ice cold from the field, leading to a 24-10 deficit in the first half. Despite coming back to take their first lead of the game in the middle of the second period, the Cavaliers\u2019 shooting failed them. Virginia shot just 28 percent from beyond the arc, and everyone besides senior forward Sam Hauser was practically nonexistent from three. Jay Huff had an excellent game when he got the ball, but there simply were too many times when Huff had a matchup advantage and ended up watching a three get jacked up with six seconds on the shot clock. The Cavaliers simply take too many three-point attempts and get burned when shots don\u2019t fall. Combine that with suspect defense once again, and the loss to the Wolfpack suddenly isn\u2019t so surprising.\\xa0', 'Rotations on defense continue to hurt the Cavaliers', 'Speaking of suspect defense, the 68-61 score may have been a tad deceiving in terms of the defensive effort by Virginia basketball. There were multiple points throughout the game where the audience could see Bennett shaking his head after miscues on the side of the ball Virginia is known for. A large portion of the easy buckets NC State got throughout the game came from rotational errors by the Cavaliers, particularly on plays initiated from the low block. A quintessential pillar of the pack-line defense is the scheme of double-teaming the ball if it reaches the post player. This scheme is designed to create panic passes from the ball handler, as big men are typically not known for their passing vision. Ideally, one of the three other defenders would then steal the ball for a fast break the other way. Unfortunately for Virginia, not many of those ideal scenarios came to fruition. Part of the problem is a testament to the Wolfpack big men, who made smart passes that led to easy points. But more often than not, a missed assignment by the other defenders gave NC State an out from the double team and an advantage for the rest of the possession. Bennett will undoubtedly focus in on rotations in practice in the coming days.', 'Possession control was key for women\u2019s lacrosse', 'Virginia women\u2019s lacrosse opened conference play Saturday with a hard-earned rivalry win over Virginia Tech. The 12th-ranked Cavaliers outlasted the 15th-ranked Hokies 12-10 in a match that was tight throughout the game. What won it for Virginia was its ability to control possessions, especially at opportune moments. The Cavaliers\u2019 expertise was shown specifically during draws, where Virginia won an incredible 68 percent of draw controls in the match. \\xa0As a result of starting with the ball so often, the Cavaliers were able to overcome a few deficiencies during the game, such as struggling with turnovers and free positions. But when it mattered most, Virginia won the last four draws, effectively running out the clock on an outstanding game by both teams. Look for Virginia to carry the momentum through to another match with a Commonwealth opponent in George Mason next week.', 'The youth of Cavalier softball is getting more comfortable', 'After a sub-.500 start to the season, Virginia softball had a strong weekend at the Cavalier Invite, going 3-1 overall against James Madison and George Washington. It seems from the recent surge that the youth on the Cavalier softball team is settling into being the main components of the squad. With just one senior regularly in the starting lineup, a lot of the athletes have needed a bit of time to settle in. Junior Donna Friedman has been particularly impressive, with the catcher starting off the year batting .378. Another bright spot in the lineup on Sunday was junior Emma McBride, who earned the first start of her season, going 2-3 with a double in the fifth inning that she eventually scored off of. Overall, the Cavaliers are starting to see a bright nucleus of young players come into their own, and the Cavalier Invite may have been a starting point.', 'The softball team\u2019s pitching has been a strong point so far', 'What did not need any time to warm up was the Cavaliers\u2019 pitching. The unit has given up more than five runs just once this season \u2014 \\xa0a welcome sign to the offense that has been struggling to get going at times. In the second game of the doubleheader on Sunday, Virginia had one of its best outings of the season, defeating George Washington 3-1.

In the second, sophomore infielder Max Cotier hit a ball that would bounce off the ground, leaving ample time for sophomore outfielder Chris Newell to run in and plate another run.

The novel is structured like a Catholic Saints\u2019 Day book, but Randall noted it is centered on the virtues of secular saints.', 'Before beginning her discussion of the novel, Randall dedicated her presentation to Sally Hemings, an enslaved person owned by Thomas Jefferson and mother to several of his children. She later explained this choice by reminding the audience that trauma is woven into America\u2019s founding, as 41 of the 56 signers of the Declaration of Independence owned enslaved workers.

With their help, Tseng has made this dual-university collaboration a possibility as she teaches this course alongside Dr. Ziyi Geng, Lecturer of Chinese at the University.\\xa0', 'Tseng had a vision to create an innovative and technology-driven course. She drew from her many years of experience as the director and creator of STARTALK, a government-funded, online curriculum at the University. STARTALK provides Chinese teachers and students with the technology and immersion opportunities needed to enhance their language skills.\\xa0', 'She spent several months and long hours developing this new program in 2020, funded by a grant she was awarded from The Daniels Family NEH Distinguished Teaching Professorship. Moreover, since the Distinguished Teaching Professorship is a three-year appointment, the course will continue to be offered for the next two spring semesters.\\xa0', 'Speaking on the overall goals of the course, Tseng notes that her experience with incorporating community-based learning approaches started from her CHIN 3010 class from the fall of 2018, and that sentiment has flowed into this semester\u2019s CHIN 3020 course with the help of curated technological assistance.', '\u201cThe technology-mediated and task-based course is designed to create opportunities for learners to immerse in real-world and digital authenticity,\u201d Tseng said.\\xa0', 'As an education technology coordinator at the University\u2019s STARTALK since 2017, Dr. Yan Gao joined Tseng in her efforts to create an immersive and enriching new curriculum for students. Gao\u2019s primary responsibility involves bringing effective technology into the classroom. These include interactive flyers on ThingLink with embedded Chinese cultural videos, 3D virtual reality immersion videos through interactive virtual platforms like Playposit and e-portfolio platforms like Book Creator that allow students to share images and audio recordings with one another.\\xa0', 'When asked about her hopes for the program and the benefits of incorporating advanced technology into the classroom, Gao explains that the technology provides students with an active learning experience from a virtual setting.\\xa0', '\u201cThe course prepares students to enrich their understanding of the language and gives them the confidence to speak Chinese through constant practice with Beijing students,\u201d Gao said. \\xa0\u201cThe 3D virtual reality video makes the students feel like they are really on a virtual trip.\u201d\\xa0', 'On the first day of class, students participated in a pre-departure information session and orientation where they virtually \u201cpacked their bags\u201d for the trip and got ready for takeoff.

In class, students were divided into breakout rooms to discuss their final decisions and voted on their favorite Airbnb choice in the final minutes of class.', 'This type of immersive experience is likewise implemented in various forms throughout the curriculum. For example, in a later unit that asked students to explore student life at Peking University, Professors Tseng and Geng invited Peking University graduate student Yu Meng to attend one of the online class sessions for a Q&A session. There, students were able to ask a variety of questions in order to learn more about the typical perspectives and activities of a Peking University student.\\xa0', 'Throughout each two-week learning unit, students have the opportunity to meet with native speakers from the University\u2019s Chinese language department.

As a Black person, I know this fear very well first-hand. In fact, in the beginning of lockdown in the country, I had a conversation with a family member in which we both said if a vaccine came out, \u201cWe ain\u2019t getting it.\u201d The legacy of racist medical malpractice such as the Tuskegee Study, the Henrietta Lacks case and many other cases of how Black people have been treated \u2014 and in many cases still are treated \u2014 has made us skeptical. Despite this, we know being vaccinated is a vital step in helping the country slow the spread and protect those around us.', 'It is imperative to note that vaccine hesitancy among Black Americans is not an anti-vaxxer stance. The root of many Black American\u2019s mistrust is not because we don\u2019t believe in vaccines. Simply put, a lot of us don\u2019t trust a public health system that has in too many cases engaged in intentional harm to Black bodies when it comes to experimentation, neglect and so on. As of January, only a little over five percent of those who received a vaccine were Black, compared to 60 percent who were white. In addition to this, 35 percent of Black Americans have said they do not plan on receiving the vaccine. To fully understand our hesitancy, you must understand the history of racism in medicine.\\xa0', 'You must consider cases like how doctors at Johns Hopkins University took cancer cells from a dying Black woman named Henrietta Lacks without her consent. They, along with other companies who profited, used those cells to create what would become a multimillion-dollar line of biological research. Moreover, for decades afterwards, they neglected to pass monetary compensation to Lacks\u2019 descendants and continued to not ask for their consent in the handling of her case. They revealed Lacks\u2019 name publicly, gave her medical records to the media and even published her cells\u2019 genome online without consulting her family.\\xa0', 'The most pertinent representation of racism in medicine is the Tuskegee syphilis study, which is also possibly one of the best-known cases of the government taking advantage of the Black body. The U.S. Public Health Service sponsored an experiment from 1932 to 1972, where hundreds of Black men with syphilis were given placebos instead of actual medicine or effective care so that doctors could document the long-term progression of the disease. Many of the men died or developed other serious health issues even though they were promised proper treatment in participating in the study.\\xa0', 'The men were lured into the experiment under abhorrent false pretenses, while the real purpose of the study was to learn whether untreated syphilis progressed differently in Black people compared with white people. This idea \u2014 suggesting Black people are less than human and inferior compared to whites \u2014 has deep ties with racial maltreatment in medicine today. It is the root of why Black people are often given different treatment based on the way they are perceived \u2014 whether it be a higher pain tolerance or assumed tendency to exaggerate. These issues alone are evidence enough as to why the Black community\u2019s hesitantancy is valid when it comes to receiving the COVID-19 vaccine.', 'There are other factors that play into our hesitancy as well. When you add in concerns of future issues or allergic reactions, along with misinformation, it is imperative that we do our due diligence to remain accurately informed in order to make the best decision for ourselves. Among this, many Black Americans who do plan to get the vaccine are just waiting to see how well it is working in and affecting other people before they get it themselves. Even with these concerns, it remains that our skepticism goes deeper than any level of misinformation or lack of proper information. On top of the Tuskegee study and Henrietta Lacks cases, we have seen the Black maternal mortality rate, the stories of medical neglect in this pandemic and the practice of eugenics \u2014 a history that our University is not immune to. The combination of racism in medicine, misinformation and health concerns are what make up our hesitancy.', 'There are many cases of racially charged medical malpractice throughout history and in the present \u2014 especially since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. It is not hard to see and understand why many Black Americans are hesitant to receive a vaccine due to this mistrust that has built up over the long history of racism in medicine. While our hesitancy is valid \u2014 and should provoke the U.S. healthcare system to address its history of medical racism \u2014 we also have to recognize that this vaccine is an opportunity to protect ourselves and others from a virus that has set many of our lives off track. We have certainly felt the effect of the pandemic, considering Black people have the second highest number of recorded coronavirus deaths. The vaccine has gone through many clinical trials and has been deemed safe for the general public. As a student currently on Grounds, it seems my time to be vaccinated will not come for a little while, but when it does, I will be more than ready to do my part.', 'Aliyah D.

With over 28 million infections and 500,000 deaths, the United States has struggled more than any other country with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to having the largest number of reported cases and deaths, this past year has exposed the volatility of American politics. Our country recently witnessed an unprecedented attack on the Capitol Building \u2014 an event which will almost certainly be studied for decades to come \u2014 incited by none other than the former President Donald Trump. Prior to that, Trump had been traveling the country convincing his supporters \u2014 more than 80 percent of whom agreed \u2014 that the election was rigged. Before the election, COVID-19 had exposed America\u2019s problem with racial and economic inequality, as low-income and non-white Americans have been hit the hardest. Furthermore, the pandemic has revealed our hyper-partisanship \u2014 there continues to remain a lack of consensus on how best to handle the crisis. While 2020 certainly revealed a lot, perhaps more than anything, it showed that it is time to get rid of the myth of American exceptionalism.', 'American exceptionalism is the idea that America is not just unique, but also inherently better than other countries. The idea is particularly popular within conservative circles, where the claim that \u201cAmerica is the greatest country on Earth\u201d is seen more as a triumphant reaffirmation of what is already known than a statement subject to objective analysis. This attitude has become synonymous with supposedly patriotic thinking in America, and it stems from the fact that America was founded on Enlightenment principles, including the freedoms of speech, religion, self-governance and due process.\\xa0', 'As Americans, we have a lot to be proud of when it comes to our country\u2019s history, and in certain ways, America truly is exceptional. America was uniquely founded on a set of lofty ideals. However, throughout much of its history, these principles were denied to most Americians on the basis of race and sex. So while we can celebrate our country\u2019s founding vision, we should not make the mistake of assuming that our country has ever fully lived up to these ideals. Even now, America is far from perfect, and we should be constantly fighting to ensure that America upholds its promises to everyone.', 'More importantly though, whether or not America is exceptional is a current \u2014 not historical \u2014 question. It may be true that America was exceptional compared to its peers 250 years ago, but that does not matter if the current reality is different \u2014 which it is. When it comes to what matters most \u2014 standard of living, life expectancy, self-reported happiness, incarceration rates, social mobility and even freedom itself \u2014 America is exceptionally unexceptional. America does not rank in the top ten for any of these, except for incarceration \u2014 where the U.S. unfortunately ranks first, largely due to its history of systemic racism. The failed response to the pandemic is yet another example of how America has failed to live up to its peers.', 'As Americans, there are two ways we can respond to this problem. The first is to stick our heads in the sand, denying that a problem exists and continuing to live with the delusory belief that our country will always be the best. This is the path American exceptionalists take, and it all but ensures that America will continue to do worse than its peers. The second response is to look objectively at the problems America faces and to deal with them accordingly. Doing so requires that we consider the possibility that America is currently not better than other countries.\\xa0', 'Ironically, American exceptionalism is the greatest obstacle to America actually being exceptional. It fosters complacency rooted in ignorance, and it stifles the desire to create positive change. After all, if America is and always will be the best, then why bother to address its problems? Those who believe that America is the best country in the world are unlikely to be aware of the problems it faces and are therefore incapable of taking the proper steps to solve them.\\xa0', 'Currently, it is considered patriotic to blindly cling to the notion that America is inherently superior to every other nation, but it really shouldn\u2019t be. If patriotism is loving one\u2019s country, then caring about one\u2019s country enough to try to improve it is the most patriotic thing one can do. While it is comforting to believe that your country is inherently better, it is ultimately at odds with actually making this a reality. As Americans, we should love our country and fellow citizens enough to face the harsh reality that the U.S. has deeply-rooted flaws which currently prevent it from truly being the greatest country in the world. I believe that we can overcome these, provided that our country begins reckoning with its own faults and shortcomings.', 'Sam Mattingly is an Opinion Columnist for The Cavalier Daily.

The twelve-track record is by no means mindless background music \u2014 it demands the attention of the listener. Set to radio rock choruses and, at times, triumphant soaring vocals, this album still features Baker\u2019s signature heart-wrenching lyrics.', \"Baker, a Tennessee native, uses a full band of sorts in \u201cLittle Oblivions\u201d \u2014\\xa0although it\u2019s really a one-woman show. Baker plays a myriad of instruments on this album \u2014 alongside her go-to guitar and keyboard, we hear her playing bass, banjo, mandolin and drums. Certainly, a sonic step-up from her 2015 album, \u201cSprained Ankle,\u201d and 2017\u2019s \u201cTurn Out the Lights,\u201d Baker uses \u201cLittle Oblivions'' as a chance to push back against the arc of positivity and redemption she laid out for herself in her first two albums. The 25-year-old has been open about her struggles with substance abuse as a teen, and her latest release gives her the freedom to explore the pain and frustration of relapse. Baker also writes about her experiences as a queer woman growing up in the Christian Church and experiencing doubt.\", 'Every song on \u201cLittle Oblivions\u201d has a moment \u2014\\xa0multiple in some tracks \u2014 where the ground drops out from beneath you and you plummet into a soundscape of doubt and sorrow. That being said, it\u2019s not all sad. Those moments often are often attached to an almost ecstatic understanding of Baker\u2019s pain. To call the album simply sad or depressing \u2014 or \u201csad girl indie,\u201d a label Baker and her boygenius bandmate Lucy Dacus have pushed back against \u2014 \\xa0would be to erase the power and strength that comes from accepting doubt, failure and frustration as part of one\u2019s emotional, physical and spiritual journey.', 'On the first listen, each song sounds like it could be the ending track to the album. This exhaustive yet cathartic repetition is perhaps on purpose \u2014 mimicking the emotional rollercoaster that comes with addiction, struggles with religion, grief and heartbreak. Some might say that Baker\u2019s entire discography is a discussion of these key issues. The repeat themes we see on \u201cLittle Oblivions\u201d are not used to glamorize or romanticize sorrow \u2014 the repetition is just a symptom of the struggle itself. As Baker said in an interview with Stereogum, \u201cI don\u2019t want to sensationalize these [bleak periods]. These are experiences that I\u2019ve written about before because they\u2019re similar to experiences that I had in childhood and teenage-dom.\u201d 2019 proved to be a difficult year for Baker and her struggle with substance abuse. \u201cLittle Oblivions\u201d is an exercise in exploring those bleak experiences and the nonlinear cycle of recovery.\\xa0', 'Baker\u2019s lyrical prowess is undeniable, but for those familiar with the sound of her first two albums and her collaboration with Phoebe Bridgers and Lucy Dacus in boygenius, this album might almost feel overproduced. This new full-band and at times synthetic sound will definitely translate well to on-stage and live performances. But \u201cLittle Oblivions\u201d does not really seem to be catering to Baker\u2019s audience, or any audience for that matter. It is Baker\u2019s experiment in unapologetically exploring her own struggles.\\xa0', 'There\u2019s still a piece of Baker that worries about isolation in her sorrow, even as she owns up to her experiences. That worry wars with her self-deprecation. She asks in \u201cFavor\u201d \u2014 with backup vocals from her boygenius bandmates \u2014 \u201cHow long do I have until \/ I\u2019ve spent up everyone\u2019s goodwill?\u201d Immediately after, in \u201cSong in E,\u201d she sings, \u201cGive me no sympathy \/ It\u2019s the mercy I can\u2019t take.\"', 'The doubt and spiritual frustration that weave through this album humanize the experience of recovery. \u201cLittle Oblivions\u201d intentionally removes Baker from any pedestal she might have originally been put on as a poster child for queer artists, those recovering from substance abuse or even \u201cprogressive Christians.\u201d This is clear in the call and response between \u201cRelative Fiction\u201d and \u201cZiptie\u201d when Baker sings, \u201cI don\u2019t need a savior \/ I need you to take me home\u201d then \u201cGood God \/ When you gonna call it off? \/ Climb down off of the cross \/ And change your mind?\u201d\\xa0', '\u201cLittle Oblivions\u201d and Baker escape genre and any sort of overly optimistic redemption arc. Baker lets the negatives in life breathe, and in turn frees herself. In this poetic, experimental album we learn alongside Baker that accepting doubt can become an ecstatic experience.

Only those who know how blinding it is can understand how it affects other artists.

In addition to accepting physical turmoil for the sake of art, she also struggles with Tourette\u2019s Syndrome.

She confides in her fans about self-harm, showing the darkest thoughts of her younger self written in her journal.\\xa0', 'Self-inflicted and external pressures weigh artists down and awaken their inner demons.

However, all I could see was mockery \u2014 from the exaggerated bodily movements of the protagonist, to the overwhelmingly bright lights and flashing colors, to her caregiver\u2019s use of the prone restraint. I felt the kind of shame I experienced as a child, when classmates would mock my flapping hands and unusual speech \u2014 someone was mocking me and people like me again. While \u201cMusic\u201d has received widespread criticism from Autistic people and film reviewers alike, it is still the symptom of a troubling cultural trend. This trend, led by neurotypical-run groups like Autism Speaks, portrays Autistic people as pitiable burdens, who need a cure above all \u2014 rather than the acceptance and accommodation Autistic people have advocated for over decades.', 'Autism is a developmental disability that affects how one navigates and interacts with the world.

I am opposed to \u201ccures\u201d for Autism for many reasons \u2014 but not least among them is the ableist notion that someone is essentially separable from their disability. When people seek to \u2018fight\u2019 Autism or to \u2018cure\u2019 it, they do so from a position in which the essential nature of an Autistic person \u2014 who they \u201creally are\u201d \u2014 is neurotypical.', 'Because of this, Autism is framed as a kind of appendage, a monster devouring the perfect \u2018normal\u2019 child \u2014 and yes, these conversations are almost always had about Autistic children as if they do not turn into Autistic adults. Thus, the monstrous disability needs to be fought, battled, and removed from the person it inhabits. However, this reasoning is deeply flawed. I was born Autistic, the way my brain sees the world is autistic and my essential self can no more be separated from Autism than it can from my gender, race or any other immutable identity. Thus, curing me would result in the end of me. Not only do I not want to be cured and cannot be cured, but a version of myself without Autism is not myself \u2014 just as a male version or a straight version of me is not really me.', 'As an Autistic person, cure-based rhetoric is deeply troubling. From Sia\u2019s new film, to Autism Speaks, to the Virginia Institute of Autism\u2019s single-minded focus on Applied Behavioral Analysis \u2014 a controversial approach described by many Autistic people as akin to conversion therapy \u2014 treating Autism is harmful to Autistic people and prevents them from receiving the help they really need. Like many other disability rights movements, the neurodiversity movement argues that Autistic people need access to support, accommodation and acceptance, not the eradication of their disability.', 'Autism is a disability, but like many others in the Autistic community, I firmly believe that this disabled experience is intrinsically valuable. Yes, an Autistic life is more challenging than a neurotypical life, but so is a female life, a Black life, a gay life. There are a myriad of ways in which lives can be made more or less challenging by various identity categories. However, just because these challenges exist does not mean that those living with them lack inherently valuable experiences. In fact, most Autistic people find their lives to be worthwhile because of their disability, not despite it. Further, the root of these challenges is not difference itself, but rather societal response to difference. Therefore, the answer to disabilities like Autism is acceptance, and the breakdown of prejudice and prejudicial systems, not the end of Autism itself.', 'Autistic people, from those with lower support needs like myself to those with much higher support needs \u2014 like non-speaking autistic activist and poet Amy Sequenzia, and the late advocate Mel Baggs \\xa0\u2014 are adamant that our lives are not full of endless suffering. In fact, we take pride in our Autistic way of processing the world. Yes, we need support and accessibility \u2014 but once those needs are met, Autistic people have lives as full and rich as anyone else\u2019s. The idea that Autism is an \u201cepidemic\u201d \u2014 espoused by organizations like Autism Speaks \u2014 is ridiculous. First, one must bear in mind that Autism is not a disease, but rather a mostly genetic condition that one is born with. Second, Autistic people do not find their experiences to be lesser than the neurotypical alternative.\\xa0', 'Thus, when films like \u201cMusic\u201d attempt to tell stories about Autistic people without consulting any of us actually living with the condition, the work that results is inherently flawed and often incredibly insulting. When our attention, time and donation dollars go to so-called charities like Autism Speaks \u2014 which remain deeply invested in eradicating Autistic experience from the world, and painting Autistic people as subhuman \u2014 we guarantee that Autistic people will remain disenfranchised and unheard. Next time, before you attempt Autism advocacy without consulting Autistic voices, remember the slogan of the Autistic Self Advocacy Network \u2014 \u201cNothing About Us, Without Us.\u201d', 'Emma Camp is an Opinion Columnist for The Cavalier Daily.

And I could tell that he was like, kind of goofy already which made me a little bit more comfortable going into the date.\u201d\\xa0', 'Upon meeting, the two discovered mutual interests and discussed their commonalities.\\xa0', \"\u201cI didn't know him at all, so I didn't really know he was from London. We talked about that upbringing and his weird psycho boarding school \u2014 like not that psycho, but just the boarding schools in London that are kind of crazy and whatnot,\u201d Grace said. The two bonded over their upbringings in big cities and their inability to drive, which they justified by agreeing that other students at the University are embarrassingly incapable of walking to places.\\xa0\", 'Grace also noted that the two share a love for Via-riding \u2014 a low-cost ride sharing platform \u2014 and additionally spent much of their conversation discussing food, specifically Alex\u2019s culinary skills and his chef Instagram account. \\xa0', '\u201cI think we both very quickly knew that we like to travel, which is pretty cool,\u201d Alex said. \u201cAnd she wants to go abroad, and I took a gap year, so traveling was quite a nice thing to talk about. We also spoke about our love of food and picked out a few other restaurants in town, which we think could be quite cool [to visit].\u201d\\xa0', 'When I asked about the details of the date that stood out, Grace noted that although Alex \u201carrived\u201d to their Zoom date before she did, \u201che was a little bit hot at first \u2014 like in his actual temperature.

But we had a good time and a good laugh.\u201d\\xa0', 'While that statement may make it seem like they have a propensity for the negative, I gathered that it spoke more to the pair\u2019s mutually sharp \u2014 and at times dark \u2014 senses of humor, which lent itself to their steady flow of banter.\\xa0', 'Unlike previous Love Connection dates where the telling content or red flags may arise from funny food orders and awkward entrances, the most significant aspect of virtual dates is perhaps the simple willingness to go on one. While I couldn\u2019t ask them about who paid the check or the nuances of their body language, I was most interested in how their date felt relative to COVID and isolation. The two confirmed their satisfaction when they experienced what many of us might be craving at this point in the pandemic \u2014 a rare and valuable opportunity to meet someone new.\\xa0', \"\u201cIt's really nice just to talk to someone that you actually don't know at all and to hear someone's story and just connect with someone and have that spontaneity,\u201d Grace said. \u201cI feel like with Corona you are kind of just forced to only connect with the people you already have a connection with, so it's exciting to have that little spark of new connection that we're really missing during this time. And it\u2019s nice just feeling like you vibe with someone, especially since we're not really meeting that many people and those acquaintances or first interactions with people are very much stunted right now.\u201d\", \"Alex added that \u201cit's refreshing to meet new people who you wouldn't get to meet because of the restrictions. It's like a slice of normality in a chaotic world. And obviously it's a bit weird doing things on Zoom, you know if you have your technical problems, internet, WiFi, all that kind of stuff. But it definitely allows you to escape, not in the sense of a holiday, but it\u2019s like a little oasis of interpersonal connection, which no one has had in I don\u2019t know how long, almost a year.\u201d\", 'Not only did they appreciate simply connecting with someone new, but they each disclosed that they thought the other was \u201creally cool.\u201d When I inquired about a second date, Grace said she\u2019d \u201cbe down to hit up some of the food spots he was talking about,\u201d while Alex revealed he\u2019s \u201cthinking about Jack Brown\u2019s, we might head over there.\u201d', 'Finally, in terms of their experience with Love Connection, both said they would recommend the platform.\\xa0', '\u201cI\u2019ve already signed up a lot of my friends,\u201d Alex assured me. Grace concluded, \u201cI feel like it\u2019s a great chance to meet people and get along with someone, and if you don\u2019t [get along], then you have a funny story to tell, and maybe a new enemy, so it\u2019s a win-win.\u201d\\xa0', 'Grace and Alex were able to go on an in-person, second date on the evening of Feb. 25 by sharing a Via ride to Jack Brown\u2019s.

Classified as a \u201chybrid system\u201d by the National Conference of State Legislatures, the oldest democratic governing body in the Western Hemisphere only convenes for a month or two, depending on the numbered year. Most legislators have second jobs in their off-season, as the income from their legislative seat is not sufficient to cover a full year of living expenses.', 'The 2021 Legislative Session was one of the most important in recent memory. Convening Jan. 13, lawmakers met in the aftermath of the domestic terrorist attack on the Capitol and amid an ongoing attempt by former President Donald Trump and Congressional Republicans to overturn the results of a free and fair election. On the docket this session were issues of racial justice, coronavirus relief and economic support, gun reform and marijuana legalization.\\xa0', 'Despite the unprecedented context and dire issues at hand, Virginia\u2019s government sprinted toward the end of the session Feb. 27 \u2014 just 46 days after it began. While the originally scheduled 30-day session could have been extended up to a total of 60 days \u2014 as has been the case every year since 1971 \u2014 the Virginia GOP torpedoed the plan in November last year. The GOP\u2019s refusal to extend the session is almost certainly tied to an effort to undermine Democrats ahead of the 2021 gubernatorial race, and it has dire consequences for Virginians. A shorter session means it\u2019s more difficult to pass desperately needed legislation such as aid packages for coronavirus vaccine distribution or reopening schools.', 'This isn\u2019t the first time the Virginia GOP has weaponized the General Assembly for political gain. In the wake of the Virginia Beach mass shooting in 2019, Governor Northam convened a special legislative session to formulate and pass gun reform in the Commonwealth. Republicans \u2014 then in control of the legislature \u2014 adjourned after 90 minutes and with zero pieces of legislation entertained.\\xa0', 'The GOP\u2019s political theater tactics would not have been a concern if the General Assembly was full-time. The legislative session would be year-round, and extensions or special sessions would not be necessary.\\xa0', 'The part-time nature of the General Assembly is intended to preserve a citizen legislature. The thought goes that if legislators work regular jobs and live as regular citizens in addition to their role as legislators, they will be closer to their constituents and have a better understanding of what the Commonwealth needs. This sounds rosey on paper, but citizen legislatures are insufficient for the contemporary period. Plenty of legislators are already experts in their respective fields and translate this expertise into their policymaking, but they are forced to legislate on a timer. Removing the timer \u2014 making the General Assembly a year-round job \u2014 will allow them to focus more thoroughly on policy and the Commonwealth\u2019s future.\\xa0', 'Concerns over elevated costs for a year-round General Assembly \u2014 including higher salaries for lawmakers \u2014 are easily addressed. The Commonwealth is constitutionally required to have a balanced budget each fiscal year, and our current budget surplus is approximately $730 million. Expanding the term of the General Assembly to cover most of the calendar year would not result in significant financial strain on the Commonwealth or its budget.', 'Additionally and more importantly, the General Assembly must meet year-round so that legislators can quickly address issues critical to the Commonwealth and respond to crises in a timely manner. While the Governor can always call a special session, we have seen how the opposition will respond if they do not agree with the special session\u2019s purpose. Virginians should not have to wait weeks or months to see coronavirus relief, racial justice legislation or infrastructure support.\\xa0', 'The bottom line is that the General Assembly must transition to a full-time legislature.

From inequitable healthcare access amid the pandemic, to the threat of rising seas on our coastal regions and the centuries of racial injustice for Virginians of color, the issues we face demand continuous debate and responsive policy.

Set a routine and stick to it', 'As you settle into the new semester and develop a new routine, be sure to introduce a solid bedtime routine as well. Going to sleep and waking up around the same time every day can be extremely beneficial because your body gets used to set rhythms. I know this can be difficult with homework assignments and other distractions, but try to make use of various resources that remind you when to hit the hay such as settings on your phone or apps to alert you of an approaching bedtime.\\xa0', '2. Limit screen time and blue light exposure before bed\\xa0', \"We have all heard this a million times, but do we follow this rule? Probably not. However, with online school and the ever-tempting world of social media, we need to establish solid boundaries between ourselves and our screens before bedtime. If you can\u2019t avoid screens and blue light altogether, consider purchasing blue light glasses \u2014 which are fairly inexpensive on Amazon \u2014 or adjust your device's settings to dim your screen. Also, the CDC states that exposing yourself to white light during the day can help you to fall asleep and stay asleep throughout the night. So, if possible, open your blinds and turn on the lights throughout the day to prepare for a sound sleep at night.\\xa0\", '3. Use a noise machine or play relaxing sounds', 'Personally, the best thing that ever happened to my sleep quality was getting a white noise machine. It perfectly blocks out noise from other rooms, and it drowns out the noise inside my head as well. If you can\u2019t afford to invest in a noise machine, you can always opt for a regular fan to produce the white noise. Also, there are several online services and apps that provide relaxing sounds \u2014 ranging from Headspace to Calm to ASMR videos on YouTube.\\xa0', '4. Try mediation to quiet your mind', 'Similar to using sounds to distract yourself, meditation is also an option to quiet your mind and settle into a sleepy state for a good night\u2019s rest. Headspace and Calm both provide mediation guides to talk you through the meditative process, which is especially helpful if you are new to the practice. Meditation allows you to get in touch with your body and notice how you are feeling and where your body is tense. Releasing this tension and getting grounded settles you in a way that would otherwise be difficult to reach with distractions all around you. Also, the benefits of meditation can be reinforced by incorporating it into a regular nighttime routine.\\xa0', '5. Journal before bed', 'If you\u2019re anything like me, the thing that prevents you from falling asleep and staying asleep is the never-ending train of thought barrelling through your mind. One way to counter this overwhelming bedtime occurrence is to journal before bed \u2014 simply write out your thoughts, anxieties and plans for the next day to ensure that your mind is settled. Also, keep a journal next to your bed so that if you wake with a sudden thought or something you need to remember for the following day, you can write it down and return to your peaceful slumber.\\xa0', '6. Be active throughout the day', 'Getting regular activity is crucial to a good night\u2019s sleep. Keep in mind that being active doesn\u2019t necessarily mean you have to hit the gym. Instead, being active can mean getting up and walking around your apartment or house or taking a trip to the mailbox. Odds are with online school you are exercising your mind plenty, but your body needs to use energy just as much. Some fun ways to be active include taking a walk around Grounds, playing \u201cJust Dance\u201d with your roommates or jumping rope. I know it seems like I\u2019m telling you to channel your inner kid \u2014 but if that\u2019s what it takes to get a good night\u2019s sleep, then so be it.\\xa0', '7. Do a peaceful activity to calm yourself down\\xa0', 'Another tactic that might help you to fall asleep and stay asleep is doing a peaceful \u2014 and perhaps mindless \u2014 activity like reading a book, doing puzzles or playing word games. In addition to settling yourself for bed, these activities can help to exercise your mind and help with skills like focus, critical thinking, problem-solving and memory. I recently purchased \"The Ultimate Brain Health Puzzle Book for Adults,\" and I find that it is very helpful in preparing me for bed.\\xa0', '8. Limit caffeine intake', \"As a caffeine lover, this is always hard to hear. However, limiting caffeine intake doesn't always mean you need less caffeine. Instead, limiting how late you consume caffeine may be the key to contributing to a better night\u2019s rest. Caffeine affects everyone differently, so pay attention to your body\u2019s response to caffeine and set a time limit that works for you. As a general rule, the effects of caffeine last for about five hours, so keep that in mind when creating your caffeine intake schedule. If you find that you are craving a caffeinated beverage after your time limit, try a bedtime tea as a substitute. These teas will curb your hot drink craving with the added benefit of helping you prepare for bed!\\xa0\", '9. Treat yourself to a new pillow, set of sheets or blanket', 'External factors contribute to the quality of sleep just as much as the internal factors of your body and mind. If you feel that your quality of sleep is being compromised by external discomfort, splurging on a new pillow or blanket may be the thing to set you at ease and help you drift into a peaceful slumber. With this solution, research is crucial to determine what is affecting your sleep and what options are available to solve the issue \u2014 so try to pay attention to what is uncomfortable and hurting your chances of good sleep.\\xa0', '10. Recognize when home remedies aren\u2019t sufficient', 'If you\u2019ve tried all these techniques and things still aren\u2019t working out for you, consider seeing a specialist that can help determine where the problem is occurring. This is especially important if the lack of quality sleep is beginning to affect your day-to-day life. Reach out to the Student Health Center or contact your primary care doctor to talk through the issue you are having and find a solution that suits you. Everyone needs and deserves quality sleep, so taking this step to ensure you are treating your body well is an essential act of self-care.']","426":"['When I first started learning guitar, my teacher was the internet.

It wasn\u2019t until my first lesson at the University that I learned my whole conceptualization of how to play the guitar was wrong.\\xa0', 'Basically, I had been learning guitar in a vacuum. Even if the notes lacked a cohesive rhythm, I couldn\u2019t tell and would just play them where I thought they sounded like they belonged. Perception isn\u2019t reality though, and these notes really belonged to a set rhythm \u2014 a rhythm with a preset tempo and metronomic flow, but I just didn\u2019t know how to discern this at first. Because I wasn\u2019t aware of this fundamental aspect of musical composition, I had to re-learn how to play every note in time with a beat. Within a few moments, I had gone from feeling like a somewhat capable guitar player with almost three years of experience all the way back to square one of music lessons.\\xa0', \"I recovered from that shock pretty quickly, but the process that came next was the real challenge. Playing with a metronome was alien, and I struggled with the simplest of exercises. I hated it. At one point during the semester, my instructor was understandably upset with the little to no progress I had made between sessions. He looked at me and said, \u201cThis is what I think \u2014 I think you try the exercises but you quit because it's hard.\u201d I was really taken aback by this statement because, well, I don\u2019t like to think of myself as a quitter.\\xa0\", \"However, I spent a lot of time thinking about my instructor's words and realized he was right. As much as I\u2019d like to think I was at least mediocre at guitar, the addition of rhythm essentially made playing the instrument seem like a completely foreign language to me. Yes, it should\u2019ve been hard to face this obstacle, but I hadn\u2019t let myself stop to acknowledge this new reality. On the other hand, I wasn\u2019t committing myself to my instructor\u2019s teachings, either. In short, I was quitting.\\xa0\", 'A few more lessons and a pandemic later, I\u2019m not great, but I\u2019m definitely better.

Even more importantly, however, is that I never forgot that revelation from my teacher in the cramped practice room on the bottom floor of Old Cabell Hall.\\xa0', 'For me, that moment was a wake-up call to a much broader truth \u2014 life often gets hard because we\u2019re constantly running into new challenges and different experiences. So what do we do? We adapt, change and learn. But that\u2019s nothing new. What I took away from that experience is how important it is to recognize when we\u2019re facing adversity.', 'At first, when I was learning to incorporate rhythm into my playing, I never stopped to recognize the difficulty of this fundamental task. Since then, I\u2019ve realized that as we are faced with obstacles, like our latest COVID-19 restrictions or our upcoming round of midterms, it is worth taking the time to reflect and project exactly what we\u2019re about to go through. If you have to stay up all night studying, think about what it\u2019ll physically feel like.\\xa0', 'For example, how will you feel at 2 a.m.? How is it going to feel halfway through? Think about your mental state. If you\u2019re getting ready to go through a tough week, what\u2019s your brain going to be saying by Wednesday? When exactly are you going to be stressed the most?', 'The point of this exercise is to familiarize yourself with the intimidating experience you\u2019re about to undertake. That way, when you reach these points of exhaustion or stress they won\u2019t come as a surprise, and you can take comfort in the fact that you\u2019ve prepared for those moments. Obviously, there are some situations in which we\u2019re in total epistemological darkness \u2014 I mean I can personally tell you from experience that it\u2019s impossible to know what it\u2019s like to hit a golf ball without ever playing golf. That being said, I believe in this exercise because it helps me reaffirm my commitment to my goals.\\xa0', 'So next time you start a new challenge, consider what it\u2019s going to require of you. Then, as you make progress, don\u2019t doubt yourself because it\u2019s hard. Instead, relish in the truth that it is supposed to be hard. I firmly believe whatever goals we might have are accomplishable, but attitude is what makes the difference.

For example, they eliminated the application fee and encouraged students to choose the credit\/general credit\/no credit grading option for prerequisites such as microeconomics, social psychology and other classes, in addition to offering information sessions, application workshops and office hours.', 'While Batten offered a number of resources in order to facilitate the application process during an unprecedented time, Mulligan also highlighted that Batten considered the \u201cfuller context of challenges students are facing as a result of the pandemic as part of the evaluation process.\u201d', 'Additionally, there was a slight increase in the number of women that were accepted this year \u2014 71 percent compared to 69 percent last year.

While isolation, boredom and decreased freedom result in unique responses for every individual, my quarantine experience was relatively pleasant. Daily online conversations with friends and family helped me stave off feelings of isolation.

Based on my experience, I am content with the University\u2019s resources for quarantined students.\\xa0', 'Before entering quarantine, I was provided with the contact information of multiple people to reach out to if I had any issues. Since I did not have any reason to reach out to these individuals, I cannot judge their effectiveness \u2014 however, I was thoroughly satisfied with the amount of resources that were made available to me.\\xa0', 'I was first contacted by the Virginia Department of Health who informed me that I had been contact traced, and they offered to answer any of my questions or concerns. They then provided information about the general quarantine process. I was next put into contact with a University Dean who confirmed the information and described the next steps the University would be taking with regards to my safety and wellbeing. Not long after, someone reached out with more information about where I would be spending my quarantine, transportation to and from the location and the expectations of my stay. The details of this conversation were confirmed in a followup email to our conversation.\\xa0', 'Shortly after I officially entered quarantine, I was emailed by a member of the University\u2019s Isolation and Quarantine Care Team who offered their personal support during the duration of my stay. The email included information about quarantine expectations, wellbeing and mental health support, meals and dining, trash disposal, linen and towel replacement, mail and information about ending the quarantine. Halfway through my quarantine, this person followed up with me to make sure I still did not have any questions and provided information about my departure process.\\xa0', 'The resources provided by the University were thorough and extensive. I had no questions that they couldn\u2019t readily answer. As far as I understand, the University guidelines were completely aligned with the Centers for Disease Control\u2019s quarantine expectations.\\xa0', 'While I cannot speak on behalf of others, I was also thoroughly pleased with the quarantine accommodations provided. The hotel room was clean, spacious and comfortable. There was sufficient storage for my clothes and the various items I brought with me. The hotel room had a large fridge and microwave, which made storing and reheating food an easy process.\\xa0', 'Additionally, I was pleased with the meal options. Before my arrival, my room was stocked with many bottles of water to ensure I stayed hydrated \u2014 and with every meal delivered, the University provided an additional two bottles of water. The meal schedule included delivery twice a day. In the afternoon, we were given lunch. Then during the evenings, we were given our dinner for that day and breakfast for the next day.\\xa0', 'As a vegan, I have a particular diet \u2014 nevertheless, the University provided ample options. I will admit that the first day was a rocky start for me, as I was provided with non-vegan options. While I could still eat my entrees, some of the side options \u2014 regular milk for instance \u2014 were clearly not vegan. However, that night, University Dining sent out a survey to receive feedback on the quality of our meals. I indicated that I had been provided with non-vegan food. Once I submitted that survey, I never again received any non-vegan food. The University was responsive and patient with my dietary restrictions.\\xa0', 'Despite all of the University accommodations, students have been recklessly ignoring the restrictions of their quarantine. A recent tweet reveals that quarantined students have been gathering together in hotel halls and within the hotel gym. This behavior is unacceptable. Quarantine exists as a measure to protect the University and surrounding community from students who may have contracted the COVID-19 virus. Simply put, students in quarantine do not know whether they will test positive or not. Those who choose to gather while in quarantine risk endangering themselves, hotel staff and the entire University community. These actions blatantly break quarantine rules and are entirely inexcusable.\\xa0', 'Many of my friends have shared concerns about entering quarantine. While I cannot speak to everyone\u2019s experience, mine was fairly pleasant. The University effectively answered all my questions, provided me with copious resources and contacts and was accommodating to my personal dining restrictions.

While overwhelming at times, these extracurricular applications foster unique communities and positions, and there is always something for everyone. But one place where applications don\u2019t belong is in the College, where many majors have a limited capacity, and thus, a strict application process. Many colleges and universities have potential students apply to their major along with the application to the school itself, allowing students to start pursuing their majors and other potential programs in their first year or two. At U.Va., however, many students stress about applying to some of the many programs within the College of Arts and Sciences alone. These application-based majors incite stress and restrict opportunities for students paying tens of thousands of dollars to pursue an education in their interest. \\xa0', 'The first year of college should be about exploration and adjusting to a new life, yet scores of students have to worry about planning for future applications, backup plans and which prerequisite courses to commit to. Unless they\u2019re an Echols Scholar, students in the College must complete competency and area requirements, while also managing prerequisites for various potential majors. It\u2019s common for students to undertake prerequisite courses for multiple application-based majors, in addition to managing general education courses and classes for backup majors. For example, the McIntire School of Commerce has five Economics and Commerce courses as prerequisites that students have to take before they can enroll in the program. This leaves little room for academic exploration, since students are often undertaking more than what is manageable. Undergraduates are already pressured to decide on the career they will pursue for the rest of their life, and program applications only increase the pressure and sense of uncertainty.\\xa0', 'The University\u2019s extreme amount of applications for clubs, majors or research can create a toxic culture of competitiveness among students. The advantages of being in a smaller, application-based major include more individualized attention, exclusive seminars and prestige. Many students want the benefits of the 26 person Political Philosophy, Policy and Law major \u2014 which requires an application \u2014 rather than a spot amongst the 700 Government and Foreign Affairs majors within the Department of Politics. With the quality of their education at stake, students experience overwhelming stress brought on by exclusive major applications. Students also fear their career aspirations might be limited by what majors they are accepted into. For example if you weren\u2019t accepted into the McIntire School of Commerce or the Media Studies major, there isn\u2019t another closely related option for those pursuing marketing. While the University typically has a healthy amount of competitiveness that pushes students to do their best, majors that are limited by the amount of students they can admit create a toxic culture.\\xa0', \"Colin Bird, Director of the Political Philosophy, Policy and Law program has explained that majors have to limit students through admission processes so they receive enough attention in seminars and thesis writing. Instead of limiting students through an application system, the University should prioritize hiring within the budget so additional faculty can accommodate more students in desirable majors. This would allow for greater student capacity and individualized attention. Most incoming first years are under the impression that they can major in whatever they want, with exceptions like the Frank Batten School of Leadership and Public Policy or McIntire. It comes as a rude awakening to many that you might have to compete for majors that are declarable at other schools. Directing more resources toward majors that are in high demand means more students are able to pursue the education they came to the University for. It is unfair for students to drastically alter their plans because they weren't able to take one of the spots in a specific program. For example, the Global Studies program could only accept around 220 out of 472 interested applicants last year, meaning over 250 students paying tens of thousands in tuition had to default to a backup major that may not even align with their academic and career goals.\", 'Schools and majors bring on more stress than just the application in their second year \u2014 students are desperate to get into prestigious extracurriculars and undertake hard classes to prove themselves and to have something to put on their applications. While this culture of competitiveness is beneficial in driving some students to go above and beyond, it can create unnecessary stress for many others that can deter their academic performance. Some students have additional responsibilities \u2014 such as working a job \u2014 that limit how much time they can spend on developing a competitive application for majors that should be open to all. The University should be about academic exploration and opportunities, not applications and limitations at every turn.\\xa0', 'Nicole Chebili is an Opinion Columnist for The Cavalier Daily.

However, if the internship opportunities we\u2019re presented with are accurate, we\u2019re worth nothing. Unpaid internships, which account for 43 percent of internships at for-profit companies and most public sector internships, are now a major part of entering the workforce \u2014 they shouldn\u2019t be. These unpaid positions are a detriment to interns, low-income students and the overall economy. To fix that, we need to ban unpaid internships entirely.\\xa0', 'The common defense of unpaid internships is that they offer you experience and provide you the opportunity to get your foot in the door. However, these defenses are simply not true. If you take an unpaid internship, statistically you will be treated much worse in the job market than someone with a paid internship. Paid interns are nearly twice as likely to receive a job offer after an internship. The same study found that people who took unpaid internships and received a job offer were offered less salary than people who took no internship at all. Despite doing work that is essential to the functionality of companies, unpaid interns are offered $19,000 less than the median paid-intern at various companies. In general, students who take unpaid internships will see fewer opportunities and earn less money than those who take paid roles. Despite unpaid interns performing worse in the job market than paid interns, the fact remains that having any internship experience leads to higher employability after college. That\u2019s a problem for students who can\u2019t afford unpaid internships.', 'On average, an unpaid internship costs the intern $6,800. Those costs can increase dramatically depending on the city or location of the internship. For many students with wealthier families, their parents will take on the expenses of unpaid internships. Other students \u2014 who don\u2019t come from an elevated socio-economic background \u2014 don\u2019t have the same financial support. Additionally, some schools even charge students per credit for internships that offer credit. Often, these charges amount to more than $1,000 per credit. In other words, students are essentially paying their school to have the opportunity to work for an employer for free. These costs are incredibly prohibitive to most students seeking internships \u2014 many unpaid interns rely on living rent-free or are dependent on money from their parents to afford basic living expenses.\\xa0', 'What do students do if they don\u2019t have family money to fall back on? The costs of taking an unpaid role are amplified with low-income students who also incur the opportunity cost of not taking other roles. Plenty of unpaid interns, like PayOurInterns founder Carlos Vera, have to work multiple jobs just to afford the basic costs of living in Washington D.C. Still, many low-income students and students of color are locked out of opportunities simply because they can\u2019t afford to take on unpaid roles. Take Congress, for example, where an overwhelming majority of interns are white and wealthy. There\u2019s the infamous Paul Ryan selfie with the entire Congressional Republican intern class and not a single person of color in sight. It\u2019s easy to attribute it to the politics of the GOP,\\xa0but the Congressional intern classes are overwhelmingly white because they remain unpaid, not because of party politics. When employers offer internships based on prestige and nothing else, they leave out an enormous pool of talent that is otherwise underrepresented in these fields. Though they may not explicitly say it, the basic assumption of companies offering unpaid internships is that any applicant must be wealthy enough to afford to live in a major city with no real income for three months.\\xa0', 'Unpaid internships also have a very real effect on the job market. During recessions, job seekers and current students are hungrier for jobs that keep disappearing. Those seeking professional experience in school are providing major companies with an endless flow of free labor that is eliminating the need for entry-level professionals. Over time, we have legitimized free labor as a way to gain entry into industries, instead of working in real entry-level positions. Even in 2010, recent graduates were being forced into internship roles because entry-level positions simply didn\u2019t exist anymore. When unemployment is high \u2014 and it likely will be for the coming months and years \u2014 employers displace full-time workers by hiring a continuous stream of unpaid interns.\\xa0', 'There are plenty of steps we can take to remedy the effects of unpaid internships. For starters, colleges can stop pushing students towards internships that don\u2019t offer compensation or payment. If schools agree that we are worth more than $0 per hour, they shouldn\u2019t be promoting unpaid internships in the first place. Yet U.Va. still allows unpaid roles to be advertised on Handshake and career fairs and lets companies who exploit unpaid interns recruit heavily from our student body. \\xa0More importantly, however, we can get serious about helping interns by banning unpaid internships entirely. They serve as another obstacle for low-income students, and they have no real purpose other than funneling students towards companies that take advantage of their skills.\\xa0', 'Jeremy Siegel is an Opinion Columnist for The Cavalier Daily.

Since its inception, the University has become a prestigious university with a healthy endowment and many prominent graduates. Many students though, while proud to attend the University, are deeply troubled by Thomas Jefferson\u2019s and the University\u2019s role in perpetuating policies of racial oppression. The University has acknowledged the need to address that harm and has started making investments in programs to acknowledge its role in perpetuating the oppression of enslaved laborers.', 'However, a seldom explored aspect of Jefferson\u2019s legacy was his impact on American Indians. Jefferson had a prominent role in displacing Natives, whom he acknowledged in \u201cNotes on the State of Virginia\u201d as being present around Monticello. The land where the University sits today was once the home of Monacan people, who cared for the land. Jefferson contributed to their removal and the removal of other nations all across the country. As President, Jefferson promoted the \u201ccivilization\u201d of Native Americans, also known as forced assimilation.\\xa0', 'In the 200 years since the University\u2019s establishment, little has been done to atone for the sins of this school\u2019s founder. If anything, the University has only further perpetuated the same attitudes until very recently. A century ago, the field of eugenics was booming and the University was at the forefront of this pseudoscience. The Commonwealth of Virginia as a whole is infamous for the role of Walter Plecker in the erasure of Native Americans and the segregation of African Americans. These same ideas that undergirded the policies that became the \u201cRacial Integrity Act\u201d were once taught at the University as scientific fact, affirming white supremacy.\\xa0', \"Statues celebrating Confederate soldiers were erected to intimidate African Americans, who had just fifty years prior been freed from the shackles of slavery.

The one of George Rogers Clark sits on University Grounds and depicts this valiant white man, leading his soldiers in the merciless slaughter of unarmed Indians, with the inscription, \u201cConqueror of the Northwest.\u201d Both of these statues have been slated for removal after years of protest and advocacy by Native Americans.\", 'With such negative portrayals, I can tell you that as a Native American it is sometimes painful to be a student at the University. It is hard to find any representation that presents my family\u2019s history in a way that is authentic and affirming to my identity.

But the history of my nation or that of the many other nations across what is now the Commonwealth of Virginia and the United States is hardly found in the curriculum. Programs celebrating modern Native Americans and exploring modern Native culture, art and political movements are anemic. Native Americans are underrepresented in the faculty and student body, classes on topics relating to Native Americans are scarce and a minor in Indigenous studies is only now being considered. William and Mary and Virginia Tech both offer a Native Studies minor and have a tribal liaison. The University, on the other hand, has no dedicated staff to support Native American students or advise students seeking to study Native issues. Students wishing to concentrate in Native American studies must be creative and build their own plan, often utilizing related coursework in place of classes focused on the actual topic of interest. The University and this administration offer bargain bin novelties and lip service rather than considering any legitimate proposals, and then take credit for the work of Indigenous people and allies.', 'The University must begin taking steps to actively confront its history and that of its founder. We must begin acknowledging that painful past and work towards rectifying it so future Native students feel welcome here. The University must examine their admissions practices to find out why Native students are under-accepted and under-enrolled. We must begin immediate work towards a Native American and Indigenous Studies Center, with dedicated space for faculty to work and for Native students to socialize. There needs to be a dedicated position within the University to consult with the Virginia tribes to improve relations and seek vital input on programs that may impact them or their citizens, especially those attending the University.

Holding a rally outside the Board of Visitors is absolutely an example of self-governance.\u201d\\xa0', 'When it comes to self-governance, the University often highlights three main organizations, though student leaders believe the concept extends well beyond that.', '\u201cThe University points to the University Judiciary Committee, Honor Committee and Student Council [when it comes to self-governance],\u201d said Abel Liu, chair of Student Council\u2019s representative body and third-year College student. \u201cHonestly, though, the area where I personally see students picking up the University\u2019s slack the most has to be in engaging, retaining and welcoming marginalized students. Immediately, I think of undocUVA, Muslim Institute for Leadership and Empowerment, Latinx Leadership Institute and the Black Presidents Council.\u201d\\xa0', 'As already mentioned, often the three examples of student self-governance on Grounds are Honor Committee, UJC and Student Council. The Honor Committee tries students who break the Honor Code \u2014 unlike most universities which hire administrators to handle student violations \u2014 \\xa0while UJC investigates alleged violations of the University\u2019s Standards of Conduct such as physical assault or any other violation of a local, state or federal law. Student Council is meant to protect and improve the opportunities and quality of life for every student through assisting with student activities on Grounds, passing legislation and approving the financial distribution of student activities fees, among other duties.\\xa0', '\u201cThe true power of student government is in its ability to formally represent student interests,\u201d Liu said. \u201cThink of StudCo as a medium for student collective bargaining powers. StudCo may be an institution, but do not mistake the body\u2019s formal powers as its only potential \u2026 I wish that StudCo would be called the University of Virginia Student Union.\u201d\\xa0', 'Student self-governance is often discussed as a Jeffersonian idea, and its history is extensive. As described on Student Council\u2019s website, in 1954, 11 male students were suspended \u2014 and four recommended for expulsion \u2014 after assisting in the rape of a 19-year-old woman in an East Lawn room. Protests broke out among students, who said the punishment for the rape was too harsh and called for more power to be given to the student body. Even though Stud Council\u2019s judicial powers were initially revoked, seven months later, UJC was created, giving more power to the students. Those claiming that punishment for the rape were too harsh had obtained what they desired.', 'In 2019, Jia Tolentino, Class of 2009 alumna and writer for The New Yorker, published \u201cTrick Mirror: Reflections on Self Delusion,\u201d a collection of essays. In an essay entitled \u201cWe Come from Old Virginia,\u201d Tolentino writes that the students \u201cformed a Judiciary Committee that would \u2018return the disciplinary power of the president\u2019s office to the student body.\u2019\u201d\\xa0', 'Tolentino goes on to write that self-governance, including UJC, is one of the University\u2019s \u201cproudest practices.\u201d But she also argues that by not admitting to UJC\u2019s problematic origins, and instead only speaking of the uniqueness of an organization like UJC, the University continues to harbor a fake image of itself.\\xa0', '\u201cThe school\u2019s self-conception will never be completely true until it can admit the extent to which it has always been fake,\u201d she wrote.\\xa0', '\u201c[Community trust] has been a student sourced and student maintained idea,\u201d Strike said. \u201cIf an administrator told us to not steal things, people wouldn\u2019t really listen. We all elect officials to Honor, we all sign the Honor scrolls at convocation, we are all committing to this idea of Community Trust \u2026 Community trust has been built for 200 years. It is ingrained in the student conscious.\u201d\\xa0', 'In its simplest form, the University\u2019s community of trust allows students to leave their laptop in the library and not worry about it being stolen while they are going to the bathroom or to get coffee.\\xa0', 'However, this idea of Community Trust, Strike said, is surrounded by a lot of \u201cdisillusionment and general disinterest in the concept of self-governance.\u201d\\xa0', '\u201cI think there are a lot of really valid reasons for that, like students of color often talk about how Honor and UJC have very poor histories with the percentage of students of color that are expelled versus white students,\u201d Strike said.\\xa0', 'In 2019 Honor released its Bicentennial Report \u2014 the largest internal review of case outcomes ever conducted by the Committee, featuring data from a century of annual dismissals and three decades of data on sanctions. The report showed there has historically been a disproportionately high sanction rate for students of color, especially African and Asian American individuals.', 'For example, Asian American students comprised half of all sanctions between 2012 and 2017, but only comprised 12 percent of the student population. In addition, between 1987 and 1989, Black students comprised 42 percent of sanctioned students while the Black student population was only around 9 percent.', 'In its demands\\xa0\u2014 published in summer 2020 \u2014 to the University, Black student activists called \u201cupon the Honor and University Judiciary Committees to commit more of their time and resources investigating racial biases present in case litigation and increasing the presence of Black, Indigenous and people of color in each institution.\u201d\\xa0', 'Edwards said that up until summer 2020, discussions regarding race were often sparse.\\xa0', '\u201cSmall discussions were more frequent, often bringing up the fact that Honor has struggled with diversity, but then quickly dissipating after there\u2019s a mention of how we haven\u2019t figured out how to handle our lack of diversity,\u201d Edwards said.', 'Edwards also said in summer 2020 \u2014 after Honor received backlash from the University community after it remained silent following the murders of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor \u2014\\xa0the committee put forth a set of four actions which will revamp Honor processes and recruitment to better reach students of color.\\xa0', '\u201cIt\u2019s definitely the biggest change we\u2019ve initiated in regard to diversity and inclusion in my time with Honor,\u201d Edwards said.\\xa0', 'Edward explained that one of the measures was requiring everyone in Honor to read \u201cSo You Want to Talk About Race\u201d by Ijeoma Oluo. In addition, Honor began showing live demographics of case data and connecting more closely with other CIOs and continued communication with endorsed organizations. The statement also says Honor will continue to put out more comprehensive measures moving forward. However, as of January 2021, no other measures have been released.\\xa0', '\u201cWe are beginning to look into our options for dealing with potential biases connected to reports once the case is in our system, but we don\u2019t have any concrete plans to announce just yet,\u201d Edwards said.\\xa0', 'Meanwhile, in the past semester, \u201cevery UJC member was required to be present for mandatory bias training,\u201d said Gabby Cox, Chair of UJC\u2019s Executive Committee and fourth-year Batten student, in an email to The Cavalier Daily.\\xa0', 'The bias training was composed of two parts, one presented on \u201cPreventing and Addressing Discrimination, Harassment, and Retaliation,\u201d which was given by the Office of Equal Opportunity and Civil Rights, and the second entitled \u201cA Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion\u201d presentation given by Associate Dean of Students Tabitha Enoch.', 'Cox also explained how UJC senior support officers also had a differing approach to addressing diversity and inclusion, such as discussing ways UJC can \u201cimprove [their] image of inclusivity,\u201d and \u201cwhat communities [they] have done a less than adequate job recruiting from.\u201d\\xa0', 'Meanwhile, Student Council is seeking similar action.', '\u201cI think one solution is really straightforward \u2014 U.Va. students as a whole need to elect BIPOC students to positions of leadership,\u201d Liu said. \u201cAll leaders of U.Va.\u2019s self-governing bodies need to center BIPOC voices and prioritize appointing BIPOCs \u2026 I have prioritized engaging and retaining representatives of color as a person of color myself.\u201d\\xa0', 'Liu also said the 2020-2021 Representative Body is Student Council\u2019s first \u201cmajority minority\u201d body, meaning that more than 50 percent of the body is composed of representatives from historically underrepresented groups.\\xa0', '\u201cA majority minority rep body was possible because we retained several of our BIPOC representatives from 2019-2020, and many of the body\u2019s 2020-2021 vacancies were filled with BIPOC students,\u201d Liu said. \u201cIt is my single proudest accomplishment from my time as chair of the representative body, and [it is a strong indication that more] change is coming.\u201d', 'Strike spoke about times where the University often leads students in circles, pretending to cooperate with self-governance bodies in order to save face.\\xa0', '\u201cA fantastic example of that is the Tuition and Fees Committee, where the Student Council president is responsible for appointing three of four students to the tuition and fees committee,\u201d Strike said. Although the Studco committee reviews the proposal, \u201cby the time the committee is reviewing the proposal, it\u2019s already been submitted to the Board of Visitors, so they are basically letting the committee give input after the fact.\u201d\\xa0', 'Liu agrees that self-governance at the University is often understood as an all-powerful entity, yet the students have less power than originally led to believe', '\u201cNo Student Council branch is able to exercise direct and totally unsupervised authority over any area of student life,\u201d Liu said. \u201cWe have no magic wand. This is not to say that the powers and tools that we do have have no bite \u2014 they do. However, one small part of the problem with Student Council is the government frame we use to describe it. Our language in [regards to] the status quo just creates confusion and disappointment.\u201d\\xa0', 'When asked about increasing the power or autonomy of self-governing bodies, Liu pointed out the University should better fund Student Council.\\xa0', '\u201cThe University could further empower StudCo\u2019s policy making abilities by funding the organization beyond student activity fees money,\u201d Liu said. \u201cSuch increases could be used to expand our resource units like the Community Food Pantry, Student Legal Services, U.Va. Mutual Aid, etc. These services address real gaps in basic student welfare at U.Va. and are the types of services that the University should fund itself.\u201d\\xa0', 'In addition, the University could also include students in more of its decisions.\\xa0', '\u201cThe University could increase our body\u2019s autonomy by integrating students into its decision making processes earlier. And then actually listening to them. \\xa0In my experience, students \\xa0\u2014 besides the Student Member of the Board of Visitors \u2014\\xa0are generally asked to give feedback on decisions that have already been made,\u201d Liu said.', 'However, as Liu pointed out, a lack of complete autonomy can be changed.\\xa0', '\u201cA student institution\u2019s autonomy isn\u2019t just controlled by the U.Va. Administration. That would be some weird oxymoronic passive autonomy... Any institution can increase its own autonomy. In the context of StudCo, to obtain greater autonomy, we really need to focus on gaining more leverage. Increasing StudCo\u2019s leverage could be done through FOIAs, strikes, coalitions, community engagement, bad press, etc,\u201d Liu said.\\xa0', '\u201cStudent Council can also increase its own autonomy and impact by building systems of dual power with groups that have the capacity to organize and engage in widespread direct action,\u201d Liu also explained. \u201cFor example, we partnered with the First-Generation Low-Income Partnership at U.Va. and YDSA to advocate for a CR\/GC\/NC grading option for the 2020-2021 Academic Year.\u201d\\xa0', 'The partnership proved successful.', '\u201cWe were far more effective working together than any one group would have been in isolation. Student Council has a unique ability to facilitate negotiations with administrators, collect data, and offer \u2018institutional support\u2019 for policy efforts,\u201d Liu said.', 'The CR\/GC\/NC grading option was added to both the fall 2020 and spring 2021 semesters.', '\u201cThose tools, combined with direction action and organizing efforts, represent a substantial challenge to the dominant administrative power structures at the University,\u201d he added.', 'Strike discussed how there are a lot of misconceptions surrounding exactly how and what self-governance means at the University.\\xa0', '\u201cWhile the growth does show that student self-governance has been historically successful, along with that growth, it has become more inaccessible,\u201d Strike said. \u201cHonor, UJC and StudCo have become so big and complicated that the average student doesn\u2019t have time to digest what the differences are and what each of them does. It is just so nebulous that it is not accessible anymore.\u201d\\xa0', 'As for Student Council, \u201c[it] needs to better articulate and publicize the meaningful work that we do\u201d Liu said.', '\u201cIf all I knew about StudCo came from CavDaily, I wouldn\u2019t want to join either,\u201d he added. \u201cI\u2019ll own a lot of the criticisms of self-governing bodies, but the charge that we do nothing is fictitious. Our organization needs to crack the code on how to effectively communicate to over 20,000 students, and that\u2019s really hard. My biggest frustration is that people think that Student Council \u2018doesn\u2019t do anything.\u2019\u201d', 'This sense of disillusionment and lack of understanding in the self-governing system can contribute to low turnout and disinterest in self-governance. For example, students voting for Student Council president have steadily decreased since 2017, and in 2019 only 10 percent of the student body participated. In addition, Honor requires only 10 percent of students to vote on amendments for them to be adopted.', 'Edwards emphasized the lack of student turnout.\\xa0', '\u201cOne thing that would increase our productivity would be better knowledge of what the student body wants to see from us \u2014 talking to us at education events, voting in student elections in February and giving community input at committee meetings,\u201d Edwards said. \u201cWe can\u2019t do what the student body wants if the student body doesn\u2019t tell us what they want.\u201d\\xa0', 'For the self-governing systems to work as they were meant to, members of the self-governing groups ask fellow students to take action.', '\u201cIt is incredibly important that every student actively engages in self-governance in some way, so whether that is lobbying the administration or voting in student elections,\u201d Strike explained.', '\u201cA majority of colleges do provide some form of compensation to the student government,\u201d Strike said.\\xa0', 'Around 77 percent of student leaders at other colleges around the country are compensated for their work, making the University an outlier. For example, at Georgia Tech, the Speaker of the House makes $2,450 a year and the president makes $8,000 a year. At the University of New Orleans, all student government officers are compensated. For many low-income students, this free labor at U.Va. can pose a barrier.', '\u201cI work 20 to 30 hours a week for Student Council for free,\u201d Liu said. \u201cI am able to do so because of my own privilege \u2026 Student self-governance equating to free labor just adds another barrier for [First Generation Low Income] students to participate\u201d', 'Edwards says she never truly thought about receiving compensation before.', '\u201cI\u2019ve seen my position as a form of public service \u2014 I want to contribute as directly as possible to the morals and ideals that create the Community of Trust and make the system more fair and just,\u201d she said.\\xa0', 'Similarly, Cox echoed a similar sentiment when asked about compensation.\\xa0', '\u201cI did not run for this position with the hope of being compensated or even recognized,\u201d Cox said. \u201cMy intent was to serve as a fair and effective leader of an organization that is given the responsibility to adjudicate violations of the standards of conduct.\u201d\\xa0', 'However, Cox also pointed out her position became a full-time job with the additional COVID-19 compliance cases. In the fall 2020 semester, of the 23 cases handled by UJC, 9 cases involved COVID-19 policies.\\xa0', '\u201cThe toll of being a full time student while simultaneously spending at least 20 hours a week on one organization, working another job, as well as other organizational commitments has taken a toll on my mental, emotional and physical health. This year has been arguably exponentially more taxing for student leaders than the past,\u201d Cox explained. \u201cSpeaking for myself and myself alone, compensation is not what I request but more communication with those in high positions at the University.\u201d\\xa0', 'Cox explained that while she doesn\u2019t feel that she is entitled to certain privileges, she does wish the University could make more of an effort to understand the challenges leaders of self-governing organizations face.', 'Often, at other universities that do not provide direct compensation, student government is given additional, paid staff to help and manage the work. For example, at James Madison University, additional staff assists in managing and assisting students in starting up and joining clubs.\\xa0', 'However, at the University, Student Council is in charge of those tasks.\\xa0', 'For students who need to work in order to support themselves through college, Honor can seem unreachable due to the time commitment.\\xa0', '\u201cI think receiving compensation for serving on Committee or as a Support Officer could go either way \u2014 it could attract people who are greedy or power hungry, but it could also attract demographics of students we might not have reached, such as low-income or first-generation students, who can\u2019t afford to join Honor due to the time commitment,\u201d Edwards said.', 'Liu expressed that the University could do more about compensation.', '\u201cIf the University truly wanted to preserve student autonomy over student processes and organizations and compensate us for the massive amounts of work we do, they could,\u201d he said.', 'Looking at the over 3,000 cases the University has accumulated, one must ask themselves where blame should be placed, if anywhere at all.\\xa0', '\u201cI do think it would be more effective if the University itself held students accountable and just cut UJC out of COVID-19-related sanctions,\u201d Liu said. \u201cThe scale of non-compliance last semester was far too large for any student organization to process, especially a group of students who were not being paid.\u201d', 'Cox said that handling COVID-19-related compliance issues \\xa0is \u201cdifficult\u201d due to the higher number of cases the body is required to adjudicate, though she was quick to add that UJC has an \u201cextremely strong exec team and general body that foresaw this challenge and has responded by putting in an immense amount of time and effort into making sure that cases are heard in a timely manner without sacrificing student\u2019s rights.\u201d\\xa0', 'Cox said she can only ask the University to communicate effectively with the student body about their expectations of behavior. On Feb. 24, UJC released a statement in regards to the spike of COVID-19 cases seen at the University the week of Feb. 15 when over 700 cases were reported. The statement acknowledges \u201cthat inadequate oversight by University administration \u2026 [has] directly negatively impacted our community,\u201d as UJC has been forced to adapt to heightened caseloads as it bears the responsibility for adjudicating COVID-19-related violations.', '\u201cI cannot speak for the University itself, but as a leader of a student governance organization, it is my opinion that the University has an obligation to be transparent and clear in its communication to students about what is classified as a COVID violation and possible punishments if you fail to comply with said local, state, federal and University policy,\u201d Cox said.\\xa0', 'But ultimately, she believes the responsibility lies on students to be aware of and follow these COVID-19 guidelines.', '\u201cThe responsibility of students is on an individual level,\u201d Cox said. \u201cI believe that the student themself has the obligation to adhere to policy in order to protect themselves, their peers and the broader Charlottesville community.\u201d', 'However, others think differently.', '\u201cStudent self-governance and the Community of Trust are being used as scapegoats for the inevitable spike in COVID-19 cases in Charlottesville due to U.Va.\u2019s reopening,\u201d Liu said. \u201cThe sole party accountable for that fact that U.Va. is reopening in the first place is the University itself.\u201d']","451":"['\u201cThe Black Student Alliance facilitates community for Black students at an institution that may otherwise feel unwelcome to them,\u201d said Norah Mulinda, a fourth-year College student and former BSA special events chair. \u201cIt can be difficult for students to transition into a space that wasn\u2019t built for them, surrounded by people who may not always be looking out for them. BSA provides resources, companionship, and advocacy for Black students at the University who may have otherwise felt siloed from the overwhelmingly white majority.\u201d\\xa0', 'The Black Student Alliance was formed in 1969 by a group of Black students who sought to create an organization they could call their own.

These events include Welcome Week, which is hosted in the fall for new students, Black Ball, which is hosted every February during Black History Month, and BLACKOUT, which is an outdoors event that celebrates all of the Black graduates at the University held at the end of the semester, as well as various other activities which encourage social connection.', 'Even though COVID-19 has restricted BSA\u2019s ability to host the large in-person social gatherings and events that it annually holds, the organization has prepared and taken the necessary steps to make many of its events accessible to students without breaking health guidelines and restrictions for the 2020-2021 academic year.\\xa0', '\u201c[We will] always have some sort of virtual or online component to all of our events and meetings,\u201d Warren said.\\xa0', 'BSA has not only done the work to transition their typically in-person events to an online format, but they have also made plans to support students as they return to campus from a summer drastically impacted by COVID-19.', \"\u201c[We want] to try to make sure that we're being more accessible to other topics that have come up recently \u2014 just trying to make sure that we're addressing the mental and emotional toll that [the summer of 2020 had] on Black students,\u201d Warren said. \u201c[We want to] make sure that we\u2019re supporting students, knowing the coronavirus is disproportionately affecting Black and brown communities.\u201d\\xa0\", 'Events hosted by the Black Student Alliance have provided different opportunities for those who participate. While these events are usually social and aid students in creating bonds and forming memories with their peers, these events have also served a purpose in igniting and creating opportunities for leadership among students who have an interest in deepening their involvement within the organization.', 'Through leadership opportunities such as roles on the executive board, joining committees and pioneering group events, students have also been able to pursue some of their own personal interests and create a platform for others to share their stories and experiences as well. This has also allowed students to reach out to Black residents within their community and connect with different people across the country.', 'Ciara Blackston \u2014 Class of 2020 alumna and BSA vice president for 2018-19 and 2019-20 academic years \u2014 reminisced on her time in BSA and how attending events eventually led to becoming more active around campus.', '\u201cWhat I loved about being vice president is that I had free rein to do specialty events that I really thought engaged the community,\u201d Blackston said. \u201c[During] my third year, I did a movie screening for \u2018Us,\u2019 a Jordan Peele film, and then during my fourth year, I was able to lead the charge in bringing Cyntoia Brown to Grounds.\u201d', 'It is not uncommon for the Black Student Alliance to bring in nationally recognized guest speakers. Back in February of 2013, BSA held an event for American activist and poet Nikki Giovanni, who spoke on the importance of student activism and held a book signing for those who attended.\\xa0', 'Past guest speakers have also included University faculty. In February of 2019, the Black Student Alliance hosted an event with Beverly Adams, assistant dean and associate psychology professor, who spoke on the stigmas and significance of mental health within the Black community \u2014 an event that was also co-sponsored by the Eta Sigma Chapter of Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity Inc., a historically African American intercollegiate Greek-letter fraternity.', 'BSA has also held events throughout the fall semester that have provided students with a space to talk about their frustrations, what\u2019s on their mind and how they are traversing through the semester. One of these events was an Election Processing Community Space, held in conjunction with the National Pan-Hellenic Council in November of 2020. The event created \u201can open and safe space for Black students to debrief and share their thoughts regarding the election.\u201d BSA also organized several presidential and vice presidential debate watch parties through their Political Action Committee throughout the 2020 presidential election season.', 'However, organizers say it is also important that students feel safe and open to actively engage in these events.', \"\u201cWe want to make sure that students know that we support them \u2026 [and that] their well-being is our priority,\u201d Warren said. \u201cWe're also talking about those harder-to-have conversations of really challenging our own internal ideals ...

In June of 2020, the Black Student Alliance pulled from its own resources to donate directly to Charlottesville organizations that were dedicated to uplifting the Black Charlottesville community. In a previous article by The Cavalier Daily, Warren discussed how she encouraged others to donate to their local community as well, whether it be in Charlottesville or somewhere closer to home.', 'Even though BSA has done past work supporting the Charlottesville community directly, members have no plans to stop their work at just making donations to organizations that empower the Black community.', '\u201cI would love to see BSA do more within the Charlottesville community [and] make sure that as a Black population within Charlottesville \u2014 both students and Charlottesville residents \u2014 that we can become more united, as I think that is a great way to build a coalition that can work,\u201d Blackston said.', 'The Black Student Alliance has also opened its doors to those who come from various backgrounds and, as an organization, has worked towards creating a space where both Black students and their allies can learn and grow.', '\u201cBSA provides a safe environment where you can speak freely without being afraid of judgement,\u201d said Holly Battist, third-year Education student and BSA executive board member, in an interview with the Cavalier Daily. \u201cWe host many events not just for Black students, but for anyone who is interested.\u201d', 'However, the COVID-19 pandemic has affected the coordination of these events for community-wide engagement at the University to some small extent.', '\u201cPrior to [COVID-19] happening, we had goals moving forward to try and keep Black students engaged \u2014 to encourage more unity among Black organizations and co-sponsorships with other Multicultural Student Organizations,\u201d Warren said.', 'One of the core values of the Black Student Alliance, alongside creating a place of comfort for students, is recognizing and remembering the history of Black workers, student alumni and BSA itself, all of which have largely contributed to the success of the University today.', \"\u201cHistory is so important, especially to me, and I think to the other members of BSA as well.

Virginia alumni\u2019s veteran scorers as well as young emerging talent are providing a strong argument that the Cavaliers are capable of producing skilled players at the NBA level. These are the eight players making that case this season.', 'Guard Malcolm Brogdon', 'The leader of the pack, Brogdon has been playing the best basketball of his still young career for the Pacers, averaging a career-high in points with 21.2 this year \u2014 an almost five-point increase from his previous high of 16.5 last season. The 2017 Rookie of the Year has been underrated all year, keeping the Pacers in striking distance of a playoff spot largely with his scoring and playmaking ability, emphasized by the departure of former Pacer guard Victor Oladipo to Houston earlier in the season. Brogdon has picked up the slack and is yet to score less than 10 points in a game this year. He notably put up a career-high of 36 points and nine assists in a dominant performance against Toronto in January, while his versatility and athleticism were on full display with this dunk over All-Star center Joel Embiid. Brogdon\u2019s pairing with emerging All-Star Domantas Sabonis makes the Pacers a team to watch as they make a playoff push in the second half of the season.\\xa0', 'Guard Joe Harris', 'The former Cavalier sharpshooter has carved a niche for himself in a stacked Nets lineup, starting among All-Stars in guard Kyrie Irving, guard James Harden and forward Kevin Durant. With that level of scoring talent surrounding him, it\u2019s somewhat surprising that Harris has found a way to up his own offensive game, posting a career-high of 14.8 points per game. Harris has excelled in shooting from beyond the arc since his days in Charlottesville, and this year he is shooting a ridiculous 50.6 percent from three, placing him among the best in the league with a minimum of 100 attempts. His eFG percentage \u2014 a stat that weights the higher value of three-point shots \u2014 is a league-best 69.7. His strongest performance so far this year came in a 30-point showing in which Harris knocked down eight three-pointers against Washington. With the Nets currently second in the Eastern Conference, the Chelan, Wash. native fits nicely into a team looking to compete for a championship.', 'Forward De\u2019Andre Hunter', 'After having his rookie campaign abruptly cut short due to COVID-19, Hunter started off his second season in the league impressively for the Hawks before once again being interrupted \u2014 this time due to an unfortunate right knee injury that has him out indefinitely. Despite continued interference with his play, Hunter deserves credit for his early-season performance. Scoring 17.2 points a game on a 51.4 percent field goal percentage, Hunter was clearly demonstrating why he was worth being picked 4th overall in the 2019 NBA Draft. Just before he was injured in late January, he posted a career-high 33 points in a loss to the Bucks. If Hunter can return from his injury with the same level of balance between his strong offensive and defensive game, his future in the league is bright, as evidenced by his recent selection to the U.S. Rising Stars team.\\xa0', 'Guard Ty Jerome', 'After serving as a piece in the trade that sent guard Chris Paul to the Suns this offseason, Jerome headed into the 2021 season as a member of the Thunder. He received a G League assignment early in the year in order to recover from an ankle injury. Having successfully rehabbed, Jerome was recently recalled and has been an effective backup point guard for Oklahoma City, scoring nine, 15 and 13 points in his first three outings since his promotion. His seven assists in his return to NBA action are a record for a player making their Thunder debut.\\xa0', \"\u201cHe can shoot, pass, put on the floor and do so many things,\u201d Thunder starting point guard Shai Gilgeous Alexander said of Jerome. \u201cIt's easy for him to blend in.\u201d\", 'Guard Kyle Guy', 'Having spent most of last year in the G League, Guy earned a spot on the Kings NBA roster this season. Though he is currently fighting for minutes, a bright spot came in late February with Guy posting nine points, shooting four-of-five from the field. However, arguably his most impressive NBA highlight came in the preseason where he hit this buzzer-beater, reminiscent of his many clutch performances for Virginia.\\xa0', 'Forward Mike Scott', 'A longtime NBA veteran, Scott has found himself on top of the Eastern Conference with a bench role on a strong 76ers squad. He has mostly served as a reserve this year but is reliable for a spot start when the team faces injury or fatigue. Known for his three-point ability and steady locker room presence, Scott is in a good position to compete down the stretch with the first-seeded Philadelphia team after 10 years in the league.', 'Center Anthony Gill', 'After stints in Germany and Russia, as well as a 2017 Summer League contract with the Hornets organization, Gill made his NBA debut this season with the Wizards. Though he has struggled to play many meaningful minutes, Gill received his first NBA start when COVID-19 ran through the Wizards roster in late January.', 'Forward Mamadi Diakite', 'After falling under the radar of many NBA scouts and going undrafted, Diakite signed a two-way contract with the Bucks and entered the 2021 season in the G League bubble. In 12 G League games, Diakite averaged a double-double, scoring 18.5 points per game and securing 10.4 rebounds. Also impressive was his average of over two blocks a game.

Additionally, Hernandez is co-chair for the community cohort in Political Latinxs United for Movement and Action in Society. Hernandez\u2019s specific policy proposals include making textbooks free for low-income students \u2014 if not all students \u2014 and securing funding for minority organizations so that they have more financial resources on hand.

He explains that Student Council representatives should communicate more effectively with thes student body. After all, if Student Council doesn\u2019t have the input of the student body, they are limited in the progress they can make. One way Student Council can increase student body involvement is by taking advantage of mass emails. Another of his proposed methods is to encourage representatives to interact with CIOs. While input is crucial, Ryan Alcorn explains that the student body must also understand how the Student Council functions. On this note, he proposes a more accessible legislative process. For instance, he wants to create a one-pager describing parliamentary procedure. And, he wants to require a brief summary and goals of action attached to each piece of legislation. Ultimately, Ryan Alcorn believes that a more accessible Student Council will make it more active and effective.', 'Violette Cadet currently serves as chair of the First-Year Council\u2019s diversity and inclusion board, during which she has planned events for her class and created lists of inclusive clubs on Grounds. In high school, she created a cabaret charity, in which she gave a stage to performance art in order to raise money for a women\u2019s group. Cadet identified a recurrence of resolutions within the current Student Council, but if elected, she hopes to move from resolutions to actual action. By putting Student Council in direct conversation with Contracted Independent Organizations \u2014 clubs and various groups in the University community \u2014 Cadet wants to better identify inefficiencies across Grounds and within Student Council. She also wants to institute an open-door policy in Student Council so that student and community demands are better heard.', 'Nina Santana is a member of the Black Student Alliance, which has allowed her to work with PLUMAS and undocUVA and has given her insight into Black, Indigienous and Latinx communities. Santana served as president for her high school\u2019s student council, and she hopes to use her experience in advocating for the removal of Confederate statues across Grounds, an official land acknowledgement to the Monacan people and increased funding for ethnic studies courses. She would also like to restructure the perception of Student Council among the student body and ensure that student voices are actually heard on Student Council, possibly through holding events where students can come and speak about their experiences to inform Student Council members.', 'Lillian Rojas highly values minority inclusivity. Though she has no experience with Student Council at the University, she intends to rely on her unique perspective as a biracial student. She believes that this identity will allow her to effectively interact with diverse perspectives and ensure she adequately represents University students. With this in mind, she intends to specifically support lower income, DACA and latinx students. In order to accomplish this broader goal, she is interested in using social media and reaching out to multicultural CIOs to better gauge student input. She notes that another marginalized voice on Student Council is first years. Lillian Rojas believes that first years should be much better informed about the role of Student Council, its goals and the action Student Council is taking to accomplish those goals. To conclude, she reiterates that her main goal is to help marginalized students feel included and wants to ensure that all voices are heard.', \"Booker Johnson believes that it is students' voices that matter most \u2014 that\u2019s why a huge part of his platform is focusing on making sure that student voices are no longer pushed aside and are amplified by representatives. His is a voice that would be incredibly valuable to Student Council, as he explicitly notes his intention to protect Black women within Student Council and across the University as a representative. His main focus will be on furthering equity and inclusion, partnering with other representatives and organizations to seek support for first-generation and low income students. Booker\u2019s voice is one that Student Council needs right now, fighting for those students who have been most marginalized.\\xa0\", 'Ella Tynch serves as the communication chair of Young Democratic-Socialists of America at U.Va. In this role, she has advocated for a tuition freeze in light of the COVID-19 pandemic\u2019s hardships and has successfully fought for a credit\/general credit\/no credit policy for Summer 2020 classes. While wanting to keep an open mind to a diversity of opinions, Tynch plans to advocate for students and workers. Her policy proposals include providing payment for Student Disability Access Center notetakers and providing students involvement grants so they may volunteer without interference from having to work a job to cover personal expenses. Tynch says that she plans to be available to the student body and local community \u2014 via town halls, public feedback sessions, holding calls and keeping her inbox open.', 'Amelia Delphos has a clear understanding of the limitations of student government. She demonstrates passion towards better racial equity and increased mental health services at the University. She has no prior experience with Student Council.

He notes that Student Council representatives should not exist to further specific political agendas. Hence, he wants a representative position so that he can defend students against discriminatory rhetoric. Noah Strike believes that both representatives and CIOs should be held accountable for their actions. He specifically mentions the CIO involvement with anti-queer discrimination and surges in COVID-19. To rectify the current discriminatory rhetoric, he wants to educate these groups about the harmful impacts of their actions.

His goal is to increase diversity at the University while simultaneously supporting the already diverse student body in order to ensure all groups are represented. Perry\u2019s goal to increase representation starts with everyone having a seat at the table by having access to their representatives, he says.

The Editorial Board is also endorsing two candidates running for Commerce Representatives for Honor \u2014 third-years Jack Stone and Maggie Regnery, who are running on a joint platform.', 'Christian Smith has already served two terms as an Honor Representative for the College. Smith understands how the system works, and how to effectively enact the change needed to make Honor a more equitable system. While serving, Smith has seen the inequities that exist within the system and how the system disproportionately affects international and marginalized students. As such, Smith\u2019s biggest goal is working towards abolishing the single sanction and moving toward a multi-sanction system. However, he understands that he cannot do this himself \u2014 as such, he wants to work with different organizations around Grounds to have those conversations and set up a working group to make sure people\u2019s voices are heard. He hopes to have legislation written up for the coming year to be sure the issues within Honor are addressed quickly so that students are finally able to have an Honor system that works for them. Smith clearly believes in listening to the student body, which will allow him to implement the changes self-governed students most want to see. \\xa0', 'Gabrielle Bray currently serves as a support officer in Honor, working as both an investigator and a counselor. With her experience on Honor, it is clear that she has a deep understanding of both how the system works, as well as how it impacts students. As such, she wants to work as much as she can to make Honor better, and she knows that there are tangible ways to do this. She addressed how the Informed Retraction affects students in different ways, noting that students who cannot afford to take the time off face the full extent of Honor \u2014 expulsion for a guilty sentence \u2014 while those who can afford it do not and opt for a two-year leave of absence under the IR. As such, she plans to at the very least give a thorough reevaluation of the process, implementing a more accurate polling of the student body to see what her constituents want from Honor. She has a very clear understanding of the issues within Honor, and her experience and ideas make us confident that she will be able to address these issues in a meaningful manner as a representative.\\xa0', 'Andy Chambers has a vast array of experience within Honor \u2014 he currently serves as an Honor Representative for the College and as the vice chair for hearings. He\u2019s been involved in Honor since the first semester of his first year, and has always taken an active role within the organization, co-leading selections and pushing for more diverse support officer pools. This experience allows him to very clearly understand where Honor has faults \u2014 for example, he notes that the main issue with the single sanction is that it simply does not work in a fair and just way. As such, he hopes to move Honor towards a multi-sanction system, offering students a chance to vote on what these different sanctions would be. Further, Chambers notes the major issues that exist with the Informed Retraction, and how it disproportionately affects students who cannot afford to take the time off from the University. Thus, he proposes eliminating the IR entirely or, at the very least, reforming it significantly. The experience that Chambers has, combined with his ability to recognize the issues that exist within Honor, make him an incredibly qualified candidate ready to make Honor a more equitable system.\\xa0', 'Charlotte Paulussen is another candidate with a vast array of experience in Honor. She has been on Honor since her first semester of first year, and has been trained in all three roles, as an educator, investigator and counselor. However, she now focuses in an advising role, as she is drawn to helping students and professors going through the process. Now a senior advisor, Paulussen clearly believes in making Honor work for the student body. It has been through her advising role that she has recognized the inequities that exist within the Honor system, serving as multi-sanction for those who can afford to take an IR and single-sanction for those students who are unable to do so. In relation to these inequities within the IR, she notes that her ultimate goal is to make sure that the sanctions with the IR are educational, whether this be community service or education requirements. If, however, the two-semester leave of absence has to remain, she wants to make sure students taking this absence are equipped with all the resources necessary to be able to return to the University \u2014 in her eyes, students going through the process need to be prioritized. Paulussen also recognizes the disproportionate levels of reporting against marginalized communities, and wants to work with different student organizations on Grounds to make sure this issue is a priority. Paulussen is running for this position for the students \u2014 she knows where the issues are and she knows what needs to be done to address them.\\xa0', 'Jack Stone has been a support officer on Honor since his first year, serving as both a counselor and an investigator. If elected he hopes to implement constitutional changes in order to streamline the process and make it more equitable so cases are never prolonged. Stone also hopes to eliminate the supposed single sanction system that currently exists in order to have a much simpler Honor system. He says the current system, while claiming to be single sanction, actually operates as a multi-sanction system and is very confusing for many students. In eliminating this confusion, he hopes to see more consistent results in Honor. Hoping to give as much due process to students as possible, Stone proposes a triple-sanction system be used where the options are being suspended for one semester, having an entire year of leave or being expelled. He says committee panels would use these sanctions on a case-by-case basis depending on the severity of the case. Lastly, Stone hopes to address the Honor Committee\u2019s disproportionate effect on marginalized students by implementing proper training, getting rid of the student panel and increasing diversity within Honor itself. Based on his previous experience and future aspirations, we are endorsing Stone, as we believe he is a qualified and admirable candidate.', 'Regnery joined Honor as a first-year and is currently serving as an Investigating Coordinator. Like Stone, she also aims to implement a system in order to finish Honor cases much more quickly since prolonging cases is not effective. Additionally, Regnery believes the single sanction system is ineffective, saying that a multi-sanction system would allow for more people to face accountability for actso of lying, cheating and stealing. She also believes that their needs to be increased communication with the University community since these outcomes directly impact them. Further, Regnery also aims to increase diversity within Honor by reaching out to CIOs and improving outreach during the application process. She hopes this will increase the number of LGBTQ+ students and racial and ethnic minorities applying to be on Honor. The Editorial Board believes Regnery is qualified and dedicated to the position.']","456":"['U.Va. Health is participating in phase three of a clinical trial for a COVID-19 antibody cocktail to stop transmission of the novel coronavirus in households where one individual has tested positive. The drug is administered to household contacts of a COVID-19 patient who have been exposed within a four-day period. It has shown promising results of immunity against symptomatic infections.\\xa0', 'U.Va. Health is one of 150 sites in phase 3 of clinical trials for the drug created by Regeneron, a biotechnology company. The cocktail, which includes two different monoclonal antibodies for the spike glycoprotein of COVID-19, can be delivered as a self-administered injection.\\xa0', 'When a patient is infected with COVID-19, the virus invades the body and multiplies copies of itself. The body\u2019s immune system responds to the foreign material with white blood cells, which produce antibodies that \\xa0react to the foreign material if the virus enters the body again. Monoclonal antibodies are copies of the antibodies that are made in a laboratory setting and target specific foreign substances.\\xa0', 'William Petri, professor of Internal Medicine and Pathology and leader of the clinical trials at U.Va. Health, said that the spike glycoprotein, found on the outer surface of the COVID-19 virus, is essential for attachment of the virus to human host cells.\\xa0', \"\u201cThe spike glycoprotein is the Achilles heel of the virus because [the COVID-19 virus] needs that spike glycoprotein in order to attach to the human receptor,\u201d Petri said. \u201c If you can have an antibody that binds to a spike glycoprotein, it can totally prevent the ability of the virus to get inside of a cell, and in fact, that's a real advantage of the approach.\u201d\\xa0\", 'The addition of two different types of antibodies against the spike glycoprotein of the coronavirus decreases the chance of the virus evading the body\u2019s acquired immunity. Additionally, it ensures a level of protection against variants, including the U.K. variant, which arrived in the University community in February.\\xa0', 'It was important for U.Va. Health to join Regeneron\u2019s scientifically driven approach to analyze the potential role of the antibodies, according to Petri.', 'Rebecca Carpenter, fourth-year Medical student and sub-investigator for the study, worked on the project after the pandemic altered her medical school plans, allowing her to continue researching in Petri\u2019s lab during this demanding time.\\xa0', '\u201cI missed interacting with people in the clinical environment and looked forward to getting to do that again,\u201d Carpenter said. \u201cI particularly looked forward to getting to interact with people who are fearful and get to encourage and care for them in the midst of a lot of uncertainty.\u201d\\xa0', 'Physicians from the study reached out to household contacts of COVID-19 patients who had been exposed for a period of four days or less and had not received a previous positive COVID-19 test result.\\xa0', \"\u201cThis study was set up that way because [researchers are] trying to prevent [transmission of] COVID-19,\u201d Petri said. \u201cThe longer that you're exposed, then, the less ... opportunity [there\u2019s] to prevent the infection.\u201d\\xa0\", 'Carpenter was responsible for enrollment of patients for the trial, physical exams and documentation efforts under the supervision of a study physician.\\xa0', '\u201cI swabbed patients for COVID-19 [and] I was frequently told that I was the favorite swabber, which I got a kick out of because I never thought that would be a skill I would perfect,\u201d Carpenter said. \u201cI also helped with study documentation, monitoring after drug administration including vitals and study follow-ups in conjunction with the clinical research coordinator.\u201d', 'Carpenter described that during a patient\u2019s initial visit to the clinic they took a rapid PCR COVID-test, had their blood drawn and received a physical exam. The drug choice was randomly assigned to a patient and then administered. Afterward, the patient would stay in the clinic for an hour so that physicians could monitor their vital signs in case an adverse reaction occurred.\\xa0', 'Following the visit, patients received a weekly COVID-19 test during the first month and were monitored for any adverse effects. After that period, Igor Shumilin, clinical research coordinator for the study, said that further testing only occurred if a patient experienced COVID-19 symptoms during their 7 months with the study.\\xa0', 'Although Regeneron has not filed an emergency-use application to the Food and Drug Administration yet, Petri notes that preliminary data for the study\u2019s first 400 patients indicate promising results. Twenty-four of the study\u2019s 3,500 patients were enrolled at U.Va. Health.\\xa0', 'Results indicated that the antibody cocktail is 100 percent effective in prevention against symptomatic COVID-19 cases, and 50 percent effective at preventing infection overall when factoring in asymptomatic cases. If a patient develops COVID-19 following the cocktail treatment, they are likely to have an asymptomatic case and be infected with lower amounts of the virus.\\xa0', 'Petri indicated numerous benefits of the antibody cocktail including self-administration that would be similar to how diabetes patients use insulin. Fundamentally, he notes that this is the first drug for COVID-19 that enables individuals to care for their loved ones who are infected with the virus without putting themselves at adverse risk. Furthermore, it is an effective treatment given the variability in cases as individuals get vaccinated and new variants emerge.\\xa0', \"\u201cIt's like a stopgap until everybody is vaccinated,\u201d Petri said. \u201cIn part, it\u2019s something that will always be useful because there are always going to be situations where the vaccine\u2019s not 100 percent effective or there's a new variant.\u201d\\xa0\", 'Unlike the COVID-19 vaccine, the antibody cocktail only provides temporary, artificial immunity while the body begins to naturally form antibodies. Petri notes the half-life of the antibodies from the drug is approximately two weeks and serves as a way to jump-start the immune system.\\xa0', \"\u201cThe antibodies are not long-lasting and so this is going to provide protection only for that period of time in which like your roommate or your spouse is infectious,\u201d Petri said. \u201cThat's an important difference from a vaccine, which we're hoping [provides] very long-lived protection.\u201d\\xa0\", 'Petri notes a challenge of the trial was conducting the clinical study in a safe manner that did not put other U.Va. Health patients at risk as COVID-19-exposed participants visited the clinic. He mentioned the key collaboration with Debbie Shirley, division head of Pediatric Infectious Disease and leader of the COVID-19 clinic, to reduce potential exposure to other hospital patients.\\xa0', 'Patients adhered to precautions by wearing masks while the clinic\u2019s staff used personal protective equipment to ensure safety. Additionally, Petri mentioned that patients could easily access the clinic outdoors, and thus did not have to enter the hospital, further decreasing the risk of exposure to others.', 'Petri indicates that the team has been following up with patients since mid-August and will continue to screen them every four to five months, to ensure the safety of participants. As of now, the cocktail has been tolerated well, and researchers have only seen reactions at the injection site.\\xa0', 'Carpenter notes that the next steps for the trial will include determining where resources should be allocated. She is thrilled about the prospect of distributing the drug to places facing extreme isolation such as nursing homes and retirement communities.\\xa0', '\u201cI think the next step is identifying which communities and situations would most benefit from this cocktail to prevent COVID infections and subsequent morbidity and mortality from COVID-19 and also allow maximum return to normalcy in our communities,\u201d Carpenter said.\\xa0']"},"links":{"0":"['https:\/\/www.cavalierdaily.com\/article\/2020\/12\/no-18-virginia-mens-basketball-pauses-season-due-to-covid-19?ct=content_open&cv=cbox_latest',
