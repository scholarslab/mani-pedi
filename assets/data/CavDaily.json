Oct. 6, six weeks from the online start of classes, marked the end of the refund period.' A petition against the prorated refund schedule has been circulating for three months. The petition counters the way that the University has refunded tuition, fees and housing costs \u2014 specifically advocating for students to receive a proportional refund of housing costs if sent home from their on-Grounds housing by the University.' Housing refunds were issued to undergraduate students who did not move into their on-Grounds housing until after Aug. 31. Students received refunds ranging from $255 for first years to $310 for upperclassmen living in the most expensive singles on-Grounds. These refunds were calculated as 7.65 percent of the total amount students had spent on their housing contract for the fall semester.' Dining refunds only applied to All Access meal plans, and ranged from $190 to $200. There was no refund for the Flex Dollars on these meal plans, or the meals on Block Plans \u2014 plans through which a student pre-pays for a set number of meals \u2014 as individual meal swipes and Flex Dollars will carry over to the next semester.' The largest refund was for students who chose to study outside of the Charlottesville and Albemarle area this semester \u2014 for these students, the fall 2020 mandatory fee and student activity fee has been reduced by $660. The mandatory fee covers University facilities and services, such as the University Transit System, classroom maintenance and athletics, while the $39 student activity fee is sent to Student Council for use in student programming.' According to the University\u2019s prorated refund schedule, students will not receive any further tuition and fees refunds if they choose to withdraw or take a leave of absence from the University at any point on or after Oct. 27. \nA petition against this schedule was started by several students when it was first released and has gathered over 1,600 signatures. The petition calls on the University to trade the prorated refund schedule for a proportional one, which would allow students to continue to receive refunds of tuition, fees and\/or housing proportional to the remaining time in the semester \u2014 abolishing the end to refunds that occurred on Oct. 6 under the current schedule. The petition focuses most on the need for the University to refund students\u2019 remaining on-Grounds housing costs, in the case that they are sent home involuntarily at any point in the semester. \n\u201cStudents being sent home in mass should not be refunded in the same manner as students who voluntarily withdraw from the university,\u201d the petition reads. \u201cIn these trying times, families will be heavily burdened with the cost of tuition and housing, and changing the schedule will greatly alleviate some of this burden.\u201d' According to the petition, students should still be able to get 7.65 percent of what they paid in housing for each remaining week that they miss. This contrasts with the current plan, under which students would receive no refund after the sixth week of the semester.' Dhruv Rungta, a first-year College student and organizer of the petition, said that University administration has so far been clear that it is not interested in changing the housing refund policy.' If students are sent home without a proportional housing refund, Rungta plans to contact the University administration again about the petition.', \"\u201cI would honestly just send [the petition] and just be like, \u2018Hey, we've been saying this for months now,\u2019\u201d Rungta said. \u201c\u2018You haven't been listening to us.\u2019\u201d\"","links":"['https:\/\/www.change.org\/p\/university-of-virginia-urge-uva-to-change-its-covid-housing-refund-policy-away-from-the-proration-schedule', 'https:\/\/housing.virginia.edu\/housing-rates', 'https:\/\/studentsongrounds.virginia.edu\/tuition-fees-and-financial-aid', 'https:\/\/sfs.virginia.edu\/institutional-tuition-and-fees-adjustment-schedule-weekly-proration', 'https:\/\/www.change.org\/p\/university-of-virginia-urge-uva-to-change-its-covid-housing-refund-policy-away-from-the-proration-schedule']"},"69":{"url":"https:\/\/www.cavalierdaily.com\/article\/2020\/10\/u-va-reports-56-active-covid-19-cases-in-the-community-43-of-which-are-students","title":"U.Va. reports 56 active COVID-19 cases in the community, 43 of which are students","subtitle":"12 new cases have been reported in the University community since Sunday","img_src":"https:\/\/snworksceo.imgix.net\/cav\/ee7ef180-fa93-4dc5-b30a-e108cfc4bff0.sized-1000x1000.png?w=1000","date":1603929600000,"authors":"['Max Paley']","photo_caption":"\n                            Student isolation rooms are at 3 percent capacity, and quarantine rooms are at 5 percent capacity.\n\n                                                            ","photo_attrib":"[]","text":"The University\u2019s COVID-19 Tracker reported 12 new cases of COVID-19 in the University community between Sunday and Wednesday.

The University also plans to confer degrees to graduating students who are involved in ongoing Honor cases.', \"\u201cAll investigations are going to be moved online through a panel \u2026 if someone is accused, we\u2019ll then pause the case there, because we just don't see a way to fairly hold hearings online at this point in time,\u201d Lyon said during the Committee\u2019s weekly meeting March 29. \u201cAnd so we're going to suspend case processing post-accusation.\u201d\\xa0\" Lyon worries that online hearings could lead to claims of unfairness due to potential technical errors. It would also be logistically difficult to hold hearings online, she added.', \"\u201cThe average Hearing involves 20+ participants and requires very specific timing for different participants' entrances, exits, and participation,\u201d Lyon explained. \u201cAn online format is not well-suited to ensuring that all of these needs are met sufficiently and appropriately.\u201d\" Honor will still be taking new cases, however no case will move beyond the Investigation Panel stage, where three Honor Committee members decide whether a case meets the standards to go to trial.' Previously, when a student was going to graduate while being tried for an Honor offense, their degree would be held until the case was completed and they would not graduate if they were found guilty. Given the unprecedented circumstances that exist due to COVID-19 and the University\u2019s operational changes, however, Honor will not hold degrees, and these students will be able to graduate.', \"\u201cGiven the current circumstances, we'll see if we end up with any fourth-years who are accused prior to when they would normally graduate \u2014 in which case under normal circumstances we would then hold their degree \u2014 but under the current circumstances we intend to confer those degrees,\u201d Lyon said. \u201cAnd then, if the student is later found guilty in a hearing, we\u2019d revoke the degree.\u201d\" Lyon also announced that Honor will donate approximately $2,000 to Student Council\u2019s Hoos Helping Hoos mutual aid network \u2014 which hopes to connect first-generation, low-income, international and working students with resources they may need in the midst of uncertainty due to COVID-19. According to their latest Facebook update March 26, Hoos Helping Hoos has raised over $14,000.', \"\u201c[Honor] will be donating the remainder of the budget for our committee to the Student Council to distribute through their mutual aid program, and the food pantry program and anything else that they're running right now,\u201d Lyon said.\" During past Honor meetings, the Committee had discussed modifying their definition of lying, which is one of three acts that could lead to a student being accused of an Honor violation, including cheating and stealing.' Lying is presently defined as \u201cthe misrepresentation of one or more facts in order to gain a benefit or harm another person, where the actor knows or should know that the misrepresentation will be relied upon by another person,\u201d according to the Honor bylaws.', \"Honor is working to redefine lying to work out \u201csocial lies,\u201d which Lyon described broadly as \u201clies that don't relate to a student's academic or professional prospects.\u201d\" However, due to the outbreak of COVID-19, the Committee has decided that changing the definition would confuse students who have to worry about adjusting to virtual classes, potentially moving back home and staying healthy. \n\u201cTo make such a substantial change at a point in time where people are for good reason preoccupied with other things [...] it would be a bad idea to pass something like this now,\u201d Lyon said.' Law student Todd Truesdale, who initiated the effort to change the definition of lying, thinks that COVID-19 shouldn\u2019t necessarily stop this change.', \"\u201cI think we're still doing our constituents justice through these [weekly Committee] Zoom meetings, and I don't think it would be a particularly bad change, but in the same breath, I understand the concerns about changing something,\u201d Truesdale said.\" Truesdale noted that he will be returning to the Honor Committee next semester and will continue pushing to change the definition then.' Furthermore, Lyon announced in an email that Honor will also be postponing the election of new Executive Committee members until the weekend of April 3. Originally, the terms for the newly elected Committee was intended to begin April 5. That full transition will instead occur some time in mid- to late-April.","links":"['https:\/\/www.cavalierdaily.com\/article\/2020\/03\/honor-ujc-to-suspend-all-cases-while-in-person-classes-are-cancelled', 'https:\/\/www.cavalierdaily.com\/article\/2020\/03\/u-va-moves-classes-online-for-remainder-of-spring-semester-cancels-final-exercises-as-planned', 'https:\/\/www.cavalierdaily.com\/article\/2020\/03\/student-council-mutual-aid-network-u-va-community-food-pantry-available-amid-operational-changes', 'https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pg\/uvamutualaid\/posts\/?ref=page_internal', 'https:\/\/www.cavalierdaily.com\/article\/2020\/03\/honor-pends-voting-on-definition-of-lying-and-establishes-procedure-for-recusals', 'https:\/\/honor.virginia.edu\/frequently-asked-questions']"},"108":{"url":"https:\/\/www.cavalierdaily.com\/article\/2020\/10\/some-athletes-receive-covid-19-tests-three-times-per-week-as-other-students-report-challenges-receiving-tests","title":"Some athletes receive COVID-19 tests three times per week as other students report challenges receiving tests","subtitle":"Athletes on the University\u2019s football, field hockey, volleyball, men\u2019s soccer and women\u2019s soccer teams receive thrice weekly COVID-19 tests","img_src":"https:\/\/snworksceo.imgix.net\/cav\/f062a513-40ee-4842-80cb-392f815e6f18.sized-1000x1000.jpg?w=1000","date":1601769600000,"authors":"['Ali Sullivan', 'Eva Surovell']","photo_caption":"\n","photo_attrib":"[]","text":"New University COVID-19 guidelines went into effect Sept. 23 mandating mask-wearing and barring students and faculty from gathering in groups larger than five or traveling to or from Charlottesville.

The University began random population testing earlier last month, and this week, it began using rapid saliva tests to test both asymptomatic and symptomatic students. \nThe third test performed on football players is administered by an independent third-party testing service, Mako Medical, prior to competitions. \nIn total, Virginia Athletics has reported 64 total cases of COVID-19 \u2014 though the Cavaliers currently have 765 student-athletes, these cases could belong to any student athlete, coach or member of Virginia Athletics\u2019 support staff. \nVirginia football, which was the first program to return for training July 5, has reported three total cases of COVID-19. Ahead of Saturday\u2019s game against Clemson, the team reported that one full-time coach had tested positive and seven student-athletes had either tested positive for or been exposed to the virus, disqualifying them from playing. \nPrior to Saturday\u2019s game, Virginia football\u2019s three cases accounted for 4.6 percent of the cases reported by Virginia Athletics. \nVirginia football is also the only team that Virginia Athletics specifies positive cases for, so the other 61 of Virginia\u2019s 64 cases could belong to any one of the Cavaliers\u2019 26 other varsity programs.

Baseball, softball and cross country are considered \u201cmedium-risk\u201d sports. As such, all team members are required to participate in testing every other week beginning with the week of the first competition against an opposing team.'

As undergraduates and faculty alike begin to feel the effects of the declining motivation and efficacy of video learning, stress will likely start to encroach on their mental well-being.' Fortunately, the mental health and wellness resources offered at the University have made the move online, allowing students to reach out for help even in this age of social distancing. Whether it\u2019s for immediate crisis care from the Counseling and Psychological Service, long-term extended care from the Maxine Platzer\u2019s Lynn Women\u2019s Center or for improving upon your personal wellness at WahooWell, the University is offering students diverse online care to help them throughout the pandemic.' CAPS, the primary mental health clinic for University students, has integrated telehealth into their counseling services where students can speak with licensed counselors through WebEx. According to CAPS Director Nicole Ruzek, CAPS has included new wellbeing groups and drop-in counseling in their move online to ensure the best possible care to students during the pandemic.', \"\u201cWe've partnered with the contemplative sciences folks and we're offering mindfulness groups every day of the week,\u201d Ruzek said. \u201c[We also have] our Let's Talk program \u2026 a [virtual] drop-in program for students [where] they don't need appointment[s] ahead of time \u2026 on Tuesdays.\u201d\" However, the move online has not been without its challenges, as barriers exist to implementing telehealth programming during the pandemic. The requirement to socially distance indoors while students partake in remote learning from all around the world poses a unique trial to counselors and students alike.', \"\u201cI think the main challenge that we faced \u2026 was [that] a number of students who went home to another state and \u2026 we are not allowed to practice outside of the state \u2026 where we're not licensed,\u201d Ruzek said. \u201c[Plus] students are worried about [not having] privacy to do their telehealth sessions.\u201d\" Despite the challenges, the future appears bright as there are talks of legislators creating an exemption for licensing laws across state lines if the care is provided via telehealth. To alleviate privacy concerns for students accessing telehealth services in spaces where they may feel uncomfortable with others listening in, CAPS now allows students living in the Charlottesville area to reserve one of six private offices at CAPS designated spaces for participating in virtual counseling sessions. Any student who uses this space is required to follow social distancing guidelines. \nThe Maxine Lynn Platzer Women\u2019s Center \u2014 which offers long-term counseling services as well as mentorship to the entire student body \\xa0\u2014\\xa0has similarly integrated telehealth to facilitate continuous support for those who seek mental help and mentorship. Abby Palko, the director of the Women\u2019s Center, highlights the new support groups added for the unique pandemic situation as well as how the Center has been circumventing state-line issues of virtual services thus far.' \u201cWe are providing all of our counseling sessions remotely through an online platform \u2026 [or] help[ing] them get set up with a provider in their state,\u201d Palko said. \u201cWe will [also] be starting a couple of groups [such as] wellness in the time of COVID \u2026 [and] the survivors one [will] be a new cohort.\u201d' In the face of additions to virtual programming at the center though, the center is also having to cope with the loss of in-person access to their offices. Typically, the center reserved self-reflection rooms throughout the building for students to use when needed and staff members tried to maintain open-door policies for struggling students \u2014 now, both resources have become inaccessible to the public.', \"\u201cYou know, I finish every interview or meeting with students saying, \u2018You know where to find me. My door is always open to you\u2019 [but now] I have to say, \u2018It's not right now,\u2019\u201d Palko said. \u201c[I\u2019m] happy to jump on a Zoom call with you \u2026 [but] it's not quite the same, and so that is challenging, particularly because so much of the work we do is built on human connection.\u201d\" While most of the programs have focused on counseling services, WahooWell was founded in 2019 and presently focuses on complementing therapy sessions from initiatives such as CAPS and the Women\u2019s Center by helping students create goals to maintain both physical and mental wellbeing. Kristina Simpkins, an early intervention specialist working as a WahooWell coordinator, elaborates on how WahooWell facilitates both physical and mental wellbeing to students during the pandemic when they register to join the program.', \"\u201cWe have conversations about maybe \u2026 you're eating differently because you're in a new living environment and that has shifted your overall wellbeing,\u201d Simpkins said. \u201cHow you want to adjust things to get back to a picture of health and wellness with that specific topic [is what we discuss].\u201d\" The program was initially founded to focus on social health and substance use but has since expanded to be an overall wellbeing program in accordance with the wishes and needs of the students surveyed on Grounds. As WahooWell continues to incorporate feedback from its students, Simpkins encourages people to stay up to date with the website for current projects in the work.', \"\u201cWe've been working on some health and wellbeing guides,\u201d Simpkins said. \u201cThey're around topic areas like taking care of yourself ... getting healthy sleep, all the various topics of well being [and there are] other resources that are on Grounds which I refer to quite a lot through WahooWell.\u201d\" As CAPS, WahooWell and the Women\u2019s Center continue to address the challenges that telehealth and remote learning pose on mental wellbeing, each program hopes to improve upon their in-person assistance that has moved online and add new strategies to effectively aid students in need during this unprecedented time. While students are facing disruption in their regular routine, Palko gives some advice to students who are trying to find normalcy during their academic year.' \u201cThese are challenging times, so please be kind and gentle with yourself,\u201d Palko said. \u201dFor some people, [keeping a strict routine] is how they cope with an uncertain moment like this and for others, they need to cocoon \u2014 I just encourage everyone to do some deep reflection on what helps them.\u201d","links":"['https:\/\/www.nationalgeographic.com\/science\/2020\/04\/coronavirus-zoom-fatigue-is-taxing-the-brain-here-is-why-that-happens\/?fbclid=IwAR27rTnXS-uoOTR8rEh3SuzWNINCy1UAKq0nh25JzWSmcpvEEYaaGF80Uyo', 'https:\/\/studenthealth.virginia.edu\/caps', 'https:\/\/www.brookings.edu\/research\/removing-regulatory-barriers-to-telehealth-before-and-after-covid-19\/', 'https:\/\/womenscenter.virginia.edu\/new-clients', 'https:\/\/www.studenthealth.virginia.edu\/wahoowell']"},"204":{"url":"https:\/\/www.cavalierdaily.com\/article\/2020\/05\/u-va-accepts-11-7-million-from-cares-act-half-will-directly-benefit-students","title":"U.Va. accepts $11.7 million from CARES Act, half will directly benefit students","subtitle":"SFS is currently developing a process to evaluate applications and distribute funds","img_src":"https:\/\/snworksceo.imgix.net\/cav\/892fd3a4-1912-49f7-940e-eb728bd4ad8a.sized-1000x1000.jpg?w=1000","date":1589068800000,"authors":"['Jacquelyn Kim']","photo_caption":"\n                            The University decided to opt-in to the CARES act because the funding will allow U.Va. to support students who are experiencing financial difficulties in light of the pandemic.\n\n                                                            ","photo_attrib":"[]","text":"The University will receive $11.7 million through the federal Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act, or CARES Act, signed into law on March 27 to help mitigate the fiscal impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. In accordance with the Act\u2019s stipulation that half of the aid received must directly benefit students, the University will distribute $5.8 million in aid to students. \nAlthough some universities have declined to apply for funds from the CARES Act, the University decided to opt-in to the CARES act because the funding \u201cwill allow the University to support students who are experiencing financial difficulties as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and help offset significant financial losses the University has incurred,\u201d deputy University spokesperson Wes Hester said in an email statement to The Cavalier Daily.' The University has incurred financial losses in both the academic and health departments, with the University Health System facing an $85 million deficit per month due to a significant drop in surgeries and clinic visits. In response, some non-patient care staff have been furloughed, and the hospital leadership, along with physicians and leaders at the Medical Center, Physicians Group, School of Medicine and School of Nursing, have taken various pay cuts. The University\u2019s senior leadership has also taken a ten percent pay cut. \nUniversities that have declined to apply for funds include Harvard, Princeton, Yale and the University of Pennsylvania \u2014 each among the group of American universities with the top twenty largest endowments. Although the University \u2014 \\xa0with an endowment of $9.6 billion \u2014 is also among those top twenty as one of only four public institutions included, those institutions that declined funding from the CARES Act are all private institutions with endowments significantly greater than that of the University.' The amount each institution received from the CARES Act was in part determined by the number of Pell Grant-eligible students, a metric that correlates to the number of enrolled students from low-income families \u2014 those who have been hit the hardest and left the most vulnerable by the current economic crisis.' According to the Pell Grant Report by the State Council of Higher Education for Virginia, in the 2018-19 academic year, the University had 2,327 students receiving Pell Grants, representing 13.9 percent of the undergraduate student population. During that same academic year, Piedmont Virginia Community College had 1,411 Pell Grant-receiving students, representing 25.9 percent of the undergraduate population, and PVCC received approximately $1.9 million from the CARES Act, with approximately $950,000 directly benefiting students. \nSince shifting to online learning in mid-March, the University has provided eligible students with emergency financial support for \u201ctravel, technology, food, medication and other living expenses,\u201d Hester said. Aid from the CARES Act will be distributed in addition to the emergency financial support already provided by the University.' According to Hester, Student Financial Services is currently developing a \u201csimple and streamlined process to evaluate applications and distribute funds [from the CARES Act] to eligible students as expeditiously as possible,\u201d and information about how to apply for aid will be posted on the SFS website in early May. \nKenzie Cooper, a first-generation and low-income third-year Curry student who will be graduating early this year, plans to apply for aid from the CARES Act. Although she is still receiving income from her Federal Work Study job at a local elementary school, she is only making half of what she had been making before the pandemic due to the elementary school having many days off. \n\u201cRight now, my biggest concern is that I am not going to receive any money since I am graduating and that they will wait until the fall to start the process,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cI did email SFS to check on when they were planning on giving out money, and they basically said that they were still figuring out the process because they have to follow guidelines and reminded me that there are student loans available.\u201d \nCooper, like many upperclassmen at the University, lives off-Grounds, and she is still being held responsible for her rent despite having severely reduced income as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.', \"\u201cI've been stressed because I was hoping for some type of tuition reimbursement \u2026 so it would be nice to get some type of money [through the CARES Act],\u201d she said.\\xa0\" Although the University issued prorated housing and dining refunds for the Spring 2020 semester, tuition refunds were not issued.' \u201cThe University is not saving any money by temporarily providing instruction online,\u201d Hester said in a previous email statement to The Cavalier Daily. \u201cWe are continuing to pay for the costs of in-person delivery while adding costs of online delivery.\u201d', \"The University issued roughly $18 million in refunds to students for unused housing and dining costs, with the University itself directly funding $12 million of those refunds and Aramark \\xa0\u2014 the contractor that oversees most of the University's dining services \u2014 absorbing the remaining $6 million.\\xa0\" The other half of the funding the University received from the CARES Act will be used to address those \u201cextraordinary losses incurred by our auxiliary services for prorated housing and dining refunds given to students for the Spring 2020 semester,\u201d Hester said. \nCooper also expressed concern about returning to her part-time job at a grocery store where she has typically worked during school breaks.' \u201cI really do not feel comfortable going back to work there since my parents are older, and I don\u2019t wanna pass anything onto them,\u201d she said. \u201cI just don\u2019t feel safe going to work in such a busy place.\u201d' Because she is technically still considered an employee at that grocery store, Cooper is unable to file for unemployment. Additionally, despite working a job and being responsible for her own tuition, rent, bills and other expenses, Cooper did not receive a stimulus check through the CARES Act because her parents still claim her as a dependent for tax purposes. \n\u201cI feel like this is a problem...for a lot of [first-generation and low-income] students,\u201d she said. \u201cBeing claimed as a dependent does not make a student financially secure in any way.\u201d' Among those who have also been excluded from receiving aid from the CARES Act are undocumented individuals. Under the act, only those who file taxes with a Social Security number are eligible for aid, and thus undocumented immigrants who file taxes using an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number are left ineligible.' Education Secretary Betsy Devos has stated that aid from the CARES Act can only go to students who are eligible for federal financial aid, thereby excluding undocumented students, including those with DACA status.' \u201c[Her decision] seems especially awful given that she not only excluded undocumented students without DACA, who are usually always first to be thrown under the bus, but she [also] went a step further to prevent students with a status that for the most part is widely accepted for benefits and employment,\u201d said Steven Radilla, third-year College student and incoming president of DREAMers on Grounds.' All students at the University, including DACA students, will be eligible to apply for emergency hardship payments according to Hester. \n\u201cThat fund has multiple funding sources, including philanthropy,\u201d Hester said. \u201cThe CARES funds will not be used for students not eligible for CARES funds.\u201d' According to Radilla, sources of aid have always been available to DACA students, but they have often had to seek out that information themselves \u201cinstead of just receiving it unasked for\u201d as they did in this situation. Although the University has made these financial resources available, \u201csome institutions might not be offering these resources for their students at all, and that\u2019s kind of what Devos\u2019s decision highlighted,\u201d he said.' \u201cIt\u2019s extremely important that universities recognize this vulnerable population and take steps to dedicate administrative staff or an undocu+ student coordinator solely for the protection and benefit of undocu+ students,\u201d Radilla said, adding that an undocu+ student coordinator at an institution would \u201cadvocate for and find resources for undocumented students.\u201d' The existence of an undocu+ student coordinator position assumes that an institution does matriculate all students regardless of status, which could happen at the University soon due to the work of activism from students, including those in DREAMers on Grounds, and community members for many years.' Currently, the University does not matriculate undocumented students without DACA status, and there are 22 undocumented students with DACA status enrolled at the University. However, Gov. Ralph Northam, D-Va., signed a bill in April that expanded in-state tuition to undocumented residents of Virginia, and University President Jim Ryan recently expressed to DREAMers on Grounds his verbal commitment to matriculating, providing financial aid for and supporting undocu+ students.' \u201cDACA has never been a permanent solution, nor has it ever meant that recipients became documented, and [this exclusion from the CARES Act] reminds people why it\u2019s important to advocate for all students regardless of status,\u201d Radilla said.\\xa0","links":"['https:\/\/www.cavalierdaily.com\/article\/2020\/04\/u-va-health-to-furlough-employees-reduce-salaries-due-to-85-million-deficit', 'https:\/\/www.cavalierdaily.com\/article\/2020\/04\/u-va-senior-leadership-to-take-10-percent-pay-cut-in-response-to-financial-losses-due-to-covid-19-among-other-changes', 'http:\/\/endowments.com\/funds\/', 'https:\/\/www.cavalierdaily.com\/article\/2019\/11\/u-va-s-endowment-reaches-all-time-high-of-9-6-billion-in-2019', 'https:\/\/research.schev.edu\/fair\/pell_dom_report.asp', 'https:\/\/www.cavalierdaily.com\/article\/2020\/04\/u-va-anticipates-18-million-in-losses-from-housing-and-dining-rebates', 'https:\/\/www.cavalierdaily.com\/article\/2020\/04\/dreamers-the-case-for-matriculating-undocumented-students-to-u-va', 'https:\/\/www.cavalierdaily.com\/article\/2020\/04\/with-undocumented-virginia-residents-now-eligible-for-in-state-tuition-u-va-is-assessing-its-approach', 'https:\/\/www.cavalierdaily.com\/article\/2020\/04\/dreamers-the-case-for-matriculating-undocumented-students-to-u-va']"},"114":{"url":"https:\/\/www.cavalierdaily.com\/article\/2020\/09\/u-va-reports-238-active-cases-of-covid-19-231-of-which-are-students","title":"U.Va. reports 238 active cases of COVID-19, 231 of which are students","subtitle":"The University\u2019s COVID-19 Tracker added 22 new cases on Thursday","img_src":"https:\/\/snworksceo.imgix.net\/cav\/9d1393dc-52b3-4806-a567-18369a1ce0df.sized-1000x1000.png?w=1000","date":1600905600000,"authors":"['Maryann Xue']","photo_caption":"\n                            607 cases have been reported to the University since Aug. 17 through U.Va.
