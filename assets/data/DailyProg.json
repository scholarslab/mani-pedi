Trackcorona.live is the creation of University of Virginia undergraduates James Yun and Soukarya Ghosh; Bilguunzaya Battogtokh, of Stanford University; and Austin Stout, of Virginia Tech. The four are friends from Arlington\u2019s Yorktown High School. The website features tables and charts updated with real-time data, including recovery and mortality rates and interactive maps detailing the virus\u2019 travels by country and city. \u201cOur intention was to inform people about the growing spread of the virus,\u201d Yun explained. \u201cThis way, people can track the infection rates in real time, as well as hone into specific geographic hotspots using our interactive map. With the amount of attention the virus has gotten, we think it\u2019s important to equip people with the right tool to monitor the situation.\u201d According to the tracker, there are a dozen cases of the virus reported in the United States, with no deaths as of Sunday evening. There have been more than 37,000 cases reported in 25 countries with 814 deaths reported. All but one of those deaths occurred in China, with the other being reported in the Philippines. \u201cThere are lot of students at UVa and other universities who travel a lot, and this way, they can see where the virus is spreading and where it\u2019s active,\u201d Yun said. \u201cThey will be better able to assess their risk levels, depending on where they\u2019re traveling to.\u201d Yun said his friends have discussed their website on Reddit and are using the feedback they\u2019ve received to add features. \u201cWe are currently working on a medical information page to inform the public about the nature of the virus and preventative measures they can take,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to change as we get more ideas and figure out how to make things work.\u201d According to the National Institutes of Health, the virus was first reported in the city of Wuhan in Hubei Province in China. A betacoronavirus, it\u2019s the same genus as the viruses that created Severe Acute Respirator Syndrome in 2003 and Middle East Respirator Syndrome in 2012. The viruses originate in animals. \u201cBoth MERS and SARS have been known to cause severe illness in people,\u201d the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website stated in a Feb. 7 update. \u201cThe complete clinical picture with regard to [coronavirus] is not fully understood. Reported illnesses have ranged from mild to severe, including resulting in death.\u201d Symptoms of coronavirus, according to the CDC, include fever, cough and shortness of breath. They may appear anywhere from two to 14 days after exposure. The first case of the virus being transmitted from one person to another in the United States was reported on Jan. 30, according to the NIH. Confirmed cases have been reported in California, Washington, Arizona, Massachusetts, Wisconsin and Illinois. Six potential cases have been reported in Virginia as of Sunday evening, according to the Virginia Department of Health. Five of those cases tested negative for the virus; one test of a person in Northern Virginia remains pending. On Jan. 30, the World Health Organization\u2019s emergency committee declared the virus a \u201cpublic health emergency of international concern.\u201d \u201cAll countries should be prepared for containment, including active surveillance, early detection, isolation and case management, contact tracing and prevention of onward spread,\u201d committee officials said in the declaration. \u201cThe committee believes that it is still possible to interrupt virus spread.\u201d The committee also recommended that countries not restrict travel or trade based on the available information about the virus. That hasn\u2019t happened. Australia, Hong Kong, Philippines, India, Indonesia, Japan, New Zealand, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Great Britain and Vietnam have restricted travel to and from China. On Jan. 31, the U.S. also restricted travel to and from China for non-citizens. \u201cThe Centers for Disease Control, along with state and local health departments, has limited resources and the public health system could be overwhelmed if sustained human-to-human transmission of the virus occurred in the United States,\u201d the proclamation restricting travel, signed by President Donald Trump, states. \u201cSustained human-to-human transmission has the potential to have cascading public health, economic, national security and societal consequences.\u201d The proclamation noted that in 2019, an average of 14,000 people a day traveled to the United States from China. \u201c[The government] is unable to effectively evaluate and monitor all of the travelers continuing to arrive from China,\u201d the proclamation states. \u201cThe potential for widespread transmission of the virus by infected individuals seeking to enter the United States threatens the security of our transportation system and infrastructure and the national security.\u201d The proclamation also called for orderly medical screening and possible quarantine of persons entering the United States who may have been exposed to this virus. While governments react to the outbreak, Yun said trackcorona.live will provide the most up-to-date information possible. The site uses software that scrapes information from primary sources in China and across the world. It also accesses news sites to provide immediate updates from worldwide sources. \u201cWe\u2019re also trying to get data state by state and finding other sources,\u201d he said. \u201cThere will be more changes to the site as things go along.\u201d For the quartet, the site has been a way to put their education into practice. \u201cWe went to the same high school and we\u2019ve been friends for a long time. This started out as a fun project, but it turned into the site it is today,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re working on it between classes and before and after class. We\u2019re putting our knowledge into practice. It\u2019s been a great learning experience.\u201d","1":null,"2":"Ahead of spring break, the University of Virginia is notifying students, staff and faculty about the potential impact of coronavirus (COVID-19) to study abroad programs and travel. The university is recommending students traveling during the upcoming break from March 6-14 not go to locations with Centers for Disease Control or State Department warning level 3 or higher. Currently, only China and South Korea have a CDC level 3 warning, which recommends people avoid nonessential travel. \u201cWhile we have not cancelled any current or existing study abroad programs, the university will cancel any such programs, even if already under way, at any location for which the CDC sets a warning level 3, or the State Department sets a warning level 3 or 4,\u201d Dean of Students Allen Groves wrote in a email to students. The CDC set level 2 alerts for Iran, Italy and Japan on Sunday, as those countries began experiencing outbreaks. UVa offers dozens of study abroad programs and internships of varying lengths, including several in countries that have begun experiencing outbreaks. The university also is asking that faculty and staff notify their supervisor or department chair if they plan to travel over the break. The university also noted that fear or stigmatization of particular people groups can occur during a viral outbreak, and asked readers to prevent stigmatization by sharing facts, rather than stereotypes, about the disease. Being Asian American does not increase the chance of getting or spreading coronavirus. No cases of the disease have yet been reported at UVa, according to the university. While several people have been screened in Virginia, no cases have been confirmed in the state at this time, according to the Virginia Department of Health.","3":null,"4":"The University of Virginia has canceled all outbound study abroad programs scheduled for its spring break amid coronavirus concerns. In a university-wide email, Provost Liz Magill said that the decision came following March 1 recommendations from the Centers For Disease Control that universities should \u201creconsider\u201d study abroad travel. \u201cWe feel this is the best decision to protect our students and our local community where students will return after their travel,\u201d Magill wrote. \u201cWe are in close, regular communication with those students who are currently abroad on exchange and other programs, regarding how to monitor and assess their current situations based on conditions in the country they are visiting.\u201d Spring break for undergraduates at UVa is scheduled for March 7 through March 15. Faculty, staff and students planning to travel to affected areas are urged to reconsider their plans and to take into account the possibility of travel delays future quarantines or prolonged self-isolation when returning. UVa recommends that faculty and staff share their travel plans with their department chair, dean or manager and it is recommended student organizations to share travel plans with the Office of the Dean of Students. The release also clarifies that UVa is not aware of any coronavirus cases in Virginia and that the safety of the university and Charlottesville community is their primary concern. In a press conference Wednesday morning, Gov. Ralph Northam and other officials in Richmond said that out of the 17 Virginians tested so far for the disease, none have been positive. Guidance is subject to change as the situation evolves, Magill wrote, and updates and resources are available on UVa\u2019s website.","5":"The University of Virginia, Virginia Humanities and the festival are monitoring the public health situation in coordination with UVa Emergency Management, festival staff said in an email Wednesday evening, and are working to ensure the safety of speakers, attendees, volunteers and staff. The festival will take place from March 18 to 22. No confirmed case of COVID-19 has been reported in Virginia or among UVa students, faculty, staff or the local Charlottesville community. Should a case be positively identified, appropriate communications as guided by the Virginia Department of Health will occur, according to the festival. The festival aims to have hand sanitizer available at venues and to protect food and drink, according to the email. \"If you experience symptoms, or have reason to believe you have been exposed to someone with symptoms, prior to the Festival, please seek medical advice and DO NOT attend the Festival,\" the staff wrote. \"Even with these precautions, we cannot guarantee that there will be no risk,\" they wrote. \"Please consider your personal health and that of your family and community as you finalize your plans to join us for the 2020 Festival.\" Staff said they plan to send another update on March 11. People with specific concerns related to the 2020 festival can email email books@virginiahumanities.org. More information about the annual festival, which this year includes more than 120 free programs as well as its headliner events, can be found at vabook.org.","6":"That\u2019s the advice of area schools and the state health department as the coronavirus and its accompanying respiratory illness, COVID-19, spread across the country and officials locally prepare for a potential outbreak. As of Friday afternoon, no one in Virginia has tested positive for the coronavirus; however, testing is ramping up. The Virginia Department of Health said 31 people have been tested so far and 120 people currently are under public health monitoring. Earlier this week, the University of Virginia cancelled study abroad trips over spring break. Area schools are updating their plans developed in response to the H1N1 outbreak in 2008, in which one local child died, and are sending letters home to parents. More than 3,400 people worldwide have died from the virus, which appears to spread through droplets after a person coughs or sneezes, according to the World Health Organization. In the U.S., several states reported their first cases, and outbreaks appeared to widen as health care workers performed more tests. The Thomas Jefferson District Health Department has recommended individuals get a flu shot, make an emergency action plan and stay home if they aren\u2019t feeling well, among other advice. Local, state and federal officials say wearing a face mask is not necessary unless you are ill. Jessica Salah, the department\u2019s health emergency coordinator, said the agency has been planning for pandemic flu since 2004, and those response plans can be adapted for COVID-19. Through pandemic flu planning, Salah said the health department has built strong relationships with community partners, including area school systems, to respond to an outbreak. It\u2019s hard to know yet how the coronavirus\u2019 lethality compares with the flu, which has so far killed between 20,000 and 52,000 people this season in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \u201cWe still have a lot to learn about the virus,\u201d Salah said. The city of Charlottesville said Friday that it will begin meeting weekly with the health department, Albemarle County and UVa to ensure the area is fully prepared. The UVa Medical Center and Sentara Martha Jefferson Hospital both have negative-pressure units, designed to treat people with highly contagious diseases, and say they have plans in place should a patient \u2014 either from in-town or flown in from other parts of the state \u2014 need care. When asked if the hospitals have tested or been able to test any suspected patients, spokespeople referred all questions to the local health district, which said that publicity of testing information does not include specifics on location, such as a certain city or county, in order to preserve confidentiality. Nationally, health care workers have reported lags in their ability to test cases due to, until recently, narrow CDC requirements for who should be tested; a small number of available test kits; and requirements that tests be sent to the CDC lab in Atlanta. Federal officials said Thursday that tests should be administered with a doctor\u2019s note. UVa does not know if anyone is self-quarantining as a precaution. A spokesman for the medical center said that public health monitoring of people who have recently traveled to hotspots is handled by the department of health in coordination with the CDC. Kathryn Goodman, a spokeswoman for the Thomas Jefferson Health District, said officials are working with the state lab, and some private companies, to offer testing, and that the state health department will ensure an ability to \u201ctest everyone who needs to be tested.\u201d The health district has set up a hotline at (434) 972-6261 for questions about COVID-19. It will go live Monday. The health department will staff the hotline from 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Monday through Friday to answer questions and triage calls, Goodman said. People can leave messages that will be returned as soon as possible. If someone is experiencing a medical emergency, they should call 911. In Washington state, which has the most reported cases in the U.S., some school districts have closed down to prevent the spread of the disease. On Friday, the University of Washington cancelled in-person classes for two weeks. The CDC has said childcare and school administrators should work closely with local health officials to make dismissal and large event cancellation decisions, according to its interim guidance for schools. The Albemarle County school division has convened a working group of school and department administrators who are putting the final touches on a plan that will be communicated to the public early next week, a division spokesman said. School divisions in Fluvanna, Greene, Orange and Madison counties all have sent letters home to families about the virus. Charlottesville City Schools has created a webpage with information about COVID-19 and said it is working with the regional and state health departments to monitor and make plans for the illness. School officials also are reinforcing good hand-washing and cleaning practices with students and posting flyers on the topic. \u201cOur goal would be to maintain operations while minimizing student and staff exposure,\u201d the division said on its website. At Greenbrier Elementary, a planned kindergarten field trip to Sentara Martha Jefferson Hospital was postponed. \u201cGiven the current climate of health concerns, I felt it was best to err on the side of caution when making this decision,\u201d Greenbrier\u2019s principal, Pat Cuomo, wrote in a letter to parents. Instead, the hospital sent folks to the school to lead a lesson with students about hand washing.","7":"International travel can be exciting, but it is important to note that some infections occur more frequently abroad compared with the United States. In addition to being up-to-date on routine vaccinations for living in the U.S., it may be important to get additional vaccinations before traveling internationally. You should make sure that routine vaccines have been completed, such as your annual influenza vaccine, a recent tetanus booster (within 10 years) and two lifetime doses of measles\/mumps\/rubella vaccine (which many people born between 1957 and the mid-1980s have not received). Other vaccines\u00a0\u2014 such as hepatitis A, hepatitis B, Japanese encephalitis, meningococcus, rabies, and typhoid\u00a0\u2014 might be beneficial depending on your age, destination, timing and duration of your trip and planned activities. There are also certain countries around the world that require proof of vaccination for yellow fever, meningococcus and\/or polio. Notably, there are also some conditions for which vaccines are not available: examples include malaria, traveler\u2019s diarrhea and the virus causing the current outbreak of COVID-19, also known as the novel coronavirus. So, depending on the destination, it may be very important to seek pre-travel counseling to ensure that you understand steps you can take to reduce your risk of getting sick and how to use any prophylactic medications. Useful resources include the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website (https:\/\/wwwnc.cdc.gov\/travel\/), which provides country-specific information for travelers, including those with specific medical conditions. Your primary care provider may also be able to help determine if specific vaccinations or prophylactic medications are needed. Additionally, there are travel clinics at UVa locations in Charlottesville that are dedicated to providing up-to-date and personalized pre-travel counseling to children and adults, with details listed below. It is important to plan ahead and ensure that there is sufficient time to get any important vaccinations; sometimes this requires four weeks to complete.

Staff members who have traveled to those areas are being asked to self-isolate for two weeks. In a university-wide email, President Jim Ryan said the new travel guidelines will remain in place until April 15. His decision came after two cases were confirmed in the state, and the number of cases continues to climb nationwide. By Monday night, three more cases had been confirmed by the Virginia Department of Health. \u201cOur immediate risk remains low,\u201d Ryan wrote, but the situation is \u201crapidly evolving.\u201d He said a university team is meeting regularly to discuss plans. No cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus that was first discovered in China this winter, have been confirmed in Central Virginia and no people in the region are awaiting test results as of Monday morning, according to the Virginia Department of Health. Worldwide, more than 100 countries have confirmed more than 110,000 cases, according to The Washington Post\u2019s tracker. U.S. cases have climbed past 500. Spring break for undergraduates at UVa started Sunday and runs through March 15. University events during this time are still planned as of this time, Ryan wrote. \u201cAt this point in time, we plan for students to return to Grounds and to resume classes, but we will be making some modifications to mitigate against the risk of exposure to and transmission of the virus, which we will explain in more detail by mid-week,\u201d he said. Several other universities have announced plans to move classes online, limit large events, enact some closures for deep-cleaning and prohibit upcoming domestic and international travel. UVa is not prohibiting university-related domestic travel at this point, Ryan said, but \u201cstrongly discourages\u201d work-related travel, particularly by air, to large gatherings and conferences and to areas experiencing high numbers of COVID-19 cases. \u201cWhile these guidelines apply to university-related travel, we ask members of the community to apply similar judgment in considering personal travel commitments, both internationally and domestically,\u201d Ryan wrote. Guidance is subject to change as the situation evolves, and updates and resources are available on UVa\u2019s website. Amid updated alert levels, Albemarle County Public Schools detailed its three-phase plan for a potential outbreak of COVID-19. \u201cIt\u2019s a phased approach, which allows us to adjust our infection control measures on an ongoing basis to meet the nature of the threat,\u201d said Rosalyn Schmitt, the division\u2019s chief operating officer. The school system of more than 14,000 students is in preparation mode right now \u2014 emphasizing the importance of hand washing and staying home if not feeling well \u2014 and crafting contingency plans for ensuring adequate staffing and a stash of supplies such as hand soap and disinfectant wipes. \u201cWe\u2019re aware of some limitations and have gotten ahead of it and have begun to procure some of those high-demand items such as Clorox wipes and hand sanitizer,\u201d she said. The division will work with local and state health departments to decide when to move into the different phases. The plan will be updated as more information becomes available and has been posted on the division\u2019s website at k12albemarle.org\/acps\/division\/Pages\/COVID-19.aspx. In the next phase, parents are advised to prepare for the possibility of having to secure child care over days or weeks. At the schools, disinfectant measures would increase, as well as screening measures for students and staff. Closing schools would be a last resort and could occur in the third phase of the plan, which would potentially kick in if someone locally tests positive for the virus. \u201cWe know that the possibility of school closure is on the minds of a lot of families right now,\u201d Schmitt said. \u201cAt this point, we will work closely with the health department to make that decision. We know the closure of a building would be pretty disruptive.\u201d Principals have been asked to identify an isolation room in their schools, which could be used to physically separate those showing symptoms of the virus before they can be picked up. \u201cIf we all work together, we can get through this,\u201d Schmitt said.","9":"Update 3\/12\/20: UVa said it will make a decision about Final Exercises by April 15; is looking at offsetting dining and housing costs for students who return home; will continue to pay work-study students who are unable to work; and will ensure all students are able to complete the term. More information about adjustments and accommodations can be found on UVa's website. The University of Virginia is the latest college or university to shift classes online as officials ask institutions to batten down the hatches in the face of a widening pandemic. Wednesday afternoon, the university sent a memo to students, staff and faculty that no classes would be held on Grounds \u201cfor the foreseeable future, quite possibly through the end of the semester,\u201d as the country and Virginia battle the novel coronavirus. No cases have yet been confirmed in Central Virginia, according to the Virginia Department of Health, and UVa originally hoped to let students return to Grounds and make it through the semester without a local case, but officials said they felt such a move would create too much risk to local resources. Online classes will begin March 19, according to the university, effectively extending the typical week-long Spring Break, which began March 7. \u201cPut simply, UVa has never encountered something quite like this,\u201d President Jim Ryan said in the memo. \u201cThere is no roadmap for trying to put most of the university curriculum online in a week.\u201d Ryan emphasized that the university and its hospital will remain open, and that students who cannot return home will be able to stay in university housing. He also said that students on financial aid who need help returning to their hometowns will receive financial assistance. Students who are away on Spring Break are strongly encouraged to return home or to remain home if they are already there; students who are in town are strongly encouraged to return home by this weekend. People who need to return to UVa to collect belongings will be able to do so. Ellie Brasacchio, the Student Council president, said she respects the university\u2019s decision but said she wishes students had been more involved the the decision process and feels there are many more details that still need to be explained. \u201cThe biggest question that Student Council will be asking the university administration is how this will affect student workers and contracted employees, like those working in the dining hall,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are advocating that all workers receive paid sick leave, including student and contracted workers.\u201d For now, Brasacchio said, the council is working on getting more information for students and is setting up a mutual aid program on Facebook to connect students and other members of the university community with transportation, gas and food as needed. She said she still hopes to be able to return to Grounds for the end of the semester and Final Exercises; for now, university events with more than 100 people are prohibited for the foreseeable future and should be postponed, cancelled or offered virtually. Prospective students are already affected; tours Wednesday and moving forward were canceled. UVa\u2019s admissions office said it would work with prospective students to connect them to virtual tours and other resources. One marquee event, the April unveiling of the university\u2019s Memorial for Enslaved Laborers, will be postponed, the President\u2019s Commission on slavery and segregation announced Wednesday afternoon. The Miller Center of Public affairs also said it would postpone upcoming March and April events. UVa has already asked staff to restrict domestic and international travel in order to avoid spreading or coming into contact with the virus. Faculty will hear more from school deans about how to move classes online and how to receive necessary training and technology; the university said \u201csome research will be put on hold,\u201d but hopes to have core research continue. Some essential labs in departments, according to professors and researchers at staff meetings on Wednesday, will remain open, with additional safety protocols. Some faculty had begun preparing to shift to online formats before UVa\u2019s official announcement. Siva Vaidhyanathan, a professor of media studies, said that as universities across the country began making changes, he decided to start reformatting his syllabus and grading rubric. He said online instruction is typically harder than face-to-face, but that faculty and students seem to have seen the decision as inevitable. \u201cIt became pretty clear universities would become hothouses of infection as soon as students came home from Spring Break,\u201d he said. \u201cWe really needed four weeks to prepare for this; instead we get four days.\u201d Vaidhyanathan said he\u2019s familiar with many online teaching methods, and plans to shift to a series of micro-assignments based on readings and videos for students who will no longer be able to go to in-person discussions or the library. He\u2019ll also host office hours and advising hours on Zoom or Skype. He said that he thought most faculty would be able to muddle through the basic changes needed, but said he worried about the ability of STEM faculty and service staff to manage the change. \u201cIt isn\u2019t that scary or unfamiliar to me, but the fact I\u2019ve done it time and time again shows me it\u2019s a lot harder to teach this way,\u201d he said. Athletics and events at the John Paul Jones Arena, however, will move forward as planned for the time being, according to the university, but restrictions \u201cremain under discussion and consideration.\u201d Vaidhyanathan said he viewed the decision to continue athletic events as \u201cdangerous and irresponsible.\u201d \u201cIs a baseball game a less likely vector for infection than a lecture?\u201d he said. For the time being, according to the university, staff should continue reporting to work as usual. It is not yet clear if or how staff who are sick or who have hours reduced will be compensated. Some faculty and staff may be able to telework; it is not currently clear how many employees the university estimates are able to telework. In 2018, according to Hamilton Lombard at UVa\u2019s Weldon Cooper Center, an estimated 236,778 Virginians \u2014 or about 2% \u2014 worked primarily from home. Many others may have a flexible arrangement where they occasionally or a couple times a week work from home, he said. Virginia so far has nine confirmed cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. In a press conference Wednesday morning, Gov. Ralph Northam sought to reassure residents and said he was not yet ready to declare a state of emergency. Other major universities across the country, including Harvard University, Columbia University and Princeton University, have announced that they would shift some or all of instruction online and close various parts of campus down. UVa was the first Virginia university to make the move; later on Wednesday, the College at Wise, Virginia Tech and Radford and James Madison universities announced they also would change operations and shift online. Elsewhere in Charlottesville, the Virginia Festival of the Book, which is affiliated with the university, on on Tuesday became the first major local event to cancel. UVa has launched a new website designed to keep the public informed about its response to COVID-19. UVa Health also has created a website about the virus, with information for patients including frequently asked questions about the coronavirus, steps to protect health and where to find additional information. \u201cUVa Health\u2019s Epidemiology and Emergency Management teams have together developed a response plan. The plan is being updated regularly based on the latest updated from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Virginia Department of Health (VDH). Our goal is to protect the health of our patients and team members and quickly identify anyone who may need to be tested for the coronavirus,\u201d according to a statement on the website. This week, Piedmont Virginia Community College and K-12 schools in the area began sharing their pandemic plans, but none have yet announced plans to close or substantially change activities. A PVCC spokeswoman said the college leadership team is meeting daily and monitoring other organizations\u2019 decisions; a decision about operations should come within the week.","10":"The decision was made in response to the spread of the COVID-19 virus. The College will revisit the issue on April 5 to determine if the situation should continue. Faculty will be given a week to prepare their courses for online delivery, and they will receive any assistance they need to make the switch to online instruction before the courses go completely online on March 23. The college is also cancelling non-essential travel for employees and students, and gatherings or events with 100 or more people will also be cancelled or postponed. \u201cWe feel we are taking the right action to ensure the health and safety of our students, faculty, staff, and our community,\u201d said Chancellor Donna P. Henry. \u201cWhile we have not received word of a positive COVID-19 case in Wise or on campus, we plan to follow guidelines from the University of Virginia, the Virginia Department of Health, and the Centers for Disease Control to prevent its spread. We will reevaluate the situation in coming weeks and will make further decisions as Virginia and the nation deals with the virus.\u201d","11":"When the day started, ACC fans were hopeful their men\u2019s basketball conference tournament would continue amid concerns about the rapid spread of COVID-19. ACC Commissioner John Swofford called the situation fluid Thursday morning, but said he expected games to be played in Greensboro, North Carolina. Around noon, Florida State players warmed up to take on Clemson at 12:30 p.m. A few minutes later, the Seminoles were sporting frowns as they held the ACC championship trophy in an odd sequence of events. The ACC canceled its men\u2019s basketball conference tournament and named the Seminoles the conference champions without them playing a minute of a game in the conference tournament. \u201cThis is really bigger than just from an athletics standpoint,\u201d FSU head coach Leonard Hamilton said. \u201cThis is a worldwide epidemic.\u201d A few hours later, the ACC announced that it had suspended all athletic activity until further notice. That includes competitions, practices and recruiting. \u201cThis is uncharted territory and the health and safety of our student-athletes and institutions remains our top priority,\u201d Swofford said. \u201cThis decision is aimed to protect from the further spread of COVID-19.\u201d The University of Virginia quickly followed the ACC\u2019s statement with a statement of its own, announcing that it would suspend all athletic activity until further notice. \u201cWe understand this is unusual and unprecedented; however, these are extremely unusual times,\u201d Virginia athletics director Carla Williams said. \u201cThese decisions will be reviewed on a daily basis as circumstances change. This is not ideal for anyone, but the goal is to preserve and protect the health and safety of as many people in our athletics family and beyond as possible.\u201d Earlier Thursday, Virginia Governor Ralph Northam declared a state of emergency in Virginia due to the spread of COVID-19. On Wednesday, UVa announced that it was moving classes online beginning on March 19, and that classes on grounds were not happening for the foreseeable future. UVa\u2019s athletic announcement means events such as the women\u2019s lacrosse team\u2019s Thursday night game against No. 4 Syracuse won\u2019t happen. The softball team won\u2019t host North Carolina this weekend. The baseball team won\u2019t travel to Pittsburgh for its weekend series. The men\u2019s basketball team won\u2019t compete in postseason play this week like everyone assumed it would. For UVa fans with questions or concerns about their purchased tickets to events, the school recommends contacting the UVa ticket office by phone at 800-542-8821 during standard operating business hours or by email at uvatickets@virginia.edu. Not long after the ACC and UVa\u2019s announcements, the NCAA announced that they were canceling both the NCAA men\u2019s and women\u2019s basketball tournaments as well as all remaining winter and spring sports, effectively ending the 2019-20 NCAA athletic year. \u201cWe will have more opportunities to play basketball, but the down side of some of the circumstances that could happen as a result of us not being cautious, not being properly cautious, would be something that we don\u2019t want to deal with,\u201d Hamilton said.","12":"Charlottesville and Albemarle have canceled class Monday as state cases of the novel coronavirus climb and the city and county declared local emergencies. The school divisions made the announcement Thursday morning as Gov. Ralph Northam declared a state of emergency in the face of a widening pandemic. As of press time, the Virginia Department of Health has identified 17 positive cases of COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by the novel coronavirus. None of those cases currently is in Albemarle, Charlottesville or surrounding counties, but health officials have said they expect widespread illness throughout the U.S. and are taking extreme precautions in order to slow the spread and allow time for social services to react. In Albemarle County and Charlottesville, teachers will be developing instructional materials for students who could be at home for an extended period of time, and division staff are planning how to deliver meals to students who participate in the free and reduced meals program. \u201cWe are preparing \u2014 and we ask you to prepare \u2014 for the possibility of extended school closures following health department guidance,\u201d Charlottesville superintendent Rosa Atkins said in a letter to parents. \u201c \u2026 As our community moves forward, we know that these changes are stressful, there will be challenges, and we will get through it together.\u201d High school programs at the Charlottesville-Albemarle Technical Education Center are canceled Monday as well, but adult education and apprenticeship programs will proceed, according to a social media post from CATEC. Albemarle said in a note to families that it will assess whether to open schools Tuesday or remain closed. That decision is expected no later than Monday. The county School Board also called off its meeting Thursday night, pushing a slew of presentations to the April 16 meeting. In Albemarle, students in sixth grade and higher have a school-issued laptop that they can take home, but access to the internet is not guaranteed throughout the county. In Charlottesville, students in third grade and up receive a laptop, but the devices only go home at Walker Upper Elementary, Buford Middle and Charlottesville High School. The Greene County school division also announced Thursday that it is using a scheduled professional development day Monday to deep clean schools and for staff planning and canceling all extracurricular activities until April 12, though that does not include athletics. Many schools across Virginia and the country are taking similar steps amid widespread concerns about the coronavirus. Schools in Richmond and Henrico County will be closed for at least two weeks, as well as public schools throughout the state of Maryland. Decisions to close local schools will be made in conjunction with local public health officials. In addition to canceling for a day, school systems also are nixing field trips outside the area and school events with 100 people or more, and haven\u2019t said how long the restrictions will be in place. Earlier this week, Albemarle schools unveiled a three-phase plan as it seeks to plan and respond to the virus. On Wednesday, it moved to the second phase, which entails sending students and staff home who have the flu and instituting social distancing to limit physical contact among students. State guidance says school should close for at least three days in the event that a student or employee tests positive for COVID-19, according to Albemarle County. For Monday, Charlottesville\u2019s after-school program CLASS will have a full-day program for students already enrolled in CLASS. \u201cAs we take these steps, it is important to remember that children appear to be only mildly impacted by the coronavirus,\u201d Atkins wrote. \u201cThe health department\u2019s guidance to us is designed to mitigate the spread of the virus to keep our entire community safe, especially older adults and individuals with underlying health issues. These recommendations may change as we learn more from the health department and other authorities.\u201d Albemarle students enrolled in the school\u2019s Extended Day Enrichment Program for holidays can attend the program, which will be offered Monday in the Greer Elementary School gymnasium from 7 a.m. to 6 p.m. Only students registered for the program are eligible to attend and should bring lunch and snacks with them. Local emergencies At 5 p.m. Thursday, Charlottesville declared a local emergency, which activates a regional emergency operations plan to coordinate resources between the city, Albemarle and the University of Virginia; Albemarle\u2019s County Executive Jeff Richardson declared a local emergency. Board of Supervisors did not meet Thursday, but a spokeswoman said the board can ratify a local declaration after the fact, and that declaring an emergency helps the county stay aligned with state efforts. City Council unanimously approved the declaration of a local emergency prior to a budget work session on Thursday. Declaring a local emergency gives more authority to local governments to respond to such situations, including freeing up funding opportunities for regulating food and commodity distribution and prices. The local declaration will last no longer than 45 days, at which point it can be extended. Because the city is about to kickoff public hearings for the budget for fiscal 2021, which starts July 1, Mayor Nikuyah Walker urged communications staff to come up with a plan to maintain community engagement. \u201cIf we have to limit the number of citizens who can participate, if they need to call in, email, Facebook live or whatever,\u201d she said. As of Thursday evening, officials said that Monday\u2019s City Council meeting will still go forward as planned. It includes the first public hearings on the city\u2019s proposed tax rate and budget for fiscal 2021. While some have floated the idea of electronic participation in the meeting, state code would prohibit such a measure. The law requires a quorum of councilors to be physically present, which would allow only two of them to participate remotely. During the meeting, Councilor Lloyd Snook asked health department officials what would trigger an order or recommendation to lockdown city facilities, including schools. \u201cIt\u2019s all going to depend on the situation, to be honest,\u201d said Ryan McKay, a senior policy analyst with the state health department. Snook asked for some guidance on best practices for either preemptively canceling school and events or waiting because cases haven\u2019t hit the city yet. McKay said if a local case emerges, the agency would investigate and find out where the person went and who they interacted with. Officials would recommend a self-quarantine for those who interacted with the person and for businesses to close for deep cleanings. \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of where the person was during that incubation period,\u201d he said. Albemarle also is postponing indefinitely the Yancey School Community Center One-Year Celebration that was scheduled for Saturday and is evaluating other gatherings expected to exceed 100 attendees. Kathryn Goodman, spokeswoman for the Thomas Jefferson Health District, said the health district has been working with the city and updating the City Council about how to prepare for the virus. The health district held a meeting with community organizations on Thursday to provide information on the virus and answer questions. \u201cI think at this point the biggest message is the public should prepare in general for any type of emergency,\u201d she said.","13":"The game against the Cardinals turned out to be much more than just the final home game of their careers. It turned out it was the end of Virginia\u2019s season. \u201cToday, NCAA President Mark Emmert and the Board of Governors canceled the Division I men\u2019s and women\u2019s 2020 basketball tournaments, as well as all remaining winter and spring NCAA championships,\u201d the NCAA said in a statement on Thursday afternoon. As COVID-19, the disease caused by a novel coronavirus, continues to spread across the nation and world, the NCAA deemed the drastic measures necessary. \u201cThis decision is based on the evolving COVID-19 public health threat, our ability to ensure the events do not contribute to spread of the pandemic, and the impracticality of hosting such events at any time during this academic year given ongoing decisions by other entities,\u201d the statement said. The NCAA\u2019s decision makes it impossible for the Virginia men\u2019s basketball and men\u2019s lacrosse teams to defend their national championships this season. Both squads were ranked within their respective top-25 polls this week. The 2019-20 college sports season is effectively over. Earlier Thursday, UVa announced the suspension of all athletic related activity. The ACC announced the same suspension for all conference members minutes before UVa. \u201cWe understand this is unusual and unprecedented; however, these are extremely unusual times,\u201d Virginia athletics director Carla Williams said in a statement. \u201cThese decisions will be reviewed on a daily basis as circumstances change. This is not ideal for anyone, but the goal is to preserve and protect the health and safety of as many people in our Athletics family and beyond as possible.\u201d Multiple professional sports leagues, including the NBA, also have announced that they have suspended play for the time being. A few days ago, Virginia men\u2019s basketball players were hopeful to compete in the ACC Tournament and the NCAA Tournament days later. Key discussed his goal of winning the whole thing. He felt confident in how the Cavaliers were playing. With the NCAA\u2019s decision to help slow the spread of COVID-19, Key and the Wahoos won\u2019t take the floor again this season. \u201cThis is uncharted territory,\u201d ACC commissioner John Swofford said, \u201cand the health and safety of our student-athletes and institutions remains our top priority.\u201d","14":"Last Friday, Emma Gallaugher returned to her family\u2019s home in Stuarts Draft for what was supposed to be a regularly scheduled Spring Break from the University of Virginia in Charlottesville. Those plans changed on Wednesday afternoon when the university announced no classes would be held in person \u201cfor the foreseeable future, quite possibly through the end of the semester\u201d in the wake of coronavirus (COVID-19), a respiratory illness. Classes will move online beginning Thursday, according to the university, extending the week-long Spring Break that began last Saturday. Gallaugher, a first-year student in UVa\u2019s school of architecture, described Wednesday\u2019s announcement as an \u201cinsane day.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s definitely a lot of emotions right now \u2014 a lot of stress because I don\u2019t know what this is going to look like with online classes,\u201d she said. \u201cIn terms of architecture, it\u2019s definitely going to be an adjustment. Our main class is studio which meets twice a week for about three hours, and it\u2019s very personal and hands on.\u201d Having only taken one online class in high school, Gallaugher said the online college courses will be an adjustment. \u201cTo think about having to do everything that we have to do for classes online in your house where there\u2019s all the extra distractions and family stuff going on is definitely going to be an adjustment,\u201d Gallaugher said. \u201cThere is part of me that believes it somehow might be harder because you\u2019re not getting that personal teaching from a professor. I definitely think there\u2019s going to be a new level of difficulty that I\u2019ll have to adjust with and learn who I am as a student.\u201d Gallaugher plans to maintain her usual \u201cin class\u201d hours while completing online courses from home \u2014 and although she\u2019s anticipating some difficulty in navigating online classes, she says she\u2019s not scared of the coronavirus. \u201cI think that our country does an amazing job at taking the proper precautions, and I think that\u2019s what the university is doing as well,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re putting students first and making sure that we\u2019re healthy. I\u2019m happy for safety and security and making sure that they are watching over students who are abroad or traveling back.\u201d","15":"Before venturing out, however, it\u2019s always a good idea to check with the venue to make sure the event you want to attend is continuing as planned.

Starting Monday, Monticello will be closed until at least March 30, according to a news release. Montpelier\u2019s closure will begin Saturday and does not have a date set for reopening. \u201cLike the growing list of cultural institutions, athletic leagues and businesses that have elected to close, we know this is the socially responsible thing to do,\u201d Monticello\u2019s release reads. Tom Tom The Tom Tom Summit & Festival, scheduled for next month, is postponed to Sept. 21-27, the organization announced Friday in response to the growing pandemic. \u201cOur team is working with our speakers and collaborators to preserve as much of our previously announced program as possible,\u201d organizers wrote in the announcement. Tickets purchased for the April event can be transferred to the fall, and event organizers are working on a refund plan for events that aren\u2019t rescheduled. United Way\u2019s tax aid The United Way of Greater Charlottesville is suspending its free tax preparation program. The program relies heavily on University of Virginia student volunteers. Because UVa has suspended classes on Grounds for the foreseeable future, the program is unable to operate. The United Way said in its announcement that it\u2019s working to find other tax preparation resources that could be available for the community. \u201cEvery effort will be made to contact and reschedule all taxpayer appointments already booked,\u201d the nonprofit wrote, directing individuals seeking tax preparation and filing services to myfreetaxes.com or freetaxusa.com. Parks and recreation Charlottesville\u2019s Department of Parks and Recreation is suspending or canceling a range of classes, programs and events, starting Monday.

Recreation centers and community housing sites will remain open, though some specific programs at centers might be cancelled. All parks and trails and Meadowcreek Golf Course also will remain open for the timebeing. In Albemarle County, all parks, trails, dog parks and boat launches will remain open at this time, according to a news release. However, starting Monday and lasting until at least April 5, the county is suspending all classes, programs, youth and adult sports leagues and picnic shelter\/facility rentals.","17":"Local schools had planned to use Monday to plan for a possible school closure, but Gov. Ralph Northam changed the timeline when he ordered every public school in Virginia to shut down for the next two weeks \u2014 a decision that will have wide ramifications throughout the area as thousands of children stay home. As students left school Friday, many plans were up in the air, such as how online learning would work when access to internet and technology isn\u2019t equal or how the thousands of students who rely on the schools for regular meals will be fed. Nearly 2,000 Charlottesville students and 4,200 Albemarle County students qualify for free or reduced-priced breakfast and lunch. More information about plans to deal with the closure are expected Monday. Virginia has been granted a federal waiver from requirements dictating that meals to students must be provided on site. On Friday, the Virginia Department of Health announced that it had identified 30 positive cases of the virus in the state, almost double from the day before, as the pandemic continues to grow. No local cases have been identified as of press time Friday. School-based childcare will no longer be provided Monday, and Albemarle County school buildings will be open Monday and Tuesday to staff and families who need to pick up personal belongings or medications. After Tuesday, schools will no longer be accessible to the public, but all non-school offices will remain open and accessible for the duration of the closure. Ten other states have ordered schools closed for an extended period in time as governments look to slow the spread of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus that has upended Americans\u2019 lives. \u201cIt has become clear that we are dealing with an unprecedented event,\u201d Louisa County schools Superintendent Doug Straley said in a letter to families. Straley decided to close Louisa schools for two weeks shortly before Northam\u2019s announcement. Jonathan Kipnis, a professor at the University of Virginia in the Department of Neuroscience, has two children in Albemarle County schools. He and his wife can work remotely so childcare is covered, he said. \u201cWe are lucky,\u201d he said. \u201c\u2026 Extraordinary times require extraordinary measures. It\u2019s the right thing to do.\u201d Kipnis was concerned earlier in the week when his daughter\u2019s band trip to Disney World was still on the calendar but had planned to not let her go. He said he explained to her and her friends what a pandemic is and what\u2019s special about the virus. \u201cIt\u2019s not about us,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to make sure we don\u2019t spread it.\u201d Looking ahead Charlottesville City Schools said it will have meals program in place for families in need beginning Tuesday. The PB&J Fund and parent-teacher organizations are putting together a lunch delivery for Monday. Monday will no longer be a work day for county school staff, but Charlottesville teachers who are healthy are expected to show up to work, a city spokeswoman said. When schools are closed, division staff will use the time for deep-cleaning buildings and to plan for continued learning. \u201cWe are working closely with the Virginia Department of Education to determine the best way to minimize disruption to learning and also to ensure that students in need have access to meals over the closure,\u201d Rosalyn Schmitt, Albemarle County\u2019s chief operating officer, wrote in a letter to families. \u201cWe will share more details as those plans evolve.\u201d State education officials said they will seek to provide each division flexibility to address local needs and to minimize disruptions to instructional time. School systems are required to provide 180 days or 990 hours of instruction. From Saturday to March 27, all weekend, evening and after-school activities are canceled, as is all community use of Albemarle school facilities. The Charlottesville school division is canceling all facility rentals starting Sunday. Private schools Some private schools in the area are following the state\u2019s lead and shuttering campuses for several weeks, switching learning to online classes. St. Anne\u2019s-Belfield School announced Friday that students who board at the school will be sent home for the rest of the school year, and all school activities are suspended until April 3. Additionally, St. Anne\u2019s Headmaster David Lourie said in an email to families that a preschool family is showing symptoms consistent with COVID-19, but the family\u2019s physician has not confirmed the diagnosis with testing. Availability of tests for the virus has been limited, but the federal government moved Friday to speed up the development of more tests. \u201cWe believe this is a prudent measure, allowing us time to assess further the evolution of this illness in our local area, to continue to clean and disinfect our facilities, and to facilitate social distancing after spring break travel,\u201d Lourie wrote. Starting March 23, the school will implement a distance-learning program for all students. The intervening week will be spent preparing faculty for the transition, Lourie wrote. The school offers a seven-day boarding for high school students. This school year, 86 students lived on campus and were from Canada, China, Kenya, Korea, the United States and Vietnam, according to the school\u2019s website. Lourie said the decision to close the school\u2019s dormitory was \u201cheart-wrenching,\u201d but came at the strong recommendation of health professionals. International boarding students will be supported in traveling home for the rest of the school year. St. Anne\u2019s is on spring break this week. The school will continue to monitor the pandemic and reassess the situation closer to April 3. \u201cTo call this situation and these circumstances unprecedented is a gross understatement,\u201d Lourie wrote. More information about how St. Anne\u2019s is preparing can be found at stab.org\/explore\/coronavirus-updates. The Blue Ridge School in Greene County announced this week that it will be closed until March 29. Students are to remain off campus and will be taking classes online.","18":"The University of Virginia is expecting to make a decision about graduation ceremonies by April 15 as it continues to assess and respond to the COVID-19 pandemic, but right now, it is asking for parents to make sure students return home after the university decided Wednesday to suspend classes on Grounds. \u201cWe are especially concerned right now about students living off Grounds,\u201d wrote Patricia Lampkin, UVa\u2019s chief student affairs officer, in a message to parents Friday. \u201cLast night, a number of students were celebrating on the Corner, and a rumor is circulating about more gatherings this evening.\u201d Lampkin asked parents to help their students understand the dangers posed by the virus and how they potentially could infect other residents in the local community. COVID-19 is a respiratory illness caused by the novel coronavirus and it can be severe or deadly in older people or those will underlying health conditions. Experts have said the best way to slow the spread of the virus is through social distancing or limiting the physical contact between people. Earlier this week, UVa joined hundreds of universities and colleges across the country that have effectively shut down their campuses to help curb the spread of the virus. The university\u2019s spring break was supposed to end Sunday, but has been extended through Wednesday. Online classes will begin Thursday. On Friday, the university issued its plea to parents. \u201cWe made the very difficult decision to move our classes to virtual instruction not only based on the health and welfare of our students, but also because we want to ensure that the UVa Health System, a Level 1 trauma center, is not stretched too thin in the coming weeks and months,\u201d Lampkin wrote. \u201cWe believe the fewer students in Charlottesville right now, the better for our health system and, thus, for the health and welfare of everyone in the region.\u201d At the UVa Medical Center, doctors have set up a COVID-19 clinic. Anyone who may be concerned about symptoms should call the hospital at (434) 982-6843 first. Then, based on a screening, medical staff would decide whether to direct patients to the clinic. The screening criteria at UVa hasn\u2019t changed. Visitors to patients at the Medical Center will be restricted as the hospital steps up precautions. As of 5 p.m. Friday, patients are now limited to two designated visitors. Visitation at the university\u2019s transitional care hospital, which provides long-term care for patients with serious medical conditions, was suspended Thursday. UVa is expecting that a small number of students will have to remain in on-campus housing and has said it will support those students through scaled-back services. Libraries also will remain open; however, locations that depend on student workers could close. Students who need to stay have to notify UVa by Wednesday. More information about the university\u2019s response is at virginia.edu\/coronavirus. Lampkin said UVa has enlisted the help of landlords and alumni who manage Greek housing to ensure students return home. Provost Liz Magill wrote in an update Thursday that she expects UVa to complete the semester on time. Faculty and staff also should plan to report to work as usual, but the university is encouraging managers to consider work-from-home options for staff. To prepare for online classes, UVa is surveying faculty to determine the support they need for the transition and providing assistance. UVa\u2019s Center for Teaching Excellence also is hosting webinars to help faculty members. Additionally, the university is working to identify and support students who might not have access to the internet. A working group is looking into how to offset dining and housing costs for students, but specific details on what that would look like have not yet been released. \u201cThe immediate focus has been on protecting the health of our students, faculty, staff and Charlottesville neighbors and continuing the delivery of teaching, research and clinical care,\u201d university officials wrote in an FAQ about the virus. Lampkin said in her letter that in her 40 years at UVa, she has never faced a crisis like this one. \u201cWe must help [students] understand how vital it is to unite around this crisis,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThe COVID-19 health crisis is forcing each of us to make sacrifices and changes none of us wants to make. In the end, however, it is not about us. It\u2019s about our responsibility to our fellow human beings.\u201d","19":"RICHMOND \u2014 In early February \u2014 just a few weeks after the U.S. confirmed its first case of coronavirus transmission \u2014 it wasn\u2019t a question of when the University of Virginia would develop its own test for the virus. It was a question of whether to do it. \u201cWe were trying to decide whether or not we needed to have an assay here right away,\u201d said Melinda Poulter, director of clinical microbiology in the university\u2019s Department of Pathology. \u201cOr did we want to wait for a commercial option? What were the possibilities?\u201d \u201cAt the time, we were looking at this and saying, \u2018Getting an emergency use authorization is not a trivial matter,\u2019\u201d she continued. \u201cAnd then, of course, all of a sudden, the first case hit in Washington. And everybody went, \u2018You know, we probably oughta get a test.\u2019\u201d Both UVa and Virginia Commonwealth University are now on the front lines of the state\u2019s race to expand its testing capabilities \u2014 a push labs across the country are making as states scramble to quell the spread of the virus. But neither Poulter nor Christopher Doern, the director of microbiology at VCU Medical Center, felt comfortable giving an estimate of when the tests would become available. It\u2019s not for lack of trying. Poulter said she blocked off the entire weekend in preparation for a crucial delivery that would allow her lab to begin running trials. Both institutions are stuck in limbo as they wait for critical supplies \u2014 the same materials that scientists across the country, and around the world, are ordering as the virus continues to spread. In many ways, Virginia is a microcosm for the rest of the country as it works to expand its own testing capabilities. Federal delays, and a shortage of supplies, have hamstrung national efforts to contain the outbreak. Given the ongoing uncertainty, it still isn\u2019t clear when the state will develop the capacity for widespread surveillance, a critical tool in limiting the spread of the virus. Poulter said she just learned Thursday that there\u2019s a nationwide shortage of viral transport media, which is used to stabilize samples en-route for testing. Disruptions in the supply chain also could limit screening, even when both tests are up and running. \u201cIf even one of the components of the test are not available, you can\u2019t do the test,\u201d Doern said. \u201cAnd so whether or not we can do it is somewhat out of our hands. I think we\u2019ve got everything we need in place \u2014 both staff and expertise. It\u2019s just whether or not these things are delivered.\u201d As the number of cases in the state has risen, Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam, a pediatrician, has been increasingly direct about the urgent need for better screening. \u201cWe need more testing capacity immediately,\u201d he posted on Twitter after a Friday meeting at Richmond Community Hospital. \u201cI am absolutely concerned about the limited capacity of testing in Virginia,\u201d he said in a later statement. \u201cAs a doctor, I can tell you that one of the most limiting things is when you are unable to diagnose a patient.\u201d Northam and other officials have said that the current capability at the state\u2019s lab in Richmond \u2014 which, as of Thursday, estimated it could test between 500 and 600 patients \u2014 would meet the needs of Virginians who currently fall under the state\u2019s criteria for testing. But the governor also has acknowledged that the state is purposefully restricting those criteria to reserve tests for the most at-need. This week, he announced that nursing home residents experiencing respiratory symptoms were eligible for testing \u2014 an expansion of current guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Otherwise, the state\u2019s supply is limited to residents with close contact to an infected patient or a history of travel in countries with widespread transmission. \u201cTesting is limited now, so it\u2019s important, from a public health perspective, that we test those who are most at-risk,\u201d state epidemiologist Dr. Lilian Peake told lawmakers in a Thursday briefing with the House of Delegates. \u201cBut we know there are people working around the clock to increase their capabilities.\u201d Like other states, testing delays in Virginia can be traced back to federal missteps at the beginning of the U.S. outbreak. The CDC spent weeks developing its own test, which \u2014 in many cases \u2014 didn\u2019t work correctly after it was distributed across the country in early February. For several weeks, the state had to send samples to the agency\u2019s headquarters in Atlanta for testing. In early March, the state lab was cleared to screen samples on its own, but still depends on the CDC for testing supplies. Experts have described the U.S. response to COVID-19 as a fiasco, largely driven by the lack of extensive screening. Academic labs, in the absence of federal leadership, began developing their own tests, driving up the demand for supplies quickly and all at once. \u201cAt that point in time, we went through the same thing that every other major academic lab was going through,\u201d Poulter said. \u201cAnd immediately, resources just fell.\u201d Her lab is currently waiting on a sample of the virus itself, a critical tool in confirming the accuracy of the test. Doern\u2019s lab at VCU is still waiting on one particular instrument \u2014 a machine used to rapidly detect the presence of RNA from COVID-19. Any lab using the CDC\u2019s methods for diagnosing the virus is required to use the same device, Doern said. And the vast majority of labs are choosing to use the CDC\u2019s methods because alternative techniques require an extra layer of approval from the federal Food and Drug Administration \u2014 another barrier in quickly developing a test. \u201cEveryone around the country and around the world is requesting that instrument,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, it\u2019s just a question of when we\u2019re going to get it.\u201d His lab is now hoping for a delivery by the end of the month or even mid-April. Then it\u2019s still a question of developing and verifying a working test. Both UVa and VCU are hoping for the ability to test samples from various parts of the body, including the nasal tract, lower respiratory tract and sputum \u2014 a mixture of saliva and mucus often coughed up by patients with respiratory disease. To verify the accuracy of the test, Poulter said scientists have to make sure it doesn\u2019t react with other organisms commonly found in those areas, including bacteria and non-COVID viruses. \u201cYou have to do that with a lot of different organisms just to make sure you don\u2019t get a false positive,\u201d she said. The same tests have to be run for every type of sample \u2014 and that\u2019s after an initial \u201climit of detection\u201d study to figure out the smallest quantity of virus that can be accurately detected by the test. In other words, it takes time. And right now, both labs are still waiting on critical materials to assemble their tests. On Friday, the Trump administration announced measures to speed up the availability of testing \u2014 including a hotline for supplies \u2014 but it\u2019s still unclear how effective the new steps will be. In the meantime, COVID-19 is spreading. Dr. Gonzalo Bearman, chief of infectious diseases and director of infection prevention at the VCU School of Medicine, told The Virginia Mercury on Wednesday that it is \u201cessentially inevitable\u201d that community transmission will occur here, if it isn\u2019t already happening. Without wider testing, experts say it\u2019s impossible to truly monitor the spread of the virus. In an ideal world, Virginia would begin screening every patient who presented symptoms in order to minimize further transmission, confirmed Dr. William Petri, an infectious disease specialist at UVa, in an email on Friday. \u201cTesting allows us to identify who is infected so that we can isolate them,\u201d he wrote, \u201cand then go on to identify their contacts and quarantine them, with the ultimate goal of stopping the spread of infection.\u201d","20":"Charlottesville and Albemarle County are reevaluating their public meetings, canceling some and moving several online amid coronavirus concerns. No cases of the virus have been reported in either the city or county, according to data available Saturday evening from the Virginia Department of Health.\u00a0 Following recommendations from the Thomas Jefferson Health District that gatherings of more than 100 people be avoided to limit spread of the virus, the city announced that it has canceled all but one of its public meetings of boards and commissions for the foreseeable future. For the sole holdout\u00a0\u2014 Monday\u2019s City Council meeting\u00a0\u2014\u00a0officials are discouraging the public from attending in-person, instead offering alternative means of participation. The options are split between \u201cview only\u201d and a pilot \u201cview and participate\u201d option, with the former category spotlighting the already-in-use options of viewing the meets via Comcast Cable TC Channel 10, a livestream on the city\u2019s website and a live broadcast via Facebook. Those who wish to view and participate will be able to do so via an online webinar available on internet-connected devices. According to a city news release, the council and the public will be able to see and hear community members who wish to be recognized during community matters and during public hearings on the budget and real estate tax rate. A link to the webinar and access instructions will be shared Monday afternoon on the city's website, charlottesville.org, and social media platforms. No special advance sign-ups will be required for online participation in the public hearings. People who wish to participate in the community matters portion should sign up as normal. If someone who is signed up for community matters is participating via webinar, they will be connected to the meeting to speak. Similarly, Albemarle County has revised its meeting and events schedule, canceling many but proceeding with all gatherings expected to draw fewer than 100. According to a news release from the county, public meetings, events and recreation programs expected to have more than 100 attendees are being individually evaluated for how to proceed. Wednesday's Board of Supervisors work session has been moved to Lane Auditorium in the County Office Building from a smaller room to accommodate social distancing recommendations. Virtual participation also will be supported through the county\u2019s website, albemarle.org, which will have a link to live video-streaming and a way to submit questions to be answered live at the meeting. Town hall meetings for the Scottsville and White Hall districts will be held virtually, as will the Court Square Community Conversations event scheduled for Friday. A Board of Supervisors town hall scheduled for Thursday has been cancelled.","21":"The diagnosis marks the first case of COVID-19, the illness caused by the novel coronavirus, in the district, according to a news release. The positive case is a woman in her late 50s and the case appears to be travel-related, news releases said. The patient was tested for the novel coronavirus by a commercial lab. There are at least 51 positive cases in Virginia, according to the Virginia Department of Health, but the department\u2019s Monday update did not including the Charlottesville case. According to the health district and the University of Virginia, the person is a member of the Women\u2019s Center staff who lives off-Grounds. She is receiving treatment and has been quarantined at her home, according to an email sent to the UVa community by school President Jim Ryan. The Women\u2019s Center is being vacated and deep-cleaned with products that kill the coronavirus in accordance with CDC guidelines, the email from Ryan said. All 17 of the center\u2019s permanent, non-student staff are currently self-quarantining, according to a university spokesman. \u201cThe situation with COVID-19 outbreak is rapidly changing, so it is not surprising that we are identifying a case in our area,\u201d Dr. Denise Bonds, director of the Thomas Jefferson Health District, said in the release. \u201cPublic health officials will work to isolate the patient and to investigate all people who had close contact with the patient. Contacts will be asked to stay home away from others for 14 days.\u201d According to the release, most patients with COVID-19 have mild to moderate symptoms. However, in a small proportion of patients, COVID-19 can lead to more severe illness, including death, particularly among those who are older or who have chronic medical conditions. Symptoms include fever, cough and difficulty breathing. Symptoms appear within 14 days of being exposed to an infectious person. COVID-19 spreads primarily through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes, the release said. To prevent the spread of COVID-19, people should stay home as much as possible. The Thomas Jefferson Health District has activated a public information line, (434) 972-6261, for questions from community members about the coronavirus situation. Sentara All routine visiting at Sentara Health facilities, including Martha Jefferson Hospital, is being suspended until the transmission of COVID-19 is no longer a threat, including all outpatient services. Some exceptions are for obstetric patients, Nursery and Neonatal Intensive Care Unit patients, and patients who are at the end-of-life may each have two visitors. Patients where a family member is key to their care or a caregiver provides safety, minors under the age of 18 and patients visiting the Emergency Department may each have one person with them. Visitors age 12 and under are prohibited inside the hospitals. UVa Medical Center UVa has decided to reschedule certain elective surgeries that are scheduled for the next two weeks to save resources and maintain a safe environment for patients, faculty and staff. Patients are encouraged to call the clinic directly or call (434) 924-0000. City, Albemarle updates Following Monday\u2019s presumptive positive test, Charlottesville announced via a news release that starting Tuesday it will begin operating with only essential employees. This staffing plan will be in effect for at least the next two weeks and will be reevaluated on March 29, according to the release. The release encourages the public to use all available online and telephonic options for conducting business at City Hall, including using payment drop boxes on both sides of City Hall and the drive-thru drop box located between the City Hall Annex and the Key Recreation Center. The Neighborhood Development Services team will be accessible to the public needing to conduct essential business with that department through the Market Street entrance only, according to the release. Two meetings of the Albemarle County Board of Supervisors, scheduled for Tuesday and Wednesday, will continue, though the public is encouraged to participate virtually. Public comments can be sent through email to bos@albemarle.org and will be distributed to the entire Board of Supervisors. The meetings will be held in Lane Auditorium and limited to a capacity of 50 people. Crowd management will be utilized if more than 50 people attend and those in the auditorium are encouraged to utilize hand sanitizing stations and to distance themselves from one another.","22":"As Virginia faces a shortage of respirator masks, the University of Virginia Medical Center has recommended its staff use ear-loop masks to in order to conserve respirators. Respirators can filter small particles from the air, according to the Centers for Disease Control, while simpler ear-loop masks protect against droplets, splashes and larger particles. In an email sent Sunday, the hospital reiterated a requirement that staff use personal protection equipment, specifically gowns, gloves, eye protection and an ear-loop mask. The use of ear-loop masks is a change from earlier Centers of Disease Control and Prevention guidelines, which encouraged the use of respirators \u2014 such as an N95 mask \u2014 instead of simpler face masks, in order to prevent contraction of the novel coronavirus. Surgical masks \u2014 which do not filter contaminants and are designed to prevent the wearer from infecting sterile environments \u2014 were labeled an \u201cacceptable alternative\u201d in the absence of respirators by the CDC. Eric Swensen, a spokesman for the hospital, wrote in an email to the Progress that respirators are being conserved for use during the care of elderly patients and for procedures that may generate aerosol, which pose the highest exposure risk to staff. \u201cTogether with hand hygiene, eye protection, gowns and gloves, face masks only replace respirators for routine care, where large respiratory droplets (for example, due to coughing) can expose the mouths, noses and eyes of persons in close (less than 6 feet) proximity to persons infected with COVID-19,\u201d Swensen wrote. Swensen also cited a 2019 study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association that indicated facemasks are equally as effective as respirators in preventing the spread of viral respiratory diseases. A March 2020 study also cited by Swensen and published in the Journal did not find the virus that causes COVID-19 in air samples of hospital rooms of patients with the virus but did find the virus on surfaces in the room before room cleaning. Both studies were considered by UVa when it made its PPE recommendations, Swensen said. UVa\u2019s recommendations also follow an estimated $2.7 million order of respirator masks made by the state last week as part of its ongoing effort to respond to the growing spread of COVID-19, according to Virginia Mercury. However, the state isn\u2019t sure when the shipment will arrive. According to the Mercury, Virginia was one of dozens of states to place an order for the masks as the country scrambles to respond to the spreading viral outbreak. The federal government has sent the state tens of thousands of respirators, gowns, gloves and other protective gear for health care providers, according to the The Associated Press, but it\u2019s not enough, and it\u2019s still not entirely clear what should be best practice for a disease experts are still trying to figure out. Recent evidence suggests that transmission is linked to close contact with infected patients \u2014 the first known person-to-person transmission of COVID-19 in the U.S. was a woman who spread the disease to her husband after returning from travel in Wuhan, China. \u201cViral droplets\u201d from infected patients are also a concern, and health workers who come in contact with patients have been advised to wear N95 respirator masks. The federal Food and Drug Administration has already issued guidelines to health care providers with strategies for conserving their supply. Virginia Health Commissioner Dr. M. Norman Oliver said last week that the state of emergency declared by Gov. Ralph Northam would also allow the state to bypass federal restrictions on equipment, such as respirators, for medical providers. Charlottesville has one confirmed case of the novel coronavirus; the woman is being quarantined at home, local officials said Monday. On Tuesday, state officials said there were 67 confirmed cases in the state.","23":"Amelia Faison, a second-year at the University of Virginia, stood in her dorm room Tuesday, unsure of where to start. Under normal circumstances, she would have slowly packed up her belongings. Instead, she had less than an hour to get what she needed and had to leave larger items behind. She drove back home to Charlotte, North Carolina on Tuesday, carpooling with Jack Thomson, a first-year who lives in Atlanta. \u201cI was pretty bummed,\u201d Thomson said of packing up and leaving. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m much happier at UVa. I really fell in love with the school. I was pretty sad this morning.\u201d UVa students living on Grounds must move out by noon Wednesday after finding out last week that in-person classes on Grounds were suspended and switching to online. UVa is one of scores of universities to take similar steps in the face of the global novel coronavirus pandemic. Federal and state officials are taking drastic steps to limit large gatherings of people, but universities were the first group to take significant steps to slow the spread of COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. As of Tuesday, the number of national cases of COVID-19 surpassed 5,000, and Virginia now has 67 confirmed cases. UVa still remains open to staff, but only students who have unavoidable circumstances are now allowed to live in campus housing, and they must notify the university before the deadline in order to retain access their dorm. Sydney Macon, a third-year physics major, was a resident advisor in a dorm. She said she had to say goodbye to friends and residents very suddenly before returning home to Maryland, and wasn\u2019t able to say goodbye to some at all. \u201cI was able to get everything, but most of it I had to do on my own as my parents couldn\u2019t take off work abruptly to spend a whole day in Charlottesville moving me out,\u201d she said. Online classes are set to begin Thursday, but students said they aren\u2019t sure how those classes will work. Macon said some teachers have sent thoughtful messages, but that it\u2019s stressful to not know how long students will be gone or when they might return to normalcy. \u201cUVa keeps saying the same thing in different ways, and beyond President Ryan\u2019s sentiments, teachers are just easy to get back to work and no one has acknowledged how taxing this is, which is super frustrating,\u201d she said. UVa Housing and Residence Life didn\u2019t have an exact tally of students who are staying by press time Tuesday. University officials also have asked parents to get their students out of Charlottesville, but have little power to enforce that push. On Tuesday, several residents of University Circle sent an email to university officials complaining about parties occurring at fraternity houses on Rugby Road and Grady Avenue. \u201cThey are a risk to our vulnerable neighbors and are here in flagrant disregard for your instructions,\u201d Karen Marsh wrote in an email asking university officials to take stronger action against the organizations, which are independent of the university. Dean of Students Allen Groves responded that he was asking university police to patrol the area more frequently and to be on the lookout for open containers and other violations. In a phone call later, Groves said he and staff had communicated with the student body and with local fraternity and sorority organizations and their alumni affiliates in order to impress the severity of the situation. \u201cWe\u2019ve tried to tell them in no uncertain terms that this is brutally serious stuff,\u201d Groves said. \u201cIf you do the right thing here, this could save a life. Groves said that on Tuesday afternoon, as several reports of student parties trickled in, he sent staff and jumped in the car himself to check on students and ask them to turn in, or, if organizations continue to flout state and local requests, to potentially face conduct violations. As on-campus residents clear out, Faison said the message from professors has been that they\u2019ll try online instruction methods out and see how it works, troubleshooting along the way. \u201cA lot are being helpful and making sure we understand they are open to any questions,\u201d said Faison, a pre-communications major. Thomson is studying mechanical engineering. \u201cI could see doing a computer science lecture online, but I don\u2019t know how a physics lab would work,\u201d he said. Thomson added that he might be able to use this time to get his grades up a little. UVa President Jim Ryan empathized with students in a social media post Sunday evening, acknowledging that they are losing something will be difficult to recover. \u201cThis is especially true of our graduating students, but it also true for hundreds of student-athletes, student performers of all sorts, student-researchers, and others who were preparing for something, participating in something, pouring their hearts into something that will now not happen,\u201d he wrote. \u201cNo matter how much we know that this is the right thing to do, that we will work through this, and that will we will emerge even stronger than we are \u2014 this is a loss. A real one, and in many cases a painful one.\u201d","24":"State officials said Tuesday that they are working to determine how to increase capacity in hospitals throughout Virginia to prepare for the potential surge of patients as a result of COVID-19, but they wouldn\u2019t say exactly how many ventilators are available in the state. Virginia has about 2.1 hospital beds per 1,000 people, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, compared with 2.8 nationally and 3.2 in Italy \u2014 where hospitals have been overwhelmed by the virus \u2014 according to data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Simulations conducted by a team of researchers at Harvard Global Health Institute that show various scenarios of how the virus could overwhelm hospitals suggest that without drastic public health measures such as social distancing and hand washing, hospital beds in the Richmond region and much of the U.S. will quickly reach and exceed capacity, ProPublica reported. \u201cWe are working \u2026 to understand exactly how many beds we can push into service,\u201d said State Secretary of Health and Human Services Daniel Carey, at a press conference Tuesday. Carey told a reporter at the Tuesday press conference that his team would release the number of ventilators in the state, but the Virginia Department of Health and the Virginia Hospital and Healthcare Association would not give a specific number. \u201cVirginia hospitals and health systems have ventilator equipment on-hand to accommodate the treatment needs of patients experiencing respiratory issues,\u201d the state health department said in a statement. \u201cIn addition to on-site equipment, the regional coalitions that [comprise] the Virginia Healthcare Emergency Management Program (VHEMP) have hundreds of ventilators in reserve across the Commonwealth that can be deployed to hospitals when needed. Depending on the situation, other ventilator equipment could be deployed from the strategic national stockpile in that event that is warranted.\u201d President Donald Trump on Monday told governors that states should try to obtain ventilators and other medical supplies themselves rather than wait for the federal government to provide them. In Italy, where hospitals didn\u2019t have enough ventilators, doctors began rationing them, prioritizing younger people and leaving the elderly \u2014 who are more vulnerable to the virus \u2014 without treatment, according to news reports. Carey said that most hospitals do not operate all of their beds on a regular basis, and that the state is working with hospitals to expand bed capacity, including by converting operating rooms into patient care rooms and by granting waivers so that hospitals can operate beds that are not licensed by state regulators. He added that the state is looking into bringing in the National Guard for help if necessary. \u201cTreating patients is our most important priority,\u201d Carey said. State Health Commissioner Norman Oliver said that, while many cases of the disease are reportedly mild, our understanding of the disease and its potential burden on the state health system is still limited. Oliver pointed to a report backed by the World Health Organization that claims that COVID-19 results in mild to moderate illness for 80% of people who contract it. \u201cThat statistic comes from looking at the pandemic in China. Everything that was listed as mild was anything other than the severe disease. Included in the mild category is some pretty bad pneumonia,\u201d Oliver said. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to think you\u2019re just going to get a cold. This is a serious, serious pandemic.\u201d Virginia has 18,547 licensed hospital beds, but hospitals only have staff to serve 16,914, according to Julian Walker, spokesman for the Virginia Hospital and Healthcare Association. Of those, 1,967 licensed beds and 1,762 staffed beds are Intensive Care Unit beds \u2014 which is the type of bed that someone with a severe case of COVID-19 would likely need. Walker said that Virginia hospitals have planned for what are known as \u201cmedical surges\u201d \u2014 when there is a higher than normal influx of patients. The Harvard simulation found that, in a moderate scenario where 40% of the population is infected over a 12-month period, Richmond area hospitals would require more than double the number of current available beds, according to ProPublica\u2019s report. The simulation also found that Richmond\u2019s ICUs would be particularly overwhelmed, needing more than five times the current average open capacity. Many hospitals, particularly academic medical centers like VCU Medical Center and UVA Medical Center, are already operating at or near capacity, said Dr. Taison Bell, an assistant professor of medicine in the divisions of Infectious Diseases and International Health and Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine at UVA. \u201cThe concern is that you\u2019re already adding on top of a constrained health system,\u201d Bell said. To prepare for the surge, some hospital systems have begun rescheduling elective surgeries to free up capacity for possible COVID-19 patients. Bell said that hospital systems are also bracing for staffing and equipment shortages as they take on COVID-19 patients in addition to the other patients they have to see. for car accidents and emergency and serious health issues. Health care providers have been shown to be at risk of becoming ill from the coronanvirus in China, Italy and in the U.S. where the outbreak has unfolded, Bell said. He said that it was crucial for people to practice public health measures, particularly social distancing and staying home when sick, in order to keep hospital systems from becoming overwhelmed. \u201cThose are the things that kind of blunt the rise,\u201d Bell said, explaining that limiting the number of people exposed to the virus can keep the number of people needing hospitalization within the capabilities of hospitals. \u201cIf we can smooth out the curve, we\u2019ll have the ability to take care of every patient.\u201d","25":"Update 3\/18: On Wednesday, UVa President Jim Ryan clarified that while Final Exercises are canceled \"as currently planned,\" the university is still exploring alternatives in order to give students a graduation, including holding ceremonies at a later date. The University of Virginia on Tuesday announced that it will cancel Final Exercises in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Classes will move online for the rest of the semester, and all events on Grounds, regardless of size, are canceled through May 15, UVa President Jim Ryan announced in a Tuesday evening letter to the university community. Ryan said the decisions were made based on evidence that the novel coronavirus will not have abated by late April. The university had initially hoped to put a brief pause on in-person teaching and operations. \u201cIn light of the evidence about the likely progression of the virus over the next couple of months, and when it will peak, we have made the difficult decision to cancel Final Exercises as currently planned,\u201d Ryan wrote. \u201cWe do not make this decision lightly, as we know how disappointing it will be to graduating students and their families.\u201d The university will continue to pay full-time and part-time employees through the shut down, the letter said. Employees who can work from home will be told to do so, the letter said, and those whose jobs are in-person must still show up for work. The rest may be asked to pick up other duties, the letter said, but they will be paid either way. The two-day Final Exercises ceremony, a staple early-summer event that draws thousands, was scheduled for May 16 and 17. UVa staff are working on an alternative to the Lawn celebration, the letter said. Ryan said he will provide clarity on the status of research at the university Wednesday. UVa is committed to research, the letter said, but is seeking steps to keep its workers safe. Students with federal work study jobs will be paid an average of their bi-weekly pay through the end of the semester, if they cannot work remotely. Work study students who can work remotely will be allowed to do so with the approval of their supervisor, Ryan said. Teaching assistants and students assisting with research will continue to be paid if they are able to work remotely. Student employees who cannot work remotely and are not in the work study program will not be retained, the letter said. \u201cFor the safety of students and the others with whom they may come into contact, non-FWS student employees who cannot work remotely will not be eligible to continue working while the University\u2019s operating schedule is modified due to COVID-19,\u201d Ryan wrote. Dining services that do not support UVa Health will be restricted to the O-Hill dining hall, and will be served as take out or grab-and-go, the letter said. Only students with no other housing option, such as international students who cannot return home, will be allowed to remain in university housing after noon on Wednesday. Many students are already moving out. \u201cImplementing these changes will no doubt be difficult, and we know further questions will arise, but we remain as confident as ever in our community\u2019s ability to navigate this unprecedented set of challenges together,\u201d Ryan wrote. \u201cIn the meantime, our profound thanks to everyone in this community for your dedication, creativity, and compassion.\u201d","26":null,"27":"The University of Virginia\u2019s decision to cancel the planned Final Exercises devastated students hoping to celebrate the milestone in front of friends and family and dealt another gut punch to area businesses already reeling from ramifications of the COVID-19 outbreak. President Jim Ryan clarified Wednesday that the university is looking into \u201ccreative alternatives\u201d for the annual ceremonies, which could include holding Final Exercises, which had been scheduled for May 16 and 17, at a later date. \u201cWe know how important this ceremony is to our students and families, and we will do our very best to figure out a good solution,\u201d Ryan wrote. An online petition signed by hundreds of students and community members called on the university to just postpone Final Exercises, in addition to several other demands, such as offering all staff members paid sick leave, offering students who have had to leave campus housing storage options, offering rebates for campus housing, extending academic accommodations and continuing to pay student workers. UVa addressed some demands Tuesday, when it said work-study students would continue to be paid and unused dining fees could be rebated, but students on Wednesday requested further accommodations. \u201cWalking across the Lawn for Final Exercises at the end of one\u2019s UVa career is an experience that can simply not be emulated,\u201d students wrote, though they said they understand the ceremonies should not occur during the pandemic. \u201cThere is no creative alternative that can mark this momentous day for graduating students in the same capacity.\u201d In previous years, UVa has expected more than 30,000 people for the weekend celebration. Area hotels sell out and restaurants fill up. Elizabeth Cromwell, president of the Charlottesville Regional Chamber of Commerce, said the chamber is prepared to advocate for and connect with business owners to help them recover from this crisis. \u201cWhile we completely understand the university\u2019s reasoning for the cancellation and agree it\u2019s in the best interest for the population\u2019s physical health, the result is nonetheless devastating to the health of our business community,\u201d she said. Courtney Cacatian, executive director of the Charlottesville Albemarle Convention and Visitors Bureau, hopes the university will figure out how to hold graduation later, rather than cancel it entirely. \u201cUVa\u2019s graduation is one of the biggest revenue generating weekends of the year,\u201d she said. \u201cIt sets the tone for how we\u2019ll do over the summer. It affects hotels, stores and other businesses.\u201d Cacatian said that not only do hotels sell out, but they also sell at higher rates. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the most expensive weekends to visit,\u201d she said. The loss of lodging taxes from that weekend would be felt immediately by local governments, Cacatian said. \u201cThere are so many different ways that this one weekend ends up impacting a lot of different business,\u201d she said. The CACVB board of directors is having an emergency meeting at 10 a.m. Monday to discuss the COVID-19 crisis. Students who are still trying to figure out how to transition to online classes \u2014 some without internet and some from different timezones \u2014 say they wish they had more time to grieve the loss of an important milestone. Jesse Walther, a fourth-year psychology student, said she was celebrating St. Patrick\u2019s Day at home with her boyfriend when she got the email from the university notifying her that Final Exercises were canceled. \u201cIt just spun my world upside down,\u201d she said, adding that while she is confident close friends will keep in touch, she\u2019s sad about the loss of new friendships that were just starting to form, and of friends who will likely go overseas and not be able to return for a postponed graduation. Walther also said that she lost one of her on-Grounds jobs due to the shutdown, and now has to work full-time at her other job to pay bills in the midst of figuring out the transition to online. \u201cI am the first in my family to go to college, let alone graduate, and now none of them will be able to witness that, which is crushing,\u201d Walther said, \u201cIf I even still earn my degree with this semester\u2019s transition being so difficult. I am at school on a full-ride scholarship and I\u2019m not someone who can just \u2018take another semester\u2019 to keep up.\u201d On Wednesday evening, University of Virginia Provost Liz Magill announced that undergraduates courses will default to a credit\/no credit, or pass\/fail grading system. Students will have the option to receive a letter grade, Magill said in a release. Credit\/no credit courses will count towards graduation, major and curricular requirements, but will not be factored into a students GPA, according to the release. Students in credit\/no credit grading must earn a C or better average to pass. The change does not affect graduate programs, the release said. A decision by the deans of UVa\u2019s graduate and professional programs will be announced later.","28":"Children should practice social distancing techniques along with adults because most kids who contract COVID-19 have either mild or no symptoms and may spread the virus to older, at-risk relatives, according to a University of Virginia pediatrician and researcher. Dr. Steven L. Zeichner, head of the UVa Health System\u2019s pediatric infectious diseases division, joined Dr. Andrea T. Cruz, of the Baylor College of Medicine, to review case studies of children across the world who tested positive for the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. The case studies, which documented several thousand international cases, including from China and Norway, so far show that school-age children most often don\u2019t display any symptoms or have mild symptoms, meaning they could unwittingly bring the virus home to others who are at risk. Among children who had symptoms, only 5% had trouble breathing, which is much lower than in the infected adult population, and fewer became seriously ill with the disease, the studies showed. \u201cPracticing social distancing with children sort of goes against who we are,\u201d Zeichner said. \u201cIf you go to a park with your child and another comes up to play, it\u2019s natural to want to interact, but you have to be diligent about social distancing, even with children. You definitely don\u2019t want to send your child to a big birthday party or to be in large groups.\u201d Zeichner and Cruz found that in 13% of confirmed cases, children had no symptoms of the virus infection. They said that means the number of children actually infected with the virus was probably much higher because others who were asymptomatic likely were never tested. In children, the virus may mimic the common cold or other childhood ailments and may not be diagnosed as COVID-19. \u201cChildren get colds all of the time, and most of the time we just write it off and we don\u2019t think much about it,\u201d Zeichner said. \u201cBut some of the kids who just seem to have a cold could have the virus.\u201d Limiting social interactions between children could help curb the spread of the virus. \u201cIf you have children playing together, even if the adults are social distancing, you could have the virus being spread around,\u201d he said. \u201cIf one child has the virus, even if there are no symptoms, the virus can be transmitted to other children who may also be asymptomatic. Then those children go home and spread the virus to their parents and their parents spread it to grandparents. Meanwhile, the siblings receive it and spread it to other children who take it home.\u201d While most healthy children suffer only mild symptoms, that\u2019s not true of very young children and children with lung problems or immune issues, Zeichner said. For them, the virus can be dangerous. \u201cThat\u2019s especially true for children less than a year old and babies because their immune systems are still maturing,\u201d Zeichner said. \u201cChildren older than 1 who are infected showed very minimal or even non-apparent symptoms.\u201d According to Zeichner\u2019s and Cruz\u2019s review, evidence indicates that young children may also shed the virus through bowel movements. That could be problematic in households where small children are being toilet trained and in daycare centers. \u201cIt is important to practice all the social distancing, hygiene and other precautions being recommended by public health authorities to minimize transmission from children to others,\u201d Zeichner said. \u201cThe situation is serious. It\u2019s easy to see things happen on TV and think it\u2019s a world away, but one day it seems impossible to believe and the next day you\u2019re in Milan and everyone around you is going to the hospital,\u201d he said. Zeichner is currently researching ways to create a vaccine in his UVa laboratory. He said many others across the country are doing similar work. \u201cThe reality of research is that a great majority of what you do ends up not being important, but when you combine it with what others are doing, it can make a big difference,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have a lot of people who have totally stopped what they were doing and started researching what we can do to respond to the virus. Everybody who has the capability is rethinking and reworking their efforts to resolve this.\u201d","29":"The Charlottesville area had three new cases of COVID-19 reported to the Thomas Jefferson Health District on Thursday, bringing total area cases to four. Health district officials said two of the new cases are in Charlottesville and the other is in Albemarle County. The Albemarle case appears to be a University of Virginia student, according to a note the university put on its website Thursday night. The university says a health department followup is underway. The first local confirmed case of COVID-19, the illness caused by the novel coronavirus, was announced Monday. That case is of a woman in her late 50s who works at the UVa\u2019s Women\u2019s Center. UVa also said that an employee of the Biocomplexity Institute in Arlington has tested positive. It is not clear if that person had interacted with people in the Charlottesville area recently. Health district officials say they expect more cases to be discovered as the number of people tested for the virus increases. They indicated they would post new cases on the district website rather than issue statements when each case is confirmed. \u201cWe anticipate that there will be more and suggest people visit [vdh.virginia.gov] for the latest numbers,\u201d said Kathryn Goodman, a spokeswoman for the district, which is part of the Virginia Department of Health. \u201cThe website is updated around noon every day.\u201d The state\u2019s most recent numbers show 94 confirmed cases, but did not include the three new local cases. UVa Health System officials say they are now conducting their own COVID-19 tests. \u201cWe have started performing local tests in a limited capacity, about 20 per day right now, with the hopes of increasing to around 80 per day by this weekend,\u201d said Eric Swensen, UVa Health System spokesman. \u201cOne factor that will limit our capacity for testing is a national shortage of the nasal and upper throat swabs needed to perform the test.\u201d Swensen said the local testing is being conducted based on criteria set by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the state health department. \u201cOur clinicians have the discretion to request testing based on their review of an individual patient\u2019s situation,\u201d he said. \u201cIn general, testing is based on factors that include a patient\u2019s symptoms, potential exposure to others with COVID-19 and recent travel history. Any positive test would be reported to the [health department].\u201d Two men from Richmond who attended the March 5 grand opening of the Quirk Hotel Charlottesville tested positive for COVID-19. The pair also had traveled to New York and Philadelphia for work and attended various social events prior to the call for social distancing. Quirk employees said the hotel has continued sanitation measures that began after the opening and prior to the pair testing positive. Goodman said the health department has reached out to those who attended the event and may have come in contact with the pair. As the number of virus cases increases \u2014 national officials said Thursday that a ramp-up in testing availability will now allow labs to work through a backlog of tests, likely leading to many more confirmed cases \u2014 UVa said it plans to increase the number of beds for virus patients. \u201cWe have developed multiple scenarios for providing care if we were to see an influx of patients that required hospitalization for coronavirus,\u201d Swensen said. \u201cWe are also readying an inpatient unit in our newly constructed hospital expansion building to provide care, if needed.\u201d UVa also has rescheduled certain surgeries and clinic visits to accommodate virus patients. \u201cWe\u2019ve taken multiple steps this week that will help expand our capacity,\u201d Swensen said. \u201cThey include rescheduling most elective surgeries over the next two weeks, as well as rescheduling most outpatient clinic visits, with the exception of urgent care and sick care visits, that were scheduled between now and April 6.\u201d UVa also is partnering with the virtual health care company Teladoc to help employees answer questions about COVID-19, evaluate risk and determine if additional testing or treatment is needed. The service is free to UVa health plan participants and employees through June 4. Local governments and organizations also made several changes Thursday to accommodate social distancing needed to keep the virus contained. Local taxes Albemarle County extended the deadline to apply for the real property tax exemption for elderly and disabled persons from April 1 to May 16. More information on qualifications and how to apply can be found at albemarle.org\/finance under the real estate tax relief programs tab. Charlottesville\u2019s treasury office has suspended all collections for past-due taxes and fees, the city announced Thursday. Taxpayers who received a personal property tax supplement originally due on April 3 now will have a due date of April 17. The assessment of past-due penalty and interest on all local taxes has been suspended until May 31. Businesses responsible for remitting meals and lodging tax are encouraged to file timely returns and set up appropriate payment arrangements with the city. During the duration of City Hall\u2019s closure to the public, taxpayers are encouraged to use alternative means of communication with the city, such as drop boxes, online payments and email and phone communication, the city said. Meals on Wheels Meals on Wheels of Charlottesville\/Albemarle announced its last regular delivery will be March 23 and will consist of one hot meal and one cold meal for March 24. On March 24, Meals on Wheels will be closed, but workers will package two weeks\u2019 worth of shelf-stable food into reusable bags to give to each meal recipient. The shelf-stable bags of food will be delivered to all of their current meal recipients on March 25. The organization then will be closed until at least April 8. Meals on Wheels said it will announce a plan by April 6 for the following two weeks.

Ralph Northam to address a growing supply crisis amid the coronavirus pandemic. The petition, started Saturday by Charlottesville pediatrician Dr. Paige Perriello, had more than 300 signatures by Saturday evening and was growing by the minute. The most signatures were from Charlottesville health care workers, with nearly 200. Twelve workers in Albemarle County, four in Culpeper, two in Nelson and one in Greene had also signed by press time Saturday evening. Perriello, who works at Pediatric Associates of Charlottesville, said that many of her colleagues \u201cfeel scared\u201d about a possible shortage in vital equipment. \u201cEverybody feels worried that they\u2019re not going to have enough stuff or not have the right level of stuff so it feels like quite a pressing issue,\u201d she said. The petition focuses on personal protective equipment, such as face masks and hand sanitizer. \u201cMedical professionals are risking our lives on the front lines of the COVID-19 crisis,\u201d it read. \u201cWe beg you to use your exceptional powers immediately \u2014 literally TODAY \u2014 to solve the desperate medical supply shortage that is thwarting our efforts to control this pandemic before it reaches the point of no return.\u201d Although officials said Saturday that the state is trying to get more supplies, the petition urges Northam to take further action. As the virus spread across the country last week, people flooded stores, buying up toilet paper, face masks and other supplies. The rush has made it difficult for hospitals and medical employees to find necessary equipment. For example, a community health center in Minnesota is considering shutting down because it doesn\u2019t have enough face masks, doctors in St. Louis are performing procedures with loose-fitting masks and expired equipment is all that is available in some Los Angeles emergency rooms, according to The New York Times. On Thursday, President Donald Trump said that millions of supplies were in production after he said he would use the Defense Production Act to marshal resources, but that states would be largely in charge of addressing the shortfall. The petition asks the governor to funnel supplies currently are sitting unused in closed schools, labs and businesses to hospitals; incentivize solutions; and establish clear communication lines between medical professionals and the Virginia Department of Health. \u201cGiven the outbreak\u2019s rapid spread, each day that you wait to establish an emergency supply protocol means more medical providers will fall ill, which threatens the catastrophic collapse of our entire healthcare system,\u201d the petition states. Perriello said that local residents have come up with innovative ideas: Local sewers are making fabric face masks and distilleries are creating hand sanitizer. Pediatric Associates has put a call out for DIY masks, and Perriello said her team is working with several local aid groups to coordinate donations, with information for volunteers forthcoming soon. \u201cThose are exactly the kind of things that we think would be wonderful,\u201d she said. But while those efforts are welcome and may ease the burden for professionals treating routine concerns, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said that DIY face masks and bandanas should be considered a \u201clast resort\u201d while treating coronavirus patients. On Saturday, the University of Virginia Health System announced that it is in \u201cimmediate need\u201d of personal protective equipment for health care workers and is asking all university labs to donate any equipment they have. UVa has taken steps to stretch its supplies by canceling procedures and rescheduling clinical visits, and may take more drastic measures to limit visitors and surgeries if necessary. State help is on the way, but may still fall short as other states and localities jockey for resources. Daniel Carey, Virginia\u2019s secretary of Health and Human Services, said Saturday that the state is distributing supplies from the national stockpile but is looking toward industrial suppliers or local manufacturers for more protective equipment for frontline first responders and prisoners, according to the Richmond Times-Dispatch. \u201cWe are pursuing every opportunity, and I think it\u2019s also important to say that this is a national problem,\u201d Carey said. \u201cThis will not be solved without a national solution.\u201d Two new local cases Two new confirmed COVID-19 cases were reported in the area Saturday, bringing the number in the Thomas Jefferson Health District to nine, per local officials. Four are in Albemarle County, three are in Charlottesville and one case each is in Fluvanna and Louisa counties.The district also covers Nelson and Greene counties. Albemarle had a new case reported Saturday and Louisa County had its first case. According to Louisa officials, the person in that locality received positive test results Saturday. The person was tested Thursday and has been quarantined since that time. Reporting by the Virginia Department of Health is lagging behind local sources as the state website only shows one case in both Charlottesville and Albemarle County and doesn\u2019t yet reflect cases in Fluvanna, Louisa or Rockbridge counties or at least two new cases in the Harrisonburg area that were announced on Friday. The state website reports 152 cases and two deaths as of noon Saturday, an increase of 38 cases from Friday. The Times-Dispatch reported Saturday that Virginia now has the ability to perform testing for over 1,000 patients in addition to private laboratories, and that the state is changing testing criteria to give priority to medical staff treating people with the virus. During his daily press briefing Saturday, Northam said the state is changing testing criteria to give priority to medical staff treating people with the virus, according to the Times-Dispatch. Health officials said they\u2019re also focusing on testing those with respiratory illnesses and are relaxing criteria for people residing in nursing homes. Mincer\u2019s closing Another local business decided to close its doors indefinitely on Saturday. Mark Mincer, the owner of Mincer\u2019s, announced that the UVa sportswear store would close indefinitely starting Saturday at 6 p.m. \u201cWe tried to hang on for a while so the employees would still have some hours, but it is no longer wise or safe,\u201d Mincer wrote on Twitter. Mincer could only remember a few times the store had been closed since opening in 1948. He said it closed for his mother\u2019s funeral in 1993, his grandfather\u2019s funeral in 1996 and his father\u2019s funeral in 2012. Mincer\u2019s website will remain open and orders will still be shipped.","31":"COVID-19 is literally changing the way the world operates. The business impacts of the virus are becoming evident, but the local economic ripple effect of lower tax revenue is yet to be seen. While the full economic impact of COVID-19 is unknowable at this time, an examination of local economic conditions prior to the self-quarantine may provide a glimpse of the challenges ahead. The state collects and distributes the local option 1% sales and use tax. Actual distributions are made to every county and city based on the locality in which the tax was collected. In 2019, this local option sales tax totaled over $18 million for Albemarle County and over $12 million for the City of Charlottesville. The transient occupancy tax is a trust tax imposed on the occupancy of all rooms or spaces offered as guest rooms and rented out for continuous occupancy for fewer than 30 consecutive days. Of the tax collected, 60% goes to the promotion of tourism activities and 40% goes to the locality\u2019s general fund. While we will not learn the March TOT collections until the third week in April, The Free Enterprise Forum has learned that local hotel occupancy is very low and we are starting to see layoffs. In Fiscal Year 2019, Charlottesville received over $5 million in TOT. The Charlottesville Albemarle Convention and Visitors Bureau is maintaining a list of major hotel-room-generating events that have been rescheduled or cancelled: In addition to the University of Virginia cancelling final exercises, the following Charlottesville and Albemarle events have been cancelled or postponed, according to the CACVB: \u00bb The 26th Annual Virginia Festival of the Book has been cancelled. \u00bb Tom Tom Summit & Festival has been rescheduled for Sept. 21-27. Ticket sales are postponed. \u00bb The public dedication for UVa\u2019s Memorial to Enslaved Laborers has been postponed. \u00bb The Charlottesville Ten Miler has been cancelled. \u00bb All Paramount Theater events for March have been cancelled or postponed. \u00bb Most Jefferson Theater events for March have been postponed. \u00bb James Monroe\u2019s Highland will remain closed at least until April 3. \u00bb Thomas Jefferson\u2019s Monticello will remain closed at least until March 30. On March 17, Gov. Ralph Northam issued an executive order reducing restaurant in-house capacity to 10 patrons. The order suggested that restaurants offer take-out services. Several local restaurants are offering this service, but others have opted to close, putting their employees out of work. It should be anticipated that the anticipated meals tax revenue will be drastically reduced. In FY19, Charlottesville generated over $11 million in meals tax. Every year, local governments request commercial property owners to fill out and return an income and expense form. This form is submitted to the board of assessors and is used to determine the value of the property in question. In FY19, Albemarle County collected more than $32 million in taxes on commercial real estate (including apartments). Our discussions with landlords over the past few days have indicated they are preparing for rental revenue to drop precipitously and collection expenses to increase. Based on these factors, The Free Enterprise Forum anticipates a drop in the valuation of commercial real estate in the next round of assessments. The resulting tax revenue reduction will be first felt in FY22 and beyond. Most businesses are being negatively impacted by the new normal instituted by the COVID-19 outbreak. Local governments, which are now in their FY21 budget cycle, would be wise to re-examine their revenue projections and adjust their spending plans accordingly.","32":"As the Charlottesville area saw another case of coronavirus, the University of Virginia Medical Center prohibited visitors to inpatient units starting at 10 p.m. Sunday and increased its restrictions on visitors to outpatient facilities. The Charlottesville area had 10 confirmed cases of COVID-19, which is caused by the coronavirus, as of Sunday evening, according to the Thomas Jefferson Health District. The UVa Health System said that unit managers are allowed to make exceptions on the new restrictions for specific patients if the visitor has no symptoms. Exceptions include patients at the end of life, mothers in labor and pediatric patients. The new restrictions on outpatient areas allow only one designated visitor for the duration of a patient\u2019s stay. The increased restrictions come on the heels of regulations announced on Saturday that require screenings for all who enter facilities and for clinic visits through April 6 to be rescheduled. Local medical professionals have collaborated with SupportCville to coordinate donations of critical supplies amid the pandemic. Equip Cville was launched Sunday to get residents in touch with professionals to donate supplies, particularly protective equipment, such as face masks and hand sanitizer. On Saturday, hundreds of medical professionals signed on to a petition started by Charlottesville pediatrician Dr. Paige Perriello urging Gov. Ralph Northam to address the supply crisis. SupportCville is a collaboration between WillowTree, a Charlotesville app developer, and local activists to create a centralized site that coordinates efforts to help the community during the pandemic. To contact the health professionals, visit tinyurl.com\/equipcville. The petition asks the governor to funnel supplies currently sitting unused in closed schools, labs and businesses to hospitals; incentivize solutions; and establish clear communication lines between medical professionals and the Virginia Department of Health. On Sunday, Northam said the Virginia Department of Emergency Management has shipped a major supply to emergency medical services, health districts and hospitals across the state. He also called on private companies to do more to help with supplies of gloves, gowns, masks and respirators, according to the Richmond Times-Dispatch. BeHeardCVA survey coming The University of Virginia\u2019s Center for Survey Research is recruiting residents in Central Virginia to join its standing survey pool ahead of a planned survey on the virus. BeHeardCVA is drafting a survey that will focus on how information has been shared and how the virus has affected everyday life. Jane Foy, community ambassador for BeHeardCVA, said the survey should be available by the end of next week. \u201cThis might be one of the most important surveys that we do,\u201d she said. BeHeardCVA participants are part of a standing pool of residents of Charlottesville and the counties of Albemarle, Fluvanna, Louisa, Nelson and Greene who have agreed to be contacted about surveys. The effort, led by the Weldon Cooper Center for Public Service at UVa, aims to more easily and affordably conduct representative surveys. Foy said it takes about five minutes to sign up for free on the website. Respondents will not be identified by name in the results. Those who want to participate can choose how they will be notified that the survey is live. Foy said it will stay public for a few weeks. The survey also will be available over the phone in Spanish. To participate, visit beheardcva.org. Local cases The Charlottesville area had at least one new case of the virus reported on Sunday, with a second reported in Louisa County. The case brings the local number of cases to 10, according to the Thomas Jefferson Health District. The Virginia Department of Health reported 219 cases in the state on Sunday, with the 67 new confirmed cases marking the biggest day-to-day increase since the first case was reported earlier this month. The state numbers have been lagging behind local health districts in reporting, but now are showing inconsistencies. VDH reported two cases in Albemarle County, although four were reported locally Sunday. The state also reported four in Charlottesville when local officials reported three.","33":"Citing the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on tourism, the Charlottesville Albemarle Convention and Visitors Bureau has paused its advertising program and moved unspent funding from this year into the next fiscal year\u2019s budget, which begins July 1. The bureau\u2019s board of directors approved the move at an emergency teleconference meeting Monday. Later in the day, the Thomas Jefferson Health District announced 11 local confirmed novel coronavirus cases, an increase of one from Sunday\u2019s official count. The bureau also will keep a contingency of at least $100,000 going into fiscal year 2022, which begins July 2021. \u201cThe purpose for that is that our budget is based on the lodging tax collection two years prior, so this crisis now will impact our budget two years from now,\u201d said Executive Director Courtney Cacatian. A proposed item that would have allowed Cacatian to draft a public message about the importance of tourism was moved to the board\u2019s next meeting. Recreation, services Charlottesville city officials also closed basketball and tennis courts on Monday to go along with playgrounds. Meadowbrook Golf Course and the McIntire Park Skate Park also are closed. The Charlottesville Neighborhood Development Services offices also are now fully closed to the public. City staff will continue to process applications already submitted and will send notices to applicants by email or phone. Some modified inspections will continue but no new development review applications will be accepted, officials said. Applications and fees for building, mechanical, electrical, plumbing and fire permits may be submitted through the U.S. Postal Service. Forms are available online for those permits. Anyone with questions regarding the procedures may call the office during business hours at (434) 970-3182. City residents seeking an annual trash decal will need to fill out an online application and mail the application and payment to P.O., Box 2854, Charlottesville, VA 22902 or drop the payment and application into boxes located between the Charlottesville City Hall Annex and the Key Recreation Center and in Sixth Street alley by City Hall. A decal will be mailed. Also, the city has suspended large item trash collection. City utility employees on Monday began using personal protective gear and practicing social distancing when servicing customers, officials announced. \u201cThe field technician will request that everyone follow [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] best practices for appropriate social distancing,\u201d officials said in a release. \u201cThese measures are not meant to alarm anyone, but are intended as extra precautions to protect the community as well as utilities personnel.\u201d In the statement, officials said callers to the utilities office who are scheduling service appointments will be asked general health questions. \u201cThey can expect brief preliminary questions regarding their current health and potential exposure to the virus,\u201d the statement reads. The State Corporation Commission on Monday certified those utility workers and anyone working in the electric, gas, water and sewer industries as critical employees and the industries as critical to the state. The declaration makes those industries a priority for receiving resources that will prevent service interruptions. It also directs the industries to take additional steps for employee safety. UVa parking, buses University of Virginia officials on Monday lifted parking restrictions at parking meters and lots on Grounds in hopes of improving employee access to workplaces. Restrictions are still in place at the UVa Health parking garages, Scott Stadium, Fontaine Research Park, McCormick Road and the Lawn alleyways. Also on Monday, UVa expanded commuter parking around Scott Stadium to provide parking closer to Grounds and the Medical Center. Blue, Red and Emmet\/Ivy Garage permits will be honored in the expanded parking area, which will be served by a \u201cRedline Special\u201d commuter bus line running from 5 a.m. to 8 p.m. weekdays. The normal red and blue bus service lines will shut down. The changes are in place until April 3, but could be expanded. \u201cThis expansion of Scott Stadium parking and consolidation of the Redline and Blueline will allow us to reduce the number of passengers per trip,\u201d officials said on the UVa parking website. \u201cBus passengers are now instructed to enter and exit through the rear doors only. Front-door access will be permitted only for passengers needing the boarding ramp or operator assistance to access the bus.\u201d According to the website, there will be two bus stops in the parking area but Redline bus stops on Stadium Road and on Alderman Road will not be served.","34":"In less than two months, the novel coronavirus has gone from a distant worry for Virginians to a full-blown crisis.\u00a0 On Jan. 31, Virginia Department of Health officials were investigating two possible cases in the commonwealth. As of Tuesday afternoon, Virginia now has 290 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and seven people around the state have succumbed to the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. Locally, the Thomas Jefferson Health District has reported 16 cases between Charlottesville and Albemarle, Greene Louisa and Fluvanna counties. Globally, there are over 415,000 cases and more than 18,000 people have died from the disease.\u00a0 We are early in the lifespan of the pandemic by most accounts, but already the crisis has felt like a lifetime. No matter how the situation evolves, The Daily Progress will be there for our readers at every turn. With the help of our sister publications across the state, The Daily Progress has for weeks been bringing our audience up-to-the-minute, reliable and thorough coverage on the outbreak and its far-reaching ramifications. When the coronavirus was still thought of as an issue outside of Virginia's borders, we wrote about the creation of a website designed by a University of Virginia undergraduate and his friends. As the first cases were confirmed in the state at the beginning of March, we covered the University of Virginia's initial response to the outbreak, as well as local school divisions' contingency plans. Then, we wrote about how local schools and UVa made the hard decision to close their doors to in-person learning. We were there when\u00a0UVa announced the creation of their own test for COVID-19,\u00a0and we went in-depth about how the\u00a0test was created in a short period of time. Our reporters may not be able to be out and about town as much, but they're committed to holding government accountable in this unprecedented time, describing how neighbors are helping each other and keeping you informed. As local governments, agencies, businesses, restaurants, artists and organizations shut down, altered operations and swung into action, we have offered timely updates about how to navigate a new reality in Central Virginia. Our photo team may not be able to be out and about as much, but they're determined to continue offering a window into life in and around Charlottesville. We've published photo galleries about the pandemic's effects on local businesses, including\u00a0Bodo's Bagels opening its drive-thru lanes for the first time in 32 years. Our sports team may not be able to attend games or press conferences, but they've been on the ball: from the news that the ACC Tournament and the NCAA Championship were canceled, ending some student athletes' tournament dreams, to how residents stay active without organize sports. There will be more stories like those to come, and we will cover each of them with the care and attention to detail our readers expect. The grueling shifts, long hours, endless tips and prolific news cycle show no signs of abating, but our commitment is clear: We will keep our readers informed in the face of any odds, and we will succeed.\u00a0 We are proud of the work we\u2019ve done, and we are not going to stop.\u00a0 If you have story ideas, tips or suggestions, please send them to news@dailyprogress.com.

Dr. Amy Mathers, an infectious disease physician and associate director of clinical microbiology, and Mendy Poulter, director of clinical microbiology, led the effort to create the tests at the university that were announced last week. Mathers said that, for now, the focus is on making sure that patients already at the hospital can get tested. \u201cI know it\u2019s creating a lot of anxiety in our community \u2026 but we really, really need to conserve because of all the supply chain issues,\u201d she said. \u201cWe really need to focus on making sure that we\u2019ve got coverage for our most vulnerable populations, the elderly, the sick, people that have symptoms and people that are in the hospital using up that protective gear waiting for testing results to come back.\u201d Since the university went live with its testing on March 18, it has been able to fairly quickly ramp up, Mathers said, in part because one of the commercial platforms to do higher numbers of tests a day was approved by the Food and Drug administration for use on March 19. \u201cSo as soon as that happened, we now have two methods for testing COVID virus at UVa, and so we\u2019ve been able to ramp up our capacity quite quickly,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re offering it, potentially, to other hospitals that are in desperate need of rapid turnaround time for their inpatients around the state because it\u2019s such a desperate need. We do have enough capacity to take care of our own community plus inpatients around the state. Mathers said the turnaround time for the UVa test is one to two days, while results from the Centers Disease Control and Prevention test are taking about five to seven business days. Instead of waiting until industry had a testing platform available that could be used in university labs, when Mathers\u2019 team heard about a novel coronavirus circulating in Wuhan, China, she said they started pushing to develop their own test at UVa. \u201cThe materials that you need to establish that test were said to be available \u2014 they were not available,\u201d she said. \u201cWe had to go to everybody we knew just knocking on door after door to try to resource the materials we needed to set up the test.\u201d The team raced to set up a testing platform: The machine that does the PCR, which makes millions of copies of a particular chain of DNA, and the software that runs and helps interpret the test. UVa researchers Melissa Kendall and James Casanova lent machines to the effort. \u201cThe [Food and Drug Administration] relaxed their guidance saying we had to have this one specific software and let us use a different version of software that was available in the research lab,\u201d Mathers said. \u201cJust coordinating with the FDA to get that allowance was a big deal.\u201d Another item needed \u2014 RNA extraction kits \u2014 also are in short supply. Karen Frank, a researcher at the National Institutes of Health, was able to send some kits over from her lab, Mathers said. \u201cThen we could never get the positive RNA viral control that you have to have to run any tests in your lab from the federal government, they just wouldn\u2019t ever acknowledge us trying to receive it,\u201d Mathers said. \u201cDespite us being told that they would send it within 48 hours of registering, we\u2019re still waiting on some of those materials, and that was March 5 that we started.\u201d Researchers at the University of Washington \u2014 who were combating their own outbreak around Seattle \u2014 sent UVa the positive control, which is needed to make sure the test is getting correct results, in two separate shipments. Researchers say that, in addition to the research options presented by a viable test, university labs increasing the state\u2019s testing capacity plays a vital public health role in handling the pandemic. Dr. Bill Petri, an infectious disease expert at UVa who did not work on the test but is working on a potential vaccine for the virus, said that it\u2019s hard to overestimate what a huge problem it is to not have the rapid ability to test people for COVID-19. State health officials said recently that they could test only 1,000 people total; nationally, despite rosy projections, officials have called limited and inaccurate tests \u201ca failing.\u201d \u201cWhat that we\u2019re beginning to understand is that as many as 86% of people with this infection have no symptoms whatsoever \u2026 so the ability to identify someone who is infected is very, very difficult right now without the ability to have better testing,\u201d Petri said. \u201cThe mathematical modelers of infectious diseases have estimated that it\u2019s really the people who have no symptoms are one of the major ways that this is getting spread \u2026 so that\u2019s the reason for all of us to distance ourselves from other people, until we\u2019re through the brunt of this epidemic,\u201d Petri said. Even as more tests come online, though, researchers continue to be affected by supply shortages as the demand for materials increase. \u201cLike the shelves of Walmart where the toilet paper is, that\u2019s what the shelves of materials for doing this testing look like right now,\u201d Mathers said. Mathers said that the team currently is low on nasopharyngeal swabs, and she\u2019s contacted more than 11 companies to try to get more. \u201cThey\u2019re the ideal swabs to collect COVID virus from a patient who\u2019s potentially infected,\u201d she said. \u201cYou have to have special swabs that don\u2019t interfere with the ability to detect that virus.\u201d They\u2019re also short on viral transport media, which is a fluid that helps keep the virus alive so it can be tested. \u201cSo a researcher at UVa has now turned his lab into a manufacturing center for that viral transport media to potentially be distributed to the state,\u201d Mathers said. Another major hurdle, Mathers said, was that the federal government put additional regulations in place to establish testing in the lab. She said that the FDA required that they had to submit additional testing and studies to show the exact performance of the test to the standard of the FDA so that that test could be distributed. \u201cNormally, when you do a test locally, you\u2019re not planning on distributing it, you\u2019re planning on doing it for your patients, and you follow the guidance of the College of American Pathologists and all of the regulations that oversee clinical laboratory testing,\u201d she said. \u201cFor some reason, the Food and Drug Administration got involved to make this much harder.\u201d During a public health emergency, labs and drug manufacturers must seek an Emergency Use Authorization from the FDA to use diagnostic tests and medical treatments that have not gone through the typical clearance process, a process that has been in place since 2004. Normally, laboratory-developed tests, like the ones researchers across the country have been racing to get online, cannot be used for clinical diagnoses without the FDA\u2019s approval, in an effort to ensure only accurate tests are conducted. Health officials in other parts of the country have said these regulations, and slow emergency authorizations, hampered their ability to respond; the FDA has since loosened some rules and increased state officials\u2019 ability to oversee laboratory efforts. \u201cThe whole story of the COVID virus from the diagnostic standpoint is a shortage, just managing shortages continuously, with additional regulation put in place for some unknown reason,\u201d Mathers said.","36":"RICHMOND\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Gov. Ralph Northam on Wednesday signed an executive order directing the state\u2019s health care facilities to postpone elective surgeries amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Northam\u2019s announcement comes as the state moves to build capacity at its health care facilities, anticipating surges due to COVID-19. \u201cThis will preserve bed space, and also equipment including ventilators, and [personal protective equipment],\u201d Northam said. The executive order does not apply to \u201cpatients with emergencies or urgent needs.\u201d It also does not apply to abortions, or \u201cthe full suite of family planning services,\u201d the order reads. Northam also said the state is \u201cexploring ways to make it easier for qualified medical professionals to help out,\u201d including reworking the state\u2019s licensing procedures and considering the use of medical school students. The state has also begun working with the U.S. Army Corp of Engineers to identify sites around the state that could be used as health care facilities, \u201cshould the need arise,\u201d Northam said. That could include a wide array of facilities, including empty higher education buildings. \u201cWe anticipate overburdening the capacity of our healthcare system,\u201d Northam said. \u201cWe see that coming. We want to prepare for that.\u201d In other news, Northam announced the state\u2019s public parks will be open during the day only. \u201cWe will close campgrounds cabins and bath houses, starting Friday morning. This is in line with what other states are doing, as well as some national parks,\u201d Northam said. - Mel Leonor  State officials urge Liberty University to limit campus access Virginia officials on Wednesday continued to urge Liberty University to limit access to its campus to slow the spread of COVID-19. Liberty University President Jerry Falwell, Jr., welcomed students back to campus this week, parting with what other universities are doing and attracting sharp criticism. The evangelical university houses roughly 5,000 students at its Lynchburg campus. \u201cWe have heard too many mixed messages around the country about COVID-19, and this is yet another example. Our message has been clear and it will continue to be clear. Stay home unless you have to leave for essential reasons,\u201d Northam said. Asked whether he could close the school, Northam said he does not have the authority to do so. Northam issued an executive order banning gatherings of 10 people or more under the penalty of a misdemeanor, which he has said local governments can enforce. \u201cWe appreciate our colleges and universities making accommodation for students with special cases. But that is very different from inviting students to leave their homes and come back to campus.\u201d Falwell has said most classes will be conducted online, but students are welcomed to reside at their dorms on campus. \u201cI think we have a responsibility to our students \u2014 who paid to be here, who want to be here, who love it here \u2014 to give them the ability to be with their friends, to continue their studies, enjoy the room and board they\u2019ve already paid for and to not interrupt their college life,\u201d Falwell told the Lynchburg News & Advance. - Mel Leonor  Dr. Lilian Peake, state epidemiologist for Virginia, said Wednesday that there have been three more coronavirus deaths reported in the state.\u00a0 The deaths were two adults in the Peninsula Health District and a man in the Pittsylvania\/Danville Health District. These bring the statewide death toll to 12 -- 7 in the Peninsula Health District, 2 in Henrico, 1 in Fairfax, 1 in Virginia Beach and 1 in Pittsylvania.  The Virginia Department of Health reported on its website Wednesday that 391 people in Virginia have tested positive for COVID-19. That's an increase of 101 cases, or 34.8 percent, from the 290 reported at noon Tuesday. There are coronavirus cases in 53 Virginia cities and counties, an increase of 11 since Tuesday. The VDH also said that 5,370 have been tested for the virus in Virginia, and there are nine deaths statewide. On March 19, state health officials said there\u2019s a lag in the reporting of statewide numbers, and figures on the VDH website might not include cases reported by individual localities or local health districts. The state has a 5 p.m. cutoff for tabulating daily numbers, so the numbers reported on the website each day are 19 hours old. This is the breakdown of cases across the state according to the VDH website: 76 - Fairfax County 46 - Arlington County 41 - James City County 32 - Prince William County 23 - Virginia Beach 20 - Loudoun County 20 - Henrico County 13 - Richmond 11 - Chesterfield County 9 - Alexandria 8 - York County 6 - Charlottesville 6 - Stafford County 5 - Norfolk 5 - Williamsburg 4 - Albemarle County 4 - Newport News 3 - Chesapeake 3 - Goochland County 3 - Louisa County 3 - Mecklenburg County 3 - Portsmouth 3 - Shenandoah County 3 - Spotsylvania County 2 - Bedford County 2 - Culpeper County 2 - Danville 2 - Frederick County 2 - Gloucester County 2 - Hanover County 2 - Harrisonburg 2 - Isle of Wight County 2 - Lee County 2 - Manassas City 2 - Prince Edward County 2 - Rockingham County 1 - Accomack County 1 - Amherst County 1 - Botetourt County 1 - Charles City County 1 - Fairfax City 1 - Fluvanna County 1 - Franklin County 1 - Fredericksburg 1 - Halifax County 1 - Madison County 1 - Mathews County 1 - Nelson County 1 - Nottaway County 1 - Orange County 1 - Roanoke County 1 - Rockbridge County 1 - Suffolk  VCU piloting COVID-19 test with goal of same-day results VCU Health System announced Wednesday that it is now piloting a COVID-19 test that it created in-house to identify whether hospitalized patients with severe symptoms are infected with the virus. The hospital system intends to use the test to confirm and rule out COVID-19 cases with a goal of same-day results, according to a press release. \u201cBeing able to determine whether a patient does or does not have COVID-19 quickly is of critical importance,\u201d said Christopher Doern, Ph.D., director of microbiology at VCU Health, in a press release. \u201cBeing able to do that in our own laboratory will be a game changer in how we manage patients with potential COVID-19 symptoms.\u201d UVA Health also created its own test, which it debuted on March 18 and announced Wednesday that it would be making available for other hospitals in Virginia and surrounding states to use. UVA Health has been testing between 25 and 50 people per day, the Daily Progress reported. According to Doern, the process to create a test would normally take a year or more, but the VCU Health team created it in less than two weeks. Still, a global shortage of the materials necessary for the test currently means that tests will be limited to those most likely to have COVID-19 who are hospitalized with severe symptoms. VCU Health will continue to administer tests from private and public state health labs for all patients with COVID-19 symptoms, even those less severe, according to the press release.","37":"Three local organizations that had been working on their own fundraising efforts for locals affected by the COVID-19 pandemic have consolidated their efforts into the Community Emergency Response Fund. Charlottesville and Albemarle County are partners in the effort. The fund was set up by the Charlottesville Area Community Foundation, and combines the work of Cville Community Cares, United Way of Greater Charlottesville, Charlottesville and Albemarle County. CACF, United Way and Cville Community Cares had each set up their own fundraising efforts. Brennan Gould, president and chief executive officer of CACF, said that the partnership was formed \u201cin order to promote an efficient, low-barrier and accessible process to distribute financial and other support that will stabilize households across the region.\u201d \u201cThe decision to come together was rooted in a belief that we all have unique strengths and resources to bring to this work and that this challenge is far bigger than any one organization can address on its own,\u201d Gould said. The Cville Community Cares team, a group of area individuals who organized to help the community, had started fundraising to help people who were put in a financial bind by COVID-19. The group had collected through online forms requests for $200 mini-grants and material support, such as groceries, from those affected. Congregate Charlottesville, a 501\u00a93 organization, agreed to distribute the money. Christina Rivera, co-president of Congregate Charlottesville, said Cville Community Cares was given a $16,000 matching donation to start, and that the group has raised $57,000. \u201cWe funded the vast majority of the requests that we got in, but even as we were coming to the end of that, we could see that we were going to have more requests than we had funds for,\u201d she said. Cville Community Cares has distributed about $95,000 to people who requested assistance. \u201cThe community foundation funded that gap,\u201d Rivera said. \u201cIn total, we will end up using those funds to fully disperse all of the requests that we got that we were able to approve for filling.\u201d More than $2 million has been raised for the Community Emergency Response Fund with donations from the Bama Works Fund of Dave Matthews Band, Batten Family Fund, Adiuvans Relief Fund, Quantitative Foundation, two anonymous donors, United Way of Greater Charlottesville, Wells Fargo, Tremaine Family Foundation and the support of more than 200 other contributors. Donations can be made at cacfonline.org. Those in need can call (434) 234-4490 from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday through Friday, to talk to someone who will help decide if the fund is the right fit or if other programs are better, Gould said. The amount of support will be determined on a case-by-case basis. Households in Charlottesville and Albemarle, Buckingham, Fluvanna, Greene, Louisa, Nelson and Orange counties are eligible to receive help from the Community Emergency Response Fund. Gould said the partnership also is learning about the needs of community-based organizations that are providing food, housing and medical supplies, and that it will announce next steps in a process to support organizations as resources allow. \u201cBecause this is a rapidly changing situation with a number of unknowns, we have not earmarked funds in any concrete way at this time in terms of how much to individuals and how much to community based organizations,\u201d she said. \u201cAll of the funds raised are focused on these two strategies right now and we aim to deploy them across our service area in ways that are most helpful to stabilizing households.\u201d There are many other efforts to raise funds for those who have lost their jobs. New City Arts and The Bridge have launched Charlottesville Emergency Relief Fund for Artists for Charlottesville-area artists who have lost income due to the cancellation of specific, scheduled gigs or opportunities due to COVID-19. Artists from Charlottesville and Albemarle, Fluvanna, Greene, Louisa, or Nelson counties are able to request $300 from the fund. Kate Ellwood, a former general manager at Citizen Burger Bar, started the Charlottesville Restaurant Community Fund through GoFundMe to help local restaurant workers who have been laid off from their jobs, which has raised more than $28,000. Easton Porter Group, which operates Pippin Hill Farm and Vineyards and Red Pump Kitchen, has started a GoFundMe for its employees. \u201cLaying off our employees was an extremely difficult and painful decision,\u201d Dean Porter Andrews, Easton Porter Group co-founder and CEO, said in a statement on the page. \u201cOur goal is to do everything possible to make sure that once we get through this crisis, we are stable enough to reopen our businesses. We hope that, with your help and generosity, these layoffs will be temporary and we can mitigate some of the struggles our employees will now face.\u201d Natasha Lawler, a UVa Children\u2019s Advisory Board member, and Jennifer Eberline are raising money to buy UVa nurses $50 gift cards to local restaurants and are asking community members to make cards for the nurses. The gift cards will first go to nurses at UVa, but the pair is hoping to expand the effort to nurses at Sentara Martha Jefferson Hospital, as well as first responders, paramedics, doctors and other healthcare workers. Handmade cards can be dropped off in a plastic bin at 1415 Dairy Road in Charlottesville, or email natashamlawler@gmail.com for a mailing address. Additionally, after local pediatrician Dr. Paige Perriello sounded the alarm about low levels of personal protective equipment for health care workers, the group Support Cville, which is organizing information about various local aid groups on its website, started an effort called Equip Cville, to gather needed masks, gloves, cleaners and other gear. The group is collecting donations and physical goods can be dropped off daily at Champion Brewing Company from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m.","38":"Charlottesville officials said Wednesday that Gov. Ralph Northam isn\u2019t doing enough to force residents throughout the state to stay at home to stop the spread of COVID-19. Officials sent a letter to the governor\u2019s office Wednesday morning as the City Council took measures to ensure the local government can remain functional. Governments across the world are taking measures to stop the spread of COVID-19, the illness caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, or SARS-CoV-2, which has created a global pandemic. In letters sent Tuesday, city officials ask Northam to revise his Monday executive order that shuttered restaurants and restricted public gatherings to mirror stricter shelter-in-place style orders issued in New York, California and Louisiana. \u201cCOVID-19 is spreading rapidly throughout our nation as over 9,000 confirmed cases of the virus have been reported in America on March 23 alone,\u201d Mayor Nikuyah Walker wrote in the letter, which was sent on behalf of the entire City Council. \u201cVirginia must take action now to halt the spread of COVID-19 before it results in further illness and death within the Commonwealth,\u201d Walker wrote. \u201cThe Council does not believe that this Executive Order\u2019s social distancing measures are sufficient to contain the spread of COVID-19 in Virginia.\u201d The Thomas Jefferson Health District on Wednesday confirmed 22 presumptive positive cases in the district. Seven of those cases are in the city. According to data from the Virginia Department of Health, Charlottesville has the sixth-highest instance of coronavirus cases per capita in the state. The letter sent by Charlottesville Police Chief RaShall Brackney and Fire Chief Andrew Baxter is essentially the same as that sent by City Council. \u201cThis is a public health emergency, and we urge you to act immediately to protect the health, safety, and welfare of our fellow Virginians,\u201d Brackney and Baxter wrote. For example, the Louisiana order, signed by Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards, allows residents to leave their homes to go to the grocery, pharmacy, medical appointments, take-out, delivery or drive-thru orders at restaurants, care for a friend or family member, walks, jogs, bicycle rides and exercise, providing at least a six-foot distance is kept between people. However, Northam\u2019s press secretary, Alena Yarmosky, said that Northam\u2019s executive order accomplishes the same measures as those in other states, adding that localities are responsible for enforcing the order. Northam banned gatherings of 10 or more people and violation of the order is a class-one misdemeanor, which carries up to a year in jail and up to a $2,500 fine. \u201cRegardless of what you call it \u2014 a \u201cshutdown\u201d or a \u201cstay-at-home order\u201d \u2014 Virginia\u2019s actions are in line with a number of other states that are taking aggressive measures to combat the spread of COVID-19,\u201d Yarmosky said in an emailed statement. \u201cAgain, the governor is urging Virginians: stay at home except for essential travel. He looks forward to working with Charlottesville and other localities to make sure this order is enforced.\u201d City spokesman Brian Wheeler said officials want the governor to have a clearer message. \u201cThe governor\u2019s order in Virginia is a series of separate closure orders, but it does not in any way tell citizens to stay in their residences unless they are performing a specific function,\u201d he said. \u201cThe city of Charlottesville believes time is of the essence to make this more clear to Virginians.\u201d Wheeler said the city has received \u201cseveral calls\u201d about enforcement, but hasn\u2019t issued any citations. Electronic meetings The city letters were sent shortly before a special meeting Wednesday morning where the council adopted an ordinance allowing it to conduct electronic meetings in narrow circumstances, particularly on the city\u2019s budget. The ordinance allows the council to hold electronic meetings to conduct business to discuss the state of emergency around the coronavirus pandemic or items related to the continuity of government, such as the city\u2019s budget. The ordinance also allows electronic public hearings for such continuity-related items. The public can participate in the hearings electronically or submit comments before, during or up to five days after the hearings. Attorney General Mark Herring provided guidance to local governments about the parameters of electronic meetings on Friday, according to Loudoun Now. City Attorney John Blair said the ordinance helps \u201cprotect everyone\u2019s health and safety.\u201d He noted measures such as broadcasting a webinar and on Facebook Live that are keeping the public involved. \u201cWe\u2019re trying our best to maximize public participation,\u201d he said. For any measures that require a public hearing, the ordinance allows the city to use all means possible to allow participation. Megan Rhyne, executive director of the Virginia Coalition for Open Government, said the situation is evolving each day, but the city is on the leading edge. \u201cWhat I\u2019ve seen is most localities trying to strike the right balance between safety and transparency, and I certainly think Charlottesville is on the better side of that equation right now,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause this is such a fluid and, as the governor keeps saying, a dynamic situation, both governments and the public are going to have to continually recalibrate what their abilities and expectations and aspirations are.\u201d Councilor Sena Magill has been participating in meetings electronically since March 10 under an existing electronic meeting policy after exhibiting coronavirus symptoms. Magill and Councilor Lloyd Snook attended a national conference earlier this month where two people later tested positive for COVID-19. The ordinance officially declares any items that were planned for the City Council, Planning Commission, all boards and authorities as continued for the duration of the emergency. City panels can still meet, but only if a quorum of members are physically present, essentially placing decisions on hold. Councilor Michael Payne wrote on Twitter that Neighborhood Development Services staff are still working on everything that has already been submitted. The ordinance allows the city to dive back into its budget process, which was brought to a halt as the pandemic spread. Earlier this month, the council held a mostly electronic hearing on the proposed $196.7 million spending plan for fiscal 2021, which begins July 1, and the proposed tax rate. It\u2019s unclear just how much the proposal will change with a possible dip in revenues from businesses closing due to the virus. A second public hearing is scheduled for April 6, with final approval planned for April 14. It\u2019s unclear if those dates will change. Under state law, the final budget doesn\u2019t need to be approved until June 30. The next work session listed on the city\u2019s website is 10 a.m. April 7. Scottsville Town Council will consider a similar electronic meeting ordinance on Thursday, Town Administrator Matt Lawless said during electronic public comment at Wednesday\u2019s special meeting. The Albemarle County Board of Supervisors announced Wednesday night that it will take up a similar measure to Charlottesville\u2019s at a meeting Friday morning. The agenda includes a discussion item labeled \u201cconsider removing \u2018From the Public: Matters Not Listed for Public Hearing on the Agenda\u2019 from the Board of Supervisors\u2019 agendas during the COVID-19 emergency and disaster.\u201d","39":"Efforts by University of Virginia Health System researchers to increase UVa\u2019s COVID-19 testing capacity received a $1 million boost on Thursday in the form of a grant from the Charlottesville-based Quantitative Foundation. The additional funding could increase the number of tests administered daily from 200 to 500, including patients at other hospitals, clinical providers and first responders, according to a news release. The expanded capacity comes as a shortage of tests has hampered the ability of care providers across the country to accurately diagnose patients and isolate those with the disease. \u201cThis capability will give UVa Health care providers extremely rapid diagnosis, allowing severely ill patients presenting to our emergency room to be quickly tested for COVID-19, for optimal patient management, and giving the information needed to health care providers to keep themselves safe as well,\u201d Dr. Christopher Moskaluk, director of the UVa Medical Labs and chairman of UVa\u2019s Department of Pathology, said in the release. Facing a national shortage of tests for the virus and a lag time of between five and 10 days for results, UVa researchers, led by laboratory directors Mendy Poulter and Dr. Amy Mathers, worked on developing their own in-house testing. The resulting test cut turnaround time for results to 24 hours. Since UVa Health began testing for COVID-19, faculty, administrators and staff have been working around the clock to expand testing capabilities. Jaffray Woodriff, co-founder and CEO of Quantitative Investment Management and trustee of the Quantitative Foundation, said the donation is to researchers\u2019 efforts and the medical community. He is a 1991 graduate of UVa\u2019s McIntire School of Commerce and lives in the area. In 2019, he made the largest donation in UVa\u2019s history to set up a data science school. \u201cAs a resident of the community, I just wanted to find a way to help in any way I could and hopefully this will support the good work that\u2019s already underway at UVa Health to prevent the spread of the virus,\u201d he said in the release. \u201cWe are incredibly thankful for this generous support, which comes at a critical time and provides an enormous lift to our efforts to serve the public during this pandemic,\u201d UVa Executive Vice President for Health Affairs Dr. K. Craig Kent said. \u201cThese funds will truly make a profound difference.\u201d COVID-19 testing is currently taking place during the day shift at UVa laboratories due to the limited number of trained personnel. The funds will help support a new lab tech position. Combined with cross-training of existing laboratory personnel, the donation will allow testing in a second shift, significantly expanding capacity. The funds also will be used to order equipment to increase testing capacity. \u201cThis capability will allow much broader screening of our population to aid in the control of disease,\u201d Moskaluk said. Also on Thursday, the university announced that its Biocomplexity Institute is part of a $10 million, five-year effort to study, prepare for and respond to epidemics and pandemics. The Expeditions in Computing effort, which includes epidemiologists at UVa, as well as at Stanford University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Princeton University, Virginia Tech and two national laboratories, is working with local, regional, national and international public health agencies and universities to apply and deploy new technologies \u2014 many developed at the UVa Biocomplexity Institute \u2014 to predict and manage current and future epidemics and pandemics. The project is designed to improve epidemic planning and response by providing computational tools to epidemiologists worldwide; increasing surveillance of disease-spreading conditions; using weather and climate forecasting to likewise forecast epidemics; provide planning tools to policymakers to help in the allocation of resources such as vaccines and ventilators; and studying how social and political structures affect disease progression.","40":"Charlottesville and Albemarle County had a combined 1,179 jobless claims last week, up from 29 the previous week, according to the Virginia Employment Commission. Similar spikes in claims are occurring across the state and country. On March 20, the city sent out approximately 1,700 letters from Mayor Nikuyah Walker to property managers advocating for voluntary actions to reduce burdens on tenants. The letter recommends asking tenants who cannot pay rent for April or May to submit a written request for relief, including a general description of their household situation. It recommends installment payment plans and waiving late fees or penalties for those only paying partial rent in April and May. The letter asks landlords to refer tenants who are struggling to the city\u2019s Department of Human Services. \u201cWe can\u2019t mandate that landlords do anything,\u201d Walker said in a video town hall Thursday. \u201cThe letter was an attempt to just get landlords to think about the situation that we are experiencing.\u201d Meanwhile, area officials boosted their call for residents to stop the spread of the novel coronavirus. Charlottesville, Albemarle, the University of Virginia and the Thomas Jefferson Health District put out a joint statement Thursday pushing for more stringent adherence to Gov. Ralph Northam\u2019s recent executive order. \u201cWe recognize that this is a challenging time for our community,\u201d the statement says. \u201cIf you have not yet adopted social distancing, please do so now \u2014 maintain at least 6 feet from others outside your immediate family and avoid large gatherings of people. This applies in your home, on the sidewalk, in parks, grocery stores and other essential stores.\u201d The statement comes after city officials said Wednesday that Northam wasn\u2019t doing enough to force residents throughout the state to stay at home amid the pandemic. Northam has banned gatherings of 10 or more people. Violation of the order is a Class 1 misdemeanor, which carries a sentence of up to a year in jail and up to a $2,500 fine. \u201cIt\u2019s important for now that we only come into contact with people we absolutely have to and we only come into places we absolutely have to,\u201d Walker said. Appearing on the newly launched Cville360 program, Walker said that Tuesday\u2019s letters were asking Northam to specifically order people to stay home. \u201cThat was the purpose of the letter \u2014 to get mandated stay in your home,\u201d she said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t get that. \u2026 I definitely would like more clear direction.\u201d The joint statement says that if the city, county or university police departments view large gatherings or receive a complaint, the initial violation will be handled with education and guidance. Further violations will result in charges. The city officially launched Cville360 on Thursday as a video broadcast focused on sharing the latest information on the city\u2019s response to the virus. The broadcast is hosted by city spokesman Brian Wheeler and will be held at 11 a.m. Tuesdays and 4 p.m. Thursdays for the foreseeable future. Viewers can participate by registering at charlottesville.org\/zoom. Walker and City Manager Tarron Richardson were on the program Thursday. Richardson emphasized that while City Hall is closed to the public, the city is still open for business. \u201cWe are still open for business,\u201d he said. \u201cThat was one of the major things I wanted to make sure happened. I wanted to make sure we were still able to provide our public services to the community.\u201d Walker said the pandemic is changing area operations every day and the city needs to be straightforward with residents. \u201cWe have to be able to say to people honestly that we can\u2019t say with 100% certainty that we can keep you safe,\u201d she said. The next Cville360 will feature Fire Chief Andrew Baxter, Councilor Heather Hill and Kathryn Goodman, spokeswoman for the Thomas Jefferson Health District. New cases The Thomas Jefferson Health District on Thursday confirmed 27 presumptive positive cases in the district, an increase of five from Wednesday. No new cases were reported in Albemarle County, which remains at nine, Fluvanna County, which has three, or Nelson County, which has one. Greene County now has its first case, Charlottesville has an additional diagnosis that brings its total to eight cases and Louisa has a new case, bringing its total to five. The Virginia Department of Health reported Thursday that 460 people in Virginia have tested positive for COVID-19. Cases have been reported in 62 Virginia cities and counties, with 13 deaths statewide. State health officials have said there\u2019s a 19-hour lag in the reporting of statewide numbers, and figures on the website might not include cases reported by individual localities or local health districts. \u201cThe data is a little bit delayed, but at this point we know it is going up every day,\u201d Wheeler said. However, the state health department on Thursday reported nine cases in Charlottesville. Trail closings, bottles sought The U.S. Forest Service announced Thursday that all campgrounds, bathrooms, trail shelters, day-use areas and off-highway vehicle trails are temporarily closed. A portion of the Jefferson National Forest covers Nelson County. The Emergency Operations Center for Charlottesville, Albemarle and UVa announced Thursday that it is partnering with Silverback Distillery to fulfill a need for hand sanitizer. The Afton-based distillery announced last week that it had shifted gears from crafting whiskey, gin and vodka to creating hand sanitizer for medical staff and first responders. The Emergency Operations Center is accepting donations of empty bottles to use for the hand sanitizer. Empty bottles with lids can be dropped off through 2 p.m. Friday at CMA\u2019s Colonial Nissan, 200 Myers Drive. For more information about donating bottles, call (434) 297-8415.","41":"Charlottesville City Councilor Sena Magill found out Friday that she has tested negative for COVID-19 after 10 days of waiting for results. Magill announced the results with a simple, one-sentence statement on her campaign Twitter page. \u201cJust got the news: COVID-19 test came back negative,\u201d she wrote on the SenaforCville page. Magill, 47, was in Washington, D.C., from March 7 to March 9 to attend the National League of Cities conference. At least two people have tested positive for the virus after attending the conference and many went into self-quarantine, including people from Fort Collins, Colorado; San Antonio, Texas; Wichita, Kansas; Spartanburg, South Carolina, and Winston-Salem, North Carolina. City Councilor Lloyd Snook also attended the meeting but did not self-quarantine and has said he has had no symptoms. The increasing number of COVID-19 cases across the state is creating an increase in the number of government and agency offices shutting down to the public. The City of Charlottesville said Friday that it was closing parking areas at the following parks effective immediately: Pen Park, McIntire Park, Tonsler Park and Washington Park. \u201cIf the city observes too many visitors at a particular park which precludes safe social distancing, we will follow a process to close the park entirely,\u201d a news release stated. The city also said that it would continue the closure of City Hall and offices at the City Hall Annex, parks and recreation and public works departments through April 12. Non-essential personnel have been told to work from home if possible, depending on the type of work they conduct for the city. Those employees were largely city leadership and positions designated by department directors. Non-essential personnel who can not work from home will be compensated at their normal salary rate thru the closure. \u201cI\u2019m trying to do everything possible I can to ensure that our employees stay on the payroll,\u201d City Manager Tarron Richardson said in a virtual town hall on Thursday. Richardson said he\u2019s asked department heads to find ways to cut expenses so employees can continue to receive a paycheck. \u201cAs we move forward, if conditions do improve we can make adjustments,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to make sure everyone keeps working, our workforce continues to work.\u201d Albemarle County officials closed office buildings to the general public beginning at 5 p.m. Friday and will keep them closed indefinitely. County officials asked residents to visit the county website, www.albemarle.org, to see if the site has an answer to, or a way to address any needs and issues. \u201cWe\u2019re still here for you. Visit our website to see if your needs can be met online,\u201d the statement reads. \u201cYou can also call the department or staff person you need directly.\u201d The county\u2019s information line, (434) 243-7929, will remain operable weekdays from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., according to the statement. Although most county offices will be closed, there are limited hours open for a few. Community Development will be open Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, from 8:30 a.m. to 4 p.m.; The Albemarle County Police Department will be available through an intercom with visitors restricted to the department\u2019s lobby, except with an escort; and voter registration will receive in-person absentee voters for the Scottsville Town Council election. Online fees for payments by e-check will be waived, beginning in April, officials said. The Charlottesville Office of Elections and Voter Registration announced on Friday that it, too, would close to the public beginning Monday. Office staff will answer phones and email, Monday through Friday from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. as it prepares for June 9 primaries for U.S Senate and House of Representatives. Voters may register to vote or submit an absentee ballot online at the Department of Elections website, vote.elections.virginia.gov. Voting officials recommend voters request a mailed absentee ballot using reason code 2A on the application. The Voter Registration Office said it will provide more information about this election as deadlines approach and it receives further guidance from the Department of Elections. The Charlottesville Albemarle Convention & Visitors Bureau announced that area visitor centers will remain closed until further notice, also due to COVID-19. The centers have been closed since March 13. The closures affect the centers on the Charlottesville Downtown Mall and the Albemarle Tourism & Adventure Center in Crozet. These measures are consistent with other visitor and welcome centers in Virginia. Bureau staff will respond to visitor inquiries placed via email or phone. Also on Friday, the chancellor of the Virginia Community College System announced that spring semester students would receive pass\/no-pass grades with an option for a letter grade to reflect college classes that were cut short by COVID-19. \u201cMy hope in taking this step is that students will not be disadvantaged on their transcripts by a global pandemic that is beyond their control,\u201d Chancellor Glenn DuBois said in a blog post. \u201cSome will face additional challenges in having their courses moved from the classroom to the keyboard. Others will encounter the COVID-19 virus itself, afflicting them, a family member they care for, or even their instructor.\u201d DuBois said withdrawal dates for classes have been extended to the end of the semester, as well. Area Kroger store employees got the corporate OK on Thursday to wear protective masks and gloves while working and the company has stepped up employee safety with Plexiglas sneeze guards at cashier stations. The stores have also waived fees for advance ordering and curbside pickup during the COVID-19 crisis. \u201cWe are committed to protecting the health and safety of our associates,\u201d company officials said in a statement. \u201cKroger is installing Plexiglas shields at many cash registers to further promote physical distancing. Many of our stores are beginning the installation process this week, and we anticipate every check lane having a partition, including pharmacy counters, within the next several weeks.\u201d Over the last two weeks, The Kroger Company has hired 18,000 associates for full-time and part-time positions across the country.","42":"RICHMOND \u2014 Pharmacists across Virginia are reporting questionable prescriptions for a suite of drugs that have been promoted as unproven treatments for COVID-19, the disease caused by a new strain of coronavirus. On Wednesday, Virginia Health Commissioner Dr. Norman Oliver issued a letter warning of a \u201csurge in demand\u201d for medications commonly used to treat malaria, lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, HIV and other conditions. \u201cThis is leading to an inadequate medication supply for patients already taking these medications for chronic conditions and hospitalized COVID-19 patients being treated with these medications under facility-specific treatment protocols while studies are ongoing,\u201d he wrote. On Friday, U.S. Attorneys Thomas G. Cullen, of the Western District of Virginia, and G. Zachary Terwilliger, of the Eastern District of Virginia, in a news release acknowledged Oliver\u2019s concerns. The pair said they would monitor the situation as part of their COVID-19 Fraud Task Force. \u201cAt a time when many doctors, nurses, and first responders are risking their health and personal safety to treat those affected by the coronavirus, it is incredibly disturbing that a selfish minority in that field may be undermining these valiant efforts by prescribing outside legitimate medical practice,\u201d Cullen said in the release. Virginia is far from the only state seeing a spike in requests. The drugs hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine \u2014 anti-malarials that are often prescribed to prevent flare-ups in patients with lupus and arthritis \u2014 have made national headlines since President Donald Trump touted them as potential treatments for coronavirus. Dr. Dave Dixon, an associate professor and vice chair for clinical services at the VCU School of Pharmacy, said doctors and patients have started requesting those specific medications as a preventive measure against the disease, despite no evidence that they\u2019re effective in that capacity. \u201cThere was a very small pilot study looking at hydroxychloroquine with some promising results,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a result, you started having folks request prescriptions and wanting to take it for prophylaxis, which is not what they look at in the study at all.\u201d Overall, there\u2019s been a significant increase in demand for hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine and other pharmaceuticals being examined for their potential to treat COVID-19. Dr. Joshua Crawford, the director of clinical pharmacy services for Bon Secours Mercy Health System, said there\u2019s even been requests for HIV medications such as Kaletra, a combination of two antiviral drugs that was used on a small group of COVID-19 patients in Singapore. A larger, more recent study in the New England Journal of Medicine showed the medication wasn\u2019t more effective at treating severe symptoms of coronavirus than standard supportive care. Crawford said most experts have \u201cmoved on\u201d from hopes that HIV medications could be a cure for COVID-19, but the demand still hasn\u2019t stopped completely. \u201cThis is how desperate people are,\u201d he added. \u201cWe\u2019re grasping at studies that normally we would not pay much attention to.\u201d In his letter to clinicians, Oliver noted that there is currently no proven cure for COVID-19. The data from clinical trials is still so preliminary that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention isn\u2019t even recommending investigational treatments for patients with the disease. But Crawford said that hasn\u2019t stopped doctors and patients from pinning their hopes on certain drugs. Dr. Justin Vesser, the interim manager for ambulatory pharmacy at the University of Virginia Health System, said there already have been a handful of unusual prescriptions for the medications included in Oliver\u2019s letter. Crawford said Bon Secours pharmacists have observed physicians writing prescriptions for themselves or their family members, a problem that\u2019s been reported in other areas of the country. \u201cI understand where they\u2019re coming from, I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s something we can afford to do as a society right now,\u201d he continued. While Virginia hasn\u2019t banned the practice \u2014 an emergency measure taken by at least six other states \u2014 Oliver called on pharmacists to restrict certain medications in outpatient settings and pay particular attention to make sure prescriptions appeared valid. Vesser said common warning signs could include a prescription for a lupus medication coming from an anesthesiologist, or a dentist \u2014 any provider whose scope doesn\u2019t ordinarily include the disease. \u201cI think there are situations where they\u2019re trying to get medication in the hands of people who need it,\u201d he continued. \u201cBut it\u2019s our job to do the same thing we\u2019d do in any context, which is to make sure there\u2019s a bona fide relationship between the patient, the provider and the pharmacist.\u201d Doctors hoarding prescriptions on a \u201cjust-in-case\u201d basis is only part of the issue, Crawford said. Much of the demand for certain medications is driven by health systems across the country, all of whom are preparing for a major influx in COVID-19 patients. While the CDC and federal Food and Drug Administration aren\u2019t recommending treatments, Crawford said that doesn\u2019t necessarily square with what doctors are experiencing in the field. Most providers and hospitals share dozens of messages a day and hold regular meetings to discuss emerging and experimental treatments. Hydroxychloroquine, for instance, is still being examined as a possible treatment in the United States and other countries. As a result, hospitals are stocking up on the drug to treat their own COVID-19 patients and people who are already taking the drug for chronic diseases. \u201cFrom a pharmacy standpoint, we\u2019re trying to buy the meds that we think we\u2019re going to need for the amount of people we expect to come in,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen everyone does that at once, it takes away the supply that\u2019s out there. No one feels like we bought more than we\u2019re going to use.\u201d Bon Secours is reserving its supply of hydroxychloroquine to hospitalized patients with severe and confirmed cases of COVID-19, and to patients of its retail pharmacies who take the medication for conditions such as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. Meanwhile, the national supply of many of these drugs is already running short. The American Society of Health-System Pharmacists added chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine to its shortage list on Tuesday. Christina Barrille, executive director of the Virginia Pharmacists Association, said one of her members had to obtain prior authorization from an insurance company before he could refill a patient\u2019s regular supply of lupus medication. It\u2019s a growing concern for pharmacists across the commonwealth. As providers seek out experimental COVID-19 treatments, patients with chronic disease are suddenly at risk of losing the drugs they\u2019ve depended on for years. The American Medical Association, American Pharmacists Association and American Society of Health-System Pharmacists recently issued a joint statement condemning prescription stockpiling by health providers, writing that it could have \u201cgrave consequences\u201d for the community. \u201cThese treatments are based on patients having access to their medication on a regular schedule,\u201d Vesser said. \u201cAnd if we disrupt their ability to get them, that could set a lot of people back.\u201d","43":"As the scale of the crisis has grown, so has the magnitude of this community\u2019s response. In addition to front-line care for the sick provided by its physicians, nurses, aides, technicians and other staff, the University of Virginia Health System unleashed a next-level response when it developed a faster test for COVID-19. With delays across the country caused by both a shortage of tests and difficulties at overworked and undersupplied labs, it could take five to 10 days to determine if someone had the novel coronavirus. UVa researchers, led by laboratory directors Mendy Poulter and Dr. Amy Mathers, worked to develop their own in-house testing. The results were dramatic: a turnaround of a mere 24 hours in obtaining results. Now, the Charlottesville-based Quantitative Foundation has donated $1 million to expand the hospital\u2019s testing ability even further. The foundation is a philanthropic vehicle for UVa McIntire School of Business graduate Jaffray Woodriff, co-founder and CEO of Quantitative Investment Management, based in Charlottesville. The donation will allow UVa to add both equipment and personnel to expand capability from 200 tests daily to a possible 500. Tests could be shared with other hospitals and personnel such as first responders. The more quickly health care workers can process tests, the sooner patients can be treated \u2014 and, ultimately, the safer we all will be. Thanks to UVa Health Systems and its personnel and to Mr. Woodriff for these needed advancements. Also of note is the work of area nonprofits whose goal is to provide aid directly to people hit by the economic impacts of the health crisis. This past week, three of those organizations combined their efforts for greater effectiveness. Cville Community Cares is a newcomer to the local scene, founded swiftly in response to the global pandemic. The group collects requests from individuals for emergency mini-grants to, such as money for groceries. Congregate Charlottesville, an already established 501(c)3 organization, agreed to distribute the grants. The group raised $57,000, but requests were exceeding available funding. The Charlottesville Area Community Foundation stepped in to meet the additional need. The CACF also had set up its own COVID-related fundraising effort due. So had the United Way of Greater Charlottesville. Both have long been active in the local community and have earned reputations for efficiency and integrity. The three groups \u2014 one new, two well-established \u2014 combined their efforts this week as the Community Emergency Response Fund. The fund has raised more than $2 million in small donations from individuals alongside large donations from sources such as the Bama Works Fund of Dave Matthews Band, the Batten Family Fund, Adiuvans Relief Fund, the Quantitative Foundation, the United Way, Wells Fargo and the Tremaine Family Foundation. Large or small, the gifts add up. And they\u2019re necessary to support the needs, which are also piling up among families deprived of regular income or facing unexpected expenses. Donations can be made at cacfonline.org. Requests for aid can be made by calling (434) 234-4490 from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday through Friday; there, a staff member will help determine if the CERF can supply the need or if another program is a better source of help. Our thanks as well to the CERF and its member organizations, and to the generous donors who are funding its relief efforts. This is an amazing community. The times are hard, but we are hanging together to help each other.","44":"The virus, officially named SARS-CoV-2, is a fast-moving illness machine that has found the right mix of lethality and communicability to lift itself to the level of the first pandemic in 100 years. The here-to-fore unknown coronavirus is more easily spread than are influenza viruses and proves fatal in far more cases, especially among older people and those with underlying medical conditions. Because the virus is so new, researchers and clinicians across the world are scrambling to determine everything from how it\u2019s transmitted to why it affects different age groups differently. The flu is estimated to kill one in every 1,000 confirmed cases. The COVID-19-causing virus appears to kill one or two of every 100 confirmed cases, according to studies of cases across the world. \u201cCOVID-19 is nothing like the seasonal flu,\u201d said Dr. Lilian Peake, state epidemiologist with the Virginia Department of Health. \u201cThere isn\u2019t a vaccine against it, so we can\u2019t vaccinate against it and decrease the number of people who can become infected. We don\u2019t have a specific antiviral treatment like we do for influenza. Also, we\u2019re seeing more severe illness and higher percentages of people having severe disease and even death from this.\u201d The virus has SARS in its name because it has similar aspects to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus that became an epidemic in 2003, afflicting areas of Asia. An estimated one in 10 people who caught that virus died, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other health agencies. But that virus could only be transmitted by close contact with a sick person, studies showed. That contact included kissing, embracing, sharing eating or drinking utensils, talking to someone within three feet, physical examination and other direct physical contact, according to the CDC. The new virus is not as lethal by the numbers, but it is far easier to contract than the original SARS virus and has quickly spread throughout the world, leaving far more deaths in its wake. \u201cPeople make the flu comparison because [SARS-CoV-2] is a virus that spreads through the population, affects older people and spreads in the same method. It\u2019s definitely not the same thing, though,\u201d said Dr. Taison Bell, an expert in internal medicine, infectious diseases and critical care at the UVa Health System. He\u2019s also the assistant director of the medical intensive care unit at the UVa Medical Center. Bell said the flu and the COVID-19 virus travel in the same method. An infected person sneezes or coughs or in some other way deposits the virus on a surface, usually in a wet droplet of some sort. Then another person happens along and touches the virus-packed wet spot. \u201cWe get the virus on the surface and then someone touches that surface and gets the virus on their hand and then touches a wet spot on their face, like their eyes or nose or mouth,\u201d Bell said. For the flu, one person may infect 1.3 other people, what is known as the R-number, Bell said. SARS-CoV-2 has an R-number of 2.5, meaning it spreads more than twice as fast as the flu. In comparison, the R-number of measles is between 12 and 18. \u201cThis virus is higher than a slow-churning virus making its way through the population, but it\u2019s nothing like measles,\u201d Bell said. \u201cFrom the perspective of a virus, you don\u2019t want to be so serious that your host dies before you can infect someone else. You want to be able to be passed around before that happens so you want to spread as rapidly as possible through a population. There\u2019s often a big difference between how deadly a virus is and how quickly it spreads. When you hit that sweet spot, you have a pandemic.\u201d For most influenza viruses, a person gets sick between one and four days after contracting the virus, according to the CDC. The illness lasts about seven days, which means for seven to 12 days, the virus can be passed on. For the COVID-19 virus, it takes as long as 14 days from exposure to symptoms and can last as long as a month after symptoms begin, according to a study by Harvard Medical School updated Friday. \u201cFor the flu, it takes one to three days before symptoms show, and you\u2019re infectious about a day before you feel the symptoms,\u201d Bell said. \u201cWith the coronavirus, the middle of the time range is about five days and it appears as though you can spread long before you get symptoms.\u201d The virus kicks off with a fever that can be as high as 102 degrees, according to the CDC. That is the most likely tipoff to COVID-19, Bell said. \u201cThe thing about COVID is about 90% will have a fever at some point and it\u2019s usually at the start,\u201d he said. \u201cOf course, that often shows with the flu, too.\u201d Although 80% of cases appear with mild symptoms, when the virus kicks into high gear, it can cause crippling fatigue and deadly pneumonia that fills both lungs with fluid and restricts breathing to the point that a patient needs a mechanical respirator to avoid respiratory failure. Respiratory failure, according to the CDC, is when the lungs cannot pull in enough oxygen to supply the body and organs begin to fail. The breathing issues caused by COVID-19 can lead to emergency rooms crowded with patients gasping for air and full intensive care units with patients attached to respirators that breathe for them. That is currently occurring in New York, according to the CDC and New York state health officials. \u201cIf you have a busy ER and your ICU is full and all of the respirators you have are taken up and someone comes in with respiratory failure but you have no more equipment available to treat them, that person isn\u2019t going to live,\u201d Bell said. For Virginians, that has yet to become a reality. Experts hope it won\u2019t. \u201cWe\u2019re at the beginning of the outbreak occurring in Virginia and we do expect the number of cases to go up,\u201d Peake said. \u201cAt some point, they will level off and decline, but we do expect those numbers to go up for a while. The more we can practice that social distancing, the more that [sharp increase] can be blunted.\u201d \u201cThe cases are still going up at an exponential rate and that means more people will need critical care,\u201d Bell said. \u201cWe expect we\u2019ll have more people getting sick, and we\u2019ve made preparations for that.\u201d Exactly how long the virus will be affecting the country is hard to say, Peake said. \u201cIt did last for months in other countries as it circulated through the communities, so I think we can expect that, but I don\u2019t have a crystal ball. None of us does,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have to continue to track it and look at the information every day.\u201d Gov. Ralph Northam\u2019s ordering the closing of businesses, restaurants and parks and imploring Virginians to stay home are efforts designed to keep to a minimum the number of people getting critically sick at the same time and competing for critical care, Bell and Peake said. \u201cIt\u2019s important that we practice social distancing and stay home as much as we can so that, while this virus continues to circulate, we\u2019re blunting [its spread] and decreasing the number of people who get sick at any one time,\u201d Peake said. \u201cThat\u2019s important both to protect people who could have more serious illness [from the virus] and so we\u2019re not overwhelming our health system,\u201d she said.","45":"RICHMOND \u2014 At Mary Washington Hospital in Fredericksburg, instead of cars, geriatric recliners and IV poles fill parking spots in the garage next to the emergency department \u2014 a makeshift field hospital for a possible overflow of patients. VCU Medical Center hurriedly packed up students\u2019 belongings last week to convert dorm rooms into a hospital for patients who do not have COVID-19 and free up beds in the main hospital for those who do. The medical center has asked the state for emergency permission to add 460 beds on various campuses. And on Wednesday, Gov. Ralph Northam ordered hospitals to cease non-urgent surgeries and made a call out to all medical professionals \u2014 from students to retirees \u2014 to volunteer for the state\u2019s Medical Reserve Corps to relieve anticipated medical staffing shortages. The state is also working with the Army Corps of Engineers to identify sites for building up hospital capacity. It\u2019s all part of an effort to keep Virginia\u2019s health care system from being overrun by COVID-19 patients like New York City and Italy before it. And while state officials say they are planning and encouraging social distancing to prevent the worst-case scenario, they have kept those plans mostly under wraps as some projections anticipate a shortage of intensive care beds, tens of thousands of sickened Virginians needing hospitalization and a climbing death toll in the coming months. v v v In Italy, doctors without enough ventilators \u2014 the machines that keep people with respiratory failure breathing \u2014 have decided who would live and who would die, often opting to save younger patients, according to news reports. In New York City, one hospital was using one ventilator for two patients, the New York Times reported Thursday, and New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo has tweeted that the state\u2019s 11,000 ventilators will fall far short of the 30,000 it expects to need. COVID-19 tests, masks and other protective equipment are also in short supply globally, putting health care workers in danger and making containing the virus especially difficult. On Friday, President Donald Trump invoked the Defense Production Act to compel General Motors to manufacture ventilators. The company said in a release that it is ramping up production and plans to work up to producing 10,000 per month. Still, experts who have projected how COVID-19 is likely to spread say the U.S. health care system will be strained in the coming days and weeks. Virginia, a state of more than 8.5 million people, has 2,000 ventilators on hand, according to Cotton Puryear, spokesman for the Virginia COVID-19 Unified Command Joint Information Center. The Virginia Department of Health referred questions from the Richmond Times-Dispatch on March 16 and March 24 to the joint information center, which is run by the Virginia Department of Emergency Management and includes spokespeople from different state agencies, which responded Friday. A middle-of-the-road projection that assumes 40% of the U.S. population will become infected with the coronavirus over the next six months predicts that hospital emergency rooms and critical care units would be overwhelmed, according to Dr. Ashish Jha, director of the Harvard Global Health Institute. \u201cEven when you have a lot of capacity creation, we would not be anywhere near where we need to be,\u201d Jha said on a webcast Thursday, referring to hospitals\u2019 actions like at VCU Health to free up space by canceling elective procedures and adding bed space. The state has requested an additional 350 ventilators from the national stockpile, but has not received an answer, Puryear said. \u201cIn addition to those assets, the regional health care coalitions that function as part of the Virginia Healthcare Emergency Management Program (VHEMP) have ventilators that can be deployed to hospitals,\u201d said Julian Walker, spokesman for the Virginia Hospitals and Healthcare Association, in a statement. \u201cWhile ventilator usage varies by region, at this point only a fraction of the ventilators in Virginia are in use to support patient care.\u201d While other state officials, like those in New York, have publicly discussed projections of how many intensive care beds and ventilators will be needed depending on how many people are infected by the virus, Virginia has not released that information. In news briefings, Northam and Health Secretary Daniel Carey have stopped short of giving specific numbers on current available resources or projections, instead saying that state officials are in the process of planning and urging the public to stay home and away from other people to slow the spread of the virus. \u201cYou need to stay at home,\u201d Northam said at a briefing Friday. \u201cThat is the only way that we can slow the spread of this virus to give our medical system time to build its capacity to save lives. \u2026 If we don\u2019t stay home \u2026 we will see our hospitals overwhelmed.\u201d State epidemiologist Dr. Lilian Peake said in an interview Friday that state officials are looking to different entities, such as the University of Virginia and individual hospital systems, that are doing scientific modeling to project possible numbers of infected people and needed resources, but that the state does not have one model it\u2019s relying on. Projections from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington in Seattle, which has done a state-by-state data analysis factoring in strict adherence to social distancing and public health measures, predict that Virginia will reach its peak in outbreak severity on May 2 and, on that day, will need 512 intensive care unit beds \u2014 183 more than the 329 they predict to be open \u2014 according to the data used by IHME. The projections also say Virginia will need 276 ventilators and can anticipate 1,543 COVID-19 deaths by Aug. 4. Loudoun County\u2019s Pandemic Response Plan, which was updated this month, says previous severe pandemic modeling used by the VDH estimated that Virginia could see 2,700 to 6,300 deaths, 12,000 to 28,500 hospitalizations and 1.08 million to 2.52 million people become sick. v v v At Friday\u2019s briefing, Carey addressed questions from reporters about bed capacity and projections, saying that state officials are aware of different projections and are involved in helping health systems implement their emergency plans and working to call in backup from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the Army Corps of Engineers and the Virginia National Guard. \u201cOur first and foremost goal is to encourage how to bend that curve so that those statistics and those potential realities don\u2019t come to pass,\u201d said Carey, reiterating the importance of social distancing. Kaiser Health News analyzed hospital bed data from fiscal years 2018 and 2019 throughout the U.S. and found that millions of Americans \u2014 and 7 million people over age 60 \u2014 live in counties or cities with no ICU beds. In Virginia, 76 of 133 localities reported having no ICU beds, but Kaiser noted the state\u2019s situation is more difficult to analyze because of its independent cities with hospitals that likely serve neighboring counties. KHN focused on older people because experts believe they \u2014 along with people who have chronic health conditions \u2014 are more susceptible to the severe and fatal cases of COVID-19, although the CDC has reported that nearly 40% of COVID-19 hospitalizations in the U.S. have been younger than 55. A Richmond Times-Dispatch analysis of KHN\u2019s data, dividing the state into eight regions instead of cities and counties, found that in Virginia, there were about 1,000 people who are 60 or older for every ICU bed in the state as of 2019. The Richmond area, which has the most beds, had about 770 seniors for every ICU bed. In Northern Virginia, which had the most reported coronavirus cases in the state as of Friday, there were about 1,250 seniors per ICU bed. Northern Virginia, the Richmond area and Hampton Roads accounted for more than 90% of confirmed coronavirus cases as of Friday. They skew younger than all other regions of the state and are home to about 70% of the state\u2019s ICU beds. About 1 in 5 people living in those three regions are 60 or older. Across the rest of the state, where a lower number of beds means a smaller outbreak could overwhelm the system, it\u2019s between 1 in 4 and 1 in 3. In James City County, which has the highest rate of infection in the state, 1 in 3 residents are 60 or older. The county is home to 26 ICU beds, according to the Kaiser data. As of Saturday\u2019s positive test count, Virginia had between two and three ICU beds for every diagnosed case of COVID-19. But in Northern Virginia, the 392 confirmed cases already slightly outnumber ICU beds in the region. Most people who test positive for COVID-19 do not require hospitalization, and even fewer require an ICU bed. The state health department reported that, as of Saturday, there had been 99 cumulative hospitalizations related to COVID-19 out of 739 confirmed cases. But Dr. Laurie Forlano, deputy commissioner for population health for the VDH, said in an interview that the department relies on hospitals to report hospitalizations. She said there tends to be a lag in reporting and \u2014 because it\u2019s cumulative \u2014 the number does not represent current hospitalizations. v v v The state also has shirked repeated questions about how it will approach offering guidance to hospitals on criteria for rationing health care should the need outstrip the supply, as it did in Italy and as it threatens to in New York. \u201cPart of the pandemic flu plan from years ago did anticipate the possibility of [the need for rationing]. We have taken that plan and we are in the midst of evaluating that,\u201d Carey said at the Friday briefing in response to a question about statewide rationing criteria. \u201cI would really focus on the most important thing we can do is \u2026 make sure we\u2019re doing everything we can to at least slow the spread of this disease. That\u2019s where our focus needs to be. At the same time, we are doing our contingency planning, and we are in the midst of that.\u201d Having a predetermined set of standards and state-level planning is vital when it comes to pandemic preparation, according to Mary Faith Marshall, director of the Program in Biomedical Ethics at UVa\u2019s School of Medicine and an expert in ethical issues during a pandemic. \u201cWhen you\u2019re doing pandemic planning, you always want to use the worst-case scenario,\u201d said Marshall, who helped the Minnesota Department of Health craft its resource scarcity plan a decade ago. Marshall said any rationing decisions should be made by multidisciplinary teams \u2014 not bedside health care practitioners \u2014 and those decisions should be free from discrimination and focused on the likelihood of the patient surviving at least a year. \u201cWhen you think about this criteria, you don\u2019t discriminate based on age, based on citizenship, for example, or necessarily disability,\u201d Marshall said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to know who the patient is.\u201d A National Academy of Medicine discussion paper published earlier this month laid out the steps health care providers should take before considering rationing equipment \u2014 such as a ventilator \u2014 including substituting, adapting or reusing equipment. The paper said that, if no other alternative exists, the equipment can be removed from one patient and given to another patient who is believed to have a higher chance of benefiting from the care. Marshall believes the leaders of Virginia\u2019s hospitals have been on top of preparing for the worst. \u201cPeople are just working around the clock,\u201d Marshall said. \u201cThey\u2019re putting their all into it.\u201d Another important part of the equation is transparency and accountability, according to Marshall and papers on the issue. \u201cThere is fear, there is anxiety and there is misinformation,\u201d Marshall said. \u201cGood communication is really important.\u201d","46":"With a governor\u2019s stay-at-home order in effect until June 10, local governments are continuing to switch their meetings to digital formats. Gov. Ralph Northam signed an order prohibiting gatherings of 10 or more people as cases of the coronavirus continue to rise. In following the governor\u2019s order, and to decrease the chance of spreading the virus, the Albemarle County Board of Supervisors announced that its 5 p.m. Wednesday meeting will be the first virtual one for the board. Residents who wish to observe the meeting may watch it at Albemarle.legistar.com. The livestream is for viewing only and will begin when the meeting starts. Those who wish to address the board may write a statement through albemarle.legistar.com by clicking on the e-comment tab up to a half-hour prior to the meeting. To livestream the meeting and make real-time comments, residents are encouraged to log in to the meeting through the Zoom conferencing platform. Zoom information and a speaker signup will be posted on albemarle.org\/bos for 24 hours prior to the meeting. Speakers are encouraged to sign up in advance of the meeting. The county also tweets the board\u2019s actions live on Twitter. Search for the county\u2019s account at @AlbemarleCounty. The Albemarle County School Board held a virtual meeting last week and has added to its schedule four COVID-19-related virtual meetings. The meetings begin Thursday and will provide members with updated information on the school division\u2019s COVID-19 management plan and any additional resources needed, as well as instructional support for students over the next two months. The plan is available at k12albemarle.org\/coronavirus. The division is completing its instructional plans for all students. Thursday\u2019s meeting will begin at 2 p.m. The public can virtually attend through the link at streaming.k12albemarle.org\/ACPS\/player.htm?xml\/schoolboard.xml. Also added to the School Board\u2019s schedule are virtual meetings on May 7, June 18 and July 16. All begin at 2 p.m. Community members can address board members on school division issues by email at schoolboard@k12albemarle.org or by postal mail at 401 McIntire Road, Charlottesville, VA 22902. Meanwhile, Greene County Public Schools has announced that all school facilities and the central office will be closed to the public effective immediately. Meals for students will continue to be available Mondays and Thursdays. UVa Medical Center On Monday, University of Virginia Medical Center spokesman Eric Swensen said, \u201cWe are caring for an increasing number of inpatients with COVID-19. We do continue to have capacity to care for patients. We are as prepared as a health system can be for an influx of patients.\u201d Swensen declined to say how many coronavirus patients are at the hospital, noting that the number fluctuates throughout the day. Madison Free Clinic The Madison Free Clinic has launched a telemedicine program for patients during the pandemic. The clinic\u2019s homebound patients may check in with their primary provider for follow-up appointments, virtual checkups, to refill prescriptions and other services. New and renewing patients can learn more by visiting madisonfreeclinic.org\/telemedicine. There is no charge for the service. Library closures The Jefferson-Madison Regional Library is extending its emergency closure until April 24, library officials announced Monday. In the meantime, library staff has set up a variety of online resources for patrons to use, including ebooks, audiobooks, eLearning and various databases. Temporary virtual cards to access these resources are available at www.jmrl.org. There are also a variety of virtual storytimes and daily boredom-buster challenges being posted on the library\u2019s social media channels. Staff will host a book club chat at 4 p.m. Tuesday on Jacqueline Woodson\u2019s \u201cBrown Girl Dreaming\u201d at jmrlblog.com. The library system also is extending its WiFi accessibility to its parking lots for public use and extending the due dates for all materials on hold. The extension will continue for several weeks after re-opening to give people a chance to collect the items. Sutherland committee Due to the governor\u2019s order, Albemarle County Public Schools announced Monday that it is suspending the name review committee\u2019s discussion of Sutherland Middle School. \u201cIt\u2019s our hope we will be able to resume our work, including the hosting of two community-wide public meetings, later this summer or in the early fall,\u201d Jasmine Fern\u00e1ndez, who is facilitating the work of the school community\u2019s advisory committee, said in a statement. \u201cRight now, our priority is to protect the safety and well-being of our students, staff and families.\u201d Sutherland\u2019s school name is being reviewed by the committee as part of a division-wide effort reexamining all 14 schools named for individuals. The first school to undergo a community review was Cale Elementary, which on July 1, will become Mountain View Elementary School. Sutherland\u2019s community advisory committee held its first meeting on March 2. It approved an online survey that sought recommendations from the public on names for their school for the committee\u2019s consideration. A March 20 public meeting to obtain comment on the names suggested in the survey was postponed in alignment with COVID-19 public health measures. PVCC veterans sessions Piedmont Virginia Community College has scheduled online information sessions for military students interested in using their Veterans Administration education benefits. The Veterans Education and Transition Services sessions are for students interested in signing up for summer or fall classes. The classes will be held via Zoom from 10 a.m. to noon Wednesdays between April 1 and April 29. The classes are free and feature assistance with the application process for admissions and educational benefits, military exceptions for residency requirements, financial aid, career services, disability services and credit for prior learning. Email Jackie Fisher at jfisher@pvcc.edu for specific instructions for web conferencing. Proliferation of scams On Monday, Sentara Health Care officials warned of a COVID-19 testing telephone scam circulating in Virginia Beach in which a caller was telling people that someone close to them had tested positive for the virus. The caller claimed to be from Sentara and offered to come to the home to perform the test. \u201cTo be clear, this caller has absolutely no association with Sentara. The resident was correctly suspicious, denied the request and contacted Sentara,\u201d corporate officials said in a statement. \u201cIf someone tries this tactic, deny the request and hang up. We are heartsick that in the midst of a national health crisis, scammers would use our name to prey on worried people.\u201d The Central Virginia Better Business Bureau, headquartered in Richmond, warned on Monday that several scams are targeting people working from home during the effort to thwart the coronavirus. \u201cGoing from an office setting to working at home, some may find themselves more vulnerable to tech support scams. Employees may attempt to solve technical issues themselves when confronted with pop-ups and virus alerts,\u201d said Leslie Blackwell, director of public affairs for the BBB. Blackwell said one person reportedly lost about $250 after a pop-up window appeared on the computer screen and the user\u2019s computer froze. Instructions in the pop-up window said to contact a company claiming to be affiliated with Apple and, after following the directions and paying to have the computer fixed, the tech support company disappeared. \u201cAnother concern for employees transitioning to a work-from-home environment is business email compromise scams,\u201d Blackwell said. \u201cScammers impersonate emails that appear to come directly from the boss. These fraudulent emails are often used to request payments to vendors via wire transfer.\u201d Blackwell said the scheme is not new, but that it is being modified to hook the work-at-home crowd. UVa Board of Visitors UVa\u2019s Board of Visitors discussed plans related to the university\u2019s response to the pandemic during a 50-minute closed emergency meeting Monday. Held over conference call, the meeting did not include any public discussion or comments from board members. UVa, like universities across the country, has shut down campus, sending students home, where they are continuing their classwork online.","47":"The woman was in her 80s; health officials said they will not provide any further information about her. As of Tuesday evening, the Thomas Jefferson Health District had 61 cases of COVID-19. Of those, 26 were in Albemarle County, 15 were in Charlottesville and 12 were in Louisa County. The district also covers Greene, Nelson and Fluvanna counties. When including Buckingham County, which is in the Piedmont Health District, and Madison County, which is in the Rappahannock Rapidan Health District, the total in Central Virginia has grown from four cases on March 19 to 65 cases. Reported confirmed cases in the area have included a University of Virginia employee; a UVa student; and an Albemarle County Police Department employee. Local nursing homes also have \u201cconfirmed the presence of COVID-19 in our community.\u201d \u201cWe are so sorry to hear of this loss of one of our community members. Our hearts go out to her family and friends,\u201d TJHD Health Director Denise Bonds said in a press release. \u201cIt is important that we all take this illness seriously and follow precautions to protect ourselves and those around us from illness. This is especially important for those at higher risk, like older adults and people with serious underlying health conditions.\u201d The woman\u2019s death is not yet counted in the Virginia Department of Health\u2019s tally of 27 people who have died in the state. THe statewide number also does not include two Richmond men who became the first people in that locality to die of COVID-19, according to the Richmond Times-Dispatch. As of Tuesday morning, 1,250 Virginians were confirmed to have contracted the virus.","48":"We were made for this!\u00a0 I have seen this spoken on social media a dozen times in the new, self-quarantined world we now occupy, in reference to the sea change in how we teach. As in, \u201cIntroverts. Germaphobes. Quilters! We were made for this!\u201d But what about doctors and nurses who heal and comfort? Teachers who ignite their students\u2019 minds across a classroom\u2019s expanse? Collaborators who need one another to fuel their creativity? A few weeks in, it may not feel like we\u2019re made for this, but I think, in fact, we \u2014 the collective we \u2014 really are. We educators are motivated. And if there were ever a time to step up and solve problems and find creative solutions, it is now. People are depending on us, and the virtual communities we establish must foster creativity, innovation, and stamina. As we convene in Zoom meetings and chat rooms, we\u2019re finding our way together. We lead from our home offices, couches, and dining room tables. We do it with pajama bottoms on, sipping from mugs in our kitchens, and we leave meetings to let the dog out. We do our best to be steady, as we realize the incredible value of this virtual community at a time when we are more physically apart than we ever imagined we could be and find ourselves in a new moment in how we teach, connect, and learn.\u00a0 So what\u2019s the secret sauce of the best virtual spaces? In my world of nursing and medical students, who stand at the precipice of professions that are at the frontlines of this pandemic, it\u2019s positivity. Do you remember, pre-COVID-19, how you looked forward to some meetings and dreaded others? We look forward to meetings that are productive and positive, and groan over those that are too long, are dominated by one or two people, or produce no visible results. What constituted a good meeting then? Laughter? Jokes? Progress?\u00a0 It\u2019s the same now. Online, we can be just as productive, so long as we use positivity to bridge the virtual gaps we might anticipate. Here\u2019s how: \u00bb We must maximize introductions. As COVID-19 twists our work into pretzels, many of us are meeting with new colleagues and lean on Zoom\u2019s name feature. (By the way, can we keep this when the crisis ends? Names on our foreheads, perhaps?) Use introductions to celebrate one another, even if it makes you chuckle doing it. \u201cWelcome, Kathy!\u201d Everyone applauds. \u00bb Share \u201cAppreciative Chickens.\u201d At the Center for Appreciative Practice at the University of Virginia where I work, we begin meetings with \u201cappreciative check-ins\u201d \u2014 or did until a colleague mis-typed the moniker as \u201cappreciative chicken.\u201d We embraced it. Appreciative chickens are opportunities to share anything that recently brought joy. Your mention of the coming of spring makes me see the tulips; when I share a thank-you email, it prompts you to think of your child. It doesn\u2019t have to be a monumental chicken; just a human one. \u00bb Ask unconditionally positive questions. A friend told me a COVID-19 best practice story when her colleague asked everyone: \u201cWhat are you doing to build community in your current situation?\u201d Not, \u201cWhat challenges or issues are you facing?\u201d Start with an up note. Try hard to keep it there. \u00bb Acknowledge and reframe the pandemic. COVID-19 is out there, and we\u2019re unsure what lies ahead. But we can encourage each other to also look to the remarkableness that lives in the corners of every crisis. That shifts our focus to one another\u2019s resilience, good humor, and more. It\u2019s also an invitation to creatively step up our teaching game. If you struggle with the novelty of meeting online, consider some benefits of online gatherings. I love seeing colleagues\u2019 homes and meeting students\u2019 pets. I love wearing comfy pants all day. I\u2019ll ask my students to upload their favorite vacation spot to their virtual background for class. A friend of mine recently called social distancing a \u201cgift of time.\u201d It won\u2019t last forever, so what will we do with the gift? And how will we, heaven help us, connect? We\u2019re doing it already. And if we teachers and academics view online communities and platforms not as chilly expanses of internet ether but as sunny places to connect, we\u2019ve won half the battle. Our students will see us and feel that they, too, can plot forward, that they, too, can find ways to embrace this new, albeit temporary, reality. Maybe even relish it a little. A colleague of mine told me her kids got in on a recent Zoom meeting and told knock-knock jokes to her colleagues, and that her daughter later fell asleep in her lap while she facilitated a brainstorming session. It was hard to type, she said, as the child snored, but she got it done. \u201cI need grace,\u201d she typed in an email to me later, \u201cbecause I am human and my kids need me right now, too.\u201d Yes, we are humans in need of so much grace, but with so much grace to give. We will lead from our couches and construct virtual environments where grace and communities thrive.\u00a0","49":"\u201cThe employee is recovering and under care of their primary care physician. No further cases of COVID-19 have been diagnosed within the department,\u201d said county spokeswoman Emily Kilroy. Police announced the officer\u2019s test on March 20 via social media and asked citizens to stay at home and keep a safe distance from each other, about six or seven feet, also known as social distancing. They took that time to announce that officers would take more precautions when needed during service calls. Local officials and organizations continued advising area residents about the impact of the coronavirus Wednesday, from warning against scams to announcing more donations of personal protective equipment for local health care workers. Slight bump in area cases The Thomas Jefferson Health District reported 63 positive cases of COVID-19 on Wednesday, a slight increase from Tuesday. The health district reported district-wide demographic data and hospitalization information for the first time. A majority of the positive COVID-19 cases in the district are among people under 60 years old, according to officials. Of the positive cases, 19 people have been hospitalized and one person has died. Albemarle County has the most cases within the district at 28, which includes four clinically diagnosed cases. \u201cClinically diagnosed\u201d means individuals haven\u2019t been tested but are close contacts to someone who has tested positive and is experiencing symptoms. Forty-one of the cases are people under 60 years old, 22 are people over 60 years old and 37 women and 26 men have tested positive. Cases by localities \u2014 Albemarle: 28 (includes 4 clinically diagnosed) Charlottesville: 16 (includes 1 clinically diagnosed) Fluvanna: 4 Greene: 1 Louisa: 12 Nelson: 2 ACSA warns of scams Albemarle County Service Authority officials warned on Wednesday that scam artists are preying upon people with concerns about the COVID-19 pandemic. \u201c[We] want to immediately warn our customers about a variety of scams related to their customer accounts and the quality of their drinking water,\u201d Executive Director Gary O\u2019Connell said in a statement. \u201cScammers are contacting customers by phone saying they are from the ACSA and stating that if the customer doesn\u2019t immediately pay their bill, the water will be shut off,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have also heard from other utilities that scammers are going door-to-door to demand instant payment or else water will be shut off.\u201d O\u2019Connell said that won\u2019t happen. \u201cACSA customer service staff does not take credit or debit card payments over the phone, does not go door-to-door to collect payment from customers,\u201d he said. \u201cIn response to the COVID-19 outbreak, the ACSA has stopped conducting shutoffs for non-payment of past due accounts.\u201d O\u2019Connell said some scammers are trying to sell customers water filters. That is unnecessary, he said. Conventional water treatment already removes or inactivates the virus. CFAI donates masks Charlottesville\u2019s CFA Institute, the world\u2019s largest association of investment management professionals, is giving 2,800 N95 masks to local first responders and healthcare workers. Officials said Wednesday they would give 1,000 masks to the Charlottesville Albemarle Rescue Squad, 1,000 masks to Albemarle County Fire and Rescue, and 800 masks to the Hospice of the Piedmont, which is currently serving COVID-19 patients. The donation comes as health care professionals across the country struggle with a shortage of personal protective equipment, including N95 respirators. CFA officials said the organization has traditionally provided the personal protective equipment for its employees traveling internationally. As medical supplies have run low, health professionals have looked for alternate sources for protective equipment. \u201cWe care deeply about the well-being of this community,\u201d said Kelli Palmer, the institute\u2019s head of global inclusion, diversity and corporate citizenship, in a statement. \u201cWe believe that we are all stronger when we work together, and we must all must do our part during these challenging times.\u201d Aid for city businesses Also on Wednesday, Charlottesville city economic development officials announced several new grant and loan programs to help businesses that are being hurt by stay-at-home orders during the COVID-19 pandemic. \u201cThese efforts are meant to help alleviate the immediate effects that closures and reduced operations are having on city businesses,\u201d Economic Director Chris Engel said in a statement. \u201cCity businesses are eligible to apply for more than one program and can apply for these in addition to the Small Business Administration\u2019s economic injury disaster loans and $10,000 emergency grant.\u201d City programs include up to $2,000 in grants for businesses in the city and loans up to $5,000 for socially disadvantaged city businesses that have encountered racial or ethnic prejudice or cultural bias, and other grants. More information can be found at charlottesville.org\/econdev. Ting WiFi at IX Park Ting Internet said Wednesday that it is working to create drive-up free Internet access points in Charlottesville. The first Ting Internet Charlottesville \u201cPark and Wi-Fi\u201d spot is located at IX Park., the company said in a news release. WiFi access will be available between 7:00 a.m. and 8:00 p.m., seven days a week. Users are asked to stay in their vehicles, minimize social interaction and follow health officials\u2019 recommended social distancing protocol. Albemarle court clerk\u2019s office to close The Albemarle County Circuit Clerk\u2019s Office will revise its service hours and close its office to the public, apart from appointment, per an order issued Wednesday by Judge Cheryl Higgins. According to a news release from the county clerk\u2019s office, appointments can be scheduled during customer service hours, which run from 8:30 a.m. to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. Customers must call ahead at (434) 972-4083 to schedule appointments for all in-person services. More information about changes to marriage, deeds, permits and estate matters can be found on the county\u2019s website at albemarle.org\/department.asp? department=circuitcourt. Additionally, docket call on April 6 has been continued and all matters for that day have been moved to the June term. Alterations to court operations are expected to last at least until April 26 and are subject to change. PVCC, UVa adjustments Piedmont Virginia Community College announced that it has set virtual information sessions for prospective students interested in degree and certificate programs. The sessions will also provide information on student services and other resources to help students get started at PVCC. The online information sessions are free and open to the public. Pre-registration is required. To participate and view April session dates, sign up at pvcc.edu\/outreach or call (434) 961-5275. Earlier this week, UVa canceled in-person summer programs through June 30, and would move June session classes online. The announcement came after Gov. Ralph Northam extended a stay-at-home order through June 10. By June 1, the university will decide about in-person summer programs occurring after July 1, officials said.","50":"Several floors within the new gleaming six-story tower at the University of Virginia Medical Center will come online sooner than expected as hospital officials plan for an increase in patients related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The first group of additional beds in the tower will be available later this week, said Eric Swensen, a spokesman for the hospital. UVa has set up a COVID-19 clinic to screen potential cases of the novel coronavirus, and said recently it is seeing an increasing number of inpatients with the virus, though it declined to give exact numbers. As of press time, medical center officials don\u2019t have plans to establish temporary or field hospitals, something Gov. Northam has said he is exploring at a statewide level. \u201cWe have developed multiple scenarios for having sufficient staff and beds to provide care, including ICU care, if we were to see an influx of patients that required inpatient care for coronavirus,\u201d Swensen said. The hospital started construction on the $394 million tower in 2016. An expanded emergency department on the first floor opened in October. The top four floors of the building contain private patient rooms, which were scheduled to open gradually starting this summer. The medical center plans to use more beds as needed in the new tower over the next six to eight weeks. Before the new emergency department opened in 2019, the hospital had 612 beds. To ensure the medical center has sufficient staffing and resources, staff members have rescheduled elective surgeries as well as all clinic visits with the exception of urgent care and sick visits through at least April 13. \u201cWe are putting team members through additional training to be prepared to take care of patients with COVID-19,\u201d Swensen said in a statement. \u201cThe university is actively reviewing opportunities to repurpose unused space.\u201d As of Wednesday afternoon, one person has died from the virus, 63 people have tested positive in the Thomas Jefferson Health District. The first case was reported in the health district three weeks ago. Health officials did not release information about the woman who died and it is unclear if she died at home or in a hospital. Statewide, 165 people have been hospitalized, according to the Virginia Department of Health, and 19 have been within the district. Nationally, 13.8% percent of cases have resulted in someone needing hospital care, according to the COVID Tracking Project. Other hospitals throughout Virginia are setting up hospitals in parking lots and converting dorms to prepare for a rise in patients, according to the Richmond Times-Dispatch. Northam has asked the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to evaluate sites across the state from potential field hospitals, and they looked at 41 locations. The list was narrowed to three sites in Fairfax, Hampton Roads and Richmond, Northam said during a press conference Wednesday. Virginia has enough hospital beds for the crisis, according to projections from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington in Seattle. However, the state is short 589 Intensive Care Unit beds, according to estimates. Between Martha Jefferson and UVa, Charlottesville and Albemarle County have 37 ICU beds, according to an analysis by Kaiser Health News, though UVa\u2019s website notes a larger number of intensive care beds dedicated to specialities such as pediatric care and cardiovascular care. UVa, one of six Level 1 trauma centers in the state, serves communities throughout central and south-central Virginia. Northam and other state officials have said the key to making sure hospitals aren\u2019t overwhelmed is for people to stay home. On Monday, he ordered people to stay at their homes except for essential travel. Jennifer Downs, a spokeswoman for Sentara Martha Jefferson, said in a statement that hospital staff are monitoring how they can leverage the resources within Sentara\u2019s 12-hospital system as the situation unfolds. The hospital has 176 beds, according to its website. \u201cSentara Martha Jefferson has worked to identify additional areas within our hospital where we could care for patients, should it become necessary,\u201d Downs said. \u201cAdditionally, we have active plans in place surrounding meeting the staffing needs we could be faced with as well.\u201d","51":"When the pandemic came to the country\u2019s shores, University of Virginia Medical School researchers studying the life cycles of various viruses dropped their cultures and switched gears. UVa laboratory leaders, building upon studies by researchers across the world, are working on possible vaccines, screening existing drugs for efficacy and studying the use of antibodies in fighting SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus that causes the COVID-19 disease that has swept the globe. \u201cA lot of our research is on emerging infectious diseases, like different strains of influenza,\u201d said Dr. Paul Kasson, who conducts virus research at the medical school. \u201cWe think of [influenza] as an old disease, but it\u2019s the case model for infectious respiratory diseases. We had a lot of information and research that could be applied to [SARS-CoV-2].\u201d Kasson, Dr. William Petri and Dr. Steven Zeichner are among university researchers who moved their research from one virus to another. \u201cWe saw that COVID-19 was going to be a big deal and thought we should get a head start on that,\u201d Kasson recalled. \u201cWe started preparatory work to switch over in late January. It changed for us what we were doing specifically but the ideas and the approach we use in fighting influenza apply to this.\u201d Zeichner, who has been studying potential treatments and vaccines for HIV, has adapted research models to address the new coronavirus. \u201cSince it was such an imperative problem and we had a window where we could move over and apply our research to it, we thought we had an obligation to do so,\u201d Zeichner said. Using the results of others to model the new virus, Zeichner said he and his colleagues saw some similarities in the protein structures of HIV and SARS-CoV-2. The proteins, while structured differently, are used by both viruses to commandeer cells and replicate. Like other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 particles are spherical and have spiked proteins that stick out from their surfaces; the spikes latch onto human cells, allowing the viral membrane to fuse with the cell membrane and create copies of the virus. His group\u2019s research into vaccines and anti-viral drugs for HIV now is being applied to the novel coronavirus \u201cWe know a lot about the virus. We know its structure. Researchers in China got the structure very fast and put it online in a matter of six weeks,\u201d Zeichner said. \u201cIf you have the sequence of the virus, you can do a lot.\u201d \u201cEveryone in the world is working on this and we\u2019re learning a lot about the virus as we go,\u201d Kasson said. \u201cWe started out with informed guesses and as we sequence it and gain more data, some of those guesses are supported and some aren\u2019t. That seems to change a bit every day as more research is being done and shared. We have to keep in mind the difference between our best guesses and those things we learn for sure.\u201d Research is designed to prove and disprove best guesses and the university\u2019s medical school has a strong research game. Last fiscal year its research teams snagged a record $146.3 million in funding from the National Institutes of Health. The funding has put dollars behind ambitious research efforts to pioneer new treatments, such as an artificial pancreas developed at UVa, as well as delving into the mysteries of what causes diseases and how to treat or cure them. University officials credited the talent and abilities of staff and faculty for earning the grants. \u201cThe NIH is the nation\u2019s single greatest resource for funding of bio-medical research and the quantity of grants is relative to the quality of the research programs,\u201d said Dr. David S. Wilkes, dean of the medical school. \u201cThe grants are incredibly competitive to get. They want to know the work that researchers propose is likely to succeed. We\u2019re at a record level of funding and that\u2019s a testament to the abilities of our faculty and the quality of their work.\u201d NIH funding has helped UVa pioneer using focused soundwaves rather than scalpels in surgery, develop new cancer treatments and the recent milestone of an artificial pancreas to assist those with Type 1 diabetes. On March 25, the NIH issued an emergency competitive revision to existing NIH awards to allow researchers to refocus on the current pandemic. The NIH \u201cis particularly interested in projects focusing on viral natural history, pathogenicity, transmission, as well as projects developing medical countermeasures and suitable animal models for pre-clinical testing of vaccines and therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2\/COVID-19,\u201d the revision states. \u201cTransmission characteristics and the associated morbidity and mortality are not completely understood, but there is clear evidence of human-to-human transmission,\u201d the revision notice states. \u201cMany other aspects of viral pathogenesis, natural history and host range are poorly understood. Given this, there is an urgent public health need to better understand SARS-CoV-2\/COVID-19.\u201d Although SARS-CoV-2 and HIV are completely different types of viruses, the fact that both utilize a particular protein to access host cells and replicate gives researchers a leg-up on the illness. \u201cIf we take our research into HIV and can see similar structures in this virus, that gives us some options to work on based on our previous research,\u201d Zeichner said. \u201cWe\u2019re working with other labs across the state. People are working hard.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re looking at what can be done in the short term as far as treating symptoms and anti-virals, but also in the long term as far as creating vaccines,\u201d Kasson said. \u201cThere has been a lot of research on SARS and MERS, which have some similarities to SARS-CoV-2. There\u2019s a lot of ground work out there. Some of it will apply to this situation and some of it won\u2019t. There\u2019s a lot of information to work off of.\u201d \u201cThere have been other problematic coronaviruses so there is a lot known about some particulars,\u201d Zeichner agreed. \u201cPeople are working hard everywhere. I feel lucky working for the university because, even though they have shut down much of the research that normally goes on due to social distancing requirements, they\u2019ve agreed to keep some of the larger machinery operating so we may use some important equipment we need.\u201d \u201cThe hope is with all of the capability we have in the country we could come up with ways to help control the spread and come up with better treatments,\u201d Kasson said. \u201cThe long game is better anti-virals and an effective vaccine. That\u2019s what we\u2019re working toward.\u201d","52":"The University of Virginia is providing clinical trials for a potential medication for COVID-19. UVa announced that it is joining a national clinical trial for remdesivir on Thursday. Trial data will be gathered from an estimated 440 participants worldwide. The novel coronavirus, which causes the disease COVID-19, currently has no proven treatments or vaccines, though several are in early stages of testing. In an online town hall Thursday morning, officials said UVa is examining options to support contract workers laid off after dining halls and support services closed; is not planning to refund all fees for students but is issuing some credits; and is looking into providing housing for first responders in now-empty residence halls. Dr. K. Craig Kent, executive vice president for health affairs at UVa, said during the town hall that UVa and Sentara Martha Jefferson Hospital are treating about 25 patients for COVID-19; on Wednesday, the Thomas Jefferson Health District for the first time released local hospitalization numbers, with a total of 19 at that time. UVa is opening its new tower earlier than planned in case capacity is needed for more treatment. Hospitalized patients with COVID-19 who are showing significant symptoms can choose to participate in the remdesivir trial. Significant symptoms include difficulty breathing, using supplemental oxygen or needing a ventilator. Remdesivir is an antiviral drug that has been tested in humans with the Ebola virus. It has \u201cshown promise\u201d in animal studies against Middle East respiratory syndrome and severe acute respiratory syndrome, which are caused by different types of coronavirus, according to the university. \u201cFinding an effective treatment will be incredibly important in our battle against COVID-19,\u201d Kent said. Trial participants will be randomly assigned to either receive remdesivir or a placebo intravenously for up to 10 days, according to the university. Participants and doctors will not know whether the patient is receiving the medication or placebo. Patients will continue to receive the standard of care for their symptoms. \u201cHaving scientifically sound information about the effectiveness of remdesivir will be helpful as we seek to provide the best care for patients,\u201d Dr. Patrick Jackson, principal investigator for the trial at UVa, said in a news release about the trial. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, which is part of the National Institutes of Health, is funding the study. Gilead Sciences Inc., which developed remdesivir, is supplying it for the study. During the town hall, Kent also said that at least 90 UVa employees have been quarantined because they\u2019ve contracted COVID-19 or have come into contact with it. A spokesman for the hospital later clarified that 94 health system employees are on temporary leave without pay, out of a workforce of several thousand. President Jim Ryan said that the university has plans to provide housing for first responders and hospital workers who may not be able to quarantine or self-isolate at their own homes, but he did not provide additional specifics. In his remarks, Ryan also noted that Asian American students and faculty have been targeted by xenophobic attacks in recent weeks. \u201cThis is both intolerable and reprehensible,\u201d he said. Across the country, Asian Americans are reporting verbal and physical attacks as the virus has spread, according to The New York Times. Until recently, President Donald Trump referred to it as the \u201cChina virus,\u201d despite public health officials\u2019 emphases that diseases have no ethnicity and that such monikers can encourage discrimination. Contract employees UVa Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer J.J. Davis told those listening that many of the university\u2019s contractors have furloughed employees, particularly Aramark, which provides dining services. \u201cObviously, this is disappointing to all of us,\u201d she said. While the university is not providing direct aid to contractors, it has asked companies to structure the furloughs in a way that allows employees to take advantage of expanded state and federal unemployment relief, Davis said. Aramark has expanded its benefits for workers by adding sick leave and has a drive-thru meal program five days a week for furloughed employees, Davis said. Financial impacts Ryan said university officials are crafting plans to mitigate the financial impact of the university\u2019s shutdown. \u201cThere\u2019s little doubt that we will be facing critical financial decisions in the coming weeks and months,\u201d he said. Davis said UVa is creating short-term plans to cut costs. Ryan added that faculty and staff will remain on the payroll and employment contracts will be honored \u201cfor the foreseeable future.\u201d He said payroll has been \u201cmade more difficult\u201d because the recently approved federal aid package did not send money to employers to keep their workers on the payroll. \u201cWhat we\u2019re facing is really difficult and it\u2019s going to require all of us working together to confront it,\u201d he said. Ryan said the university\u2019s \u201csincere hope\u201d is to be open and running for the fall semester, \u201cbut it\u2019s too soon to tell\u201d whether that will be possible. Officials are determining a final date to make a decision about the next semester. \u201cOur main goal has been to keep our university operating,\u201d he said. UVa began issuing credits and refunds to students for their housing and dining costs this week. Provost Liz Magill said it\u2019s too early to know how the virus will affect university enrollment, but noted that 21% of students are international and may be affected by current travel restrictions. Most of those students are in post-graduate programs. Guard student Magill also responded to recent reports that a student in UVa\u2019s law school is being asked to pull out of school because their National Guard unit was called to fight the coronavirus in New York. \u201cI know firsthand that is not correct,\u201d she said. Magill said many students and faculty are in reserve forces and some have been called up due to the virus. She said that a rule in graduate programs does not allow students to be full-time students and have a full-time job. Magill said the student is in the process of filing a waiver to the rule, which is the same approach taken in other situations.","53":"Jason Haddock, a district sales manager at Sysco Virginia, said he estimates that Sysco has given food to more than 400 people over the last few days. \u201cWe started on Tuesday and we just let people kind of shop on their own, just come in and fill bags up and it was just pretty chaotic,\u201d he said. \u201cToday we did things a little differently \u2014 we packed bags for people and we\u2019re able to hand them out really quickly.\u201d The food distribution company is calling the project the Catering Outfit Helps Food Pantry, and also is working with Digital Minerva, Pale Fire Brewing and York Property. According to Virginia Employment Commission weekly initial claims for unemployment insurance, more than 3,100 people in Charlottesville and Albemarle County filed unemployment claims between March 8 and March 28. \u201cA number of counties and cities continued to cite COVID-19-related layoffs, with many areas reporting increased layoffs in service-related industries broadly and in the accommodation and food services industries in particular,\u201d the VEC said in a news release. \u201cHowever, there are indications that layoffs are broadening to affect a wider range of industries.\u201d Alexandria Herndon, who was laid off from her jobs as a server at Burtons Grill & Bar and Sedona Taphouse, said Burtons has tried to recommend resources for its employees but that it\u2019s definitely helpful to be able to come get food. \u201cI filed for unemployment, but the only thing that\u2019s really saving me at this point is that before serving, I was a banker, so all the money I\u2019ve paid into that is the only thing that\u2019s helping me,\u201d she said. \u201cI have plenty of friends who serve and they\u2019re barely getting $150 a week, but you could easily make that in one night serving, so it\u2019s definitely a big difference.\u201d Karen B., who requested her full name be withheld, was a server part-time at two different restaurants and also is a writer and yoga instructor. She said she has been sheltering in place with close friends outside of Charlottesville. \u201cWe\u2019re pooling our resources to get through this out of town,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re also restaurant industry people.\u201d Haddock said they will be giving out groceries again on Friday and will continue to do so until they run out of food. \u201cNow, we\u2019re asking for the community to try to help step in a little bit to provide donations of dry goods,\u201d he said. Courtney Hildebrand, director of sales and catering for The Catering Outfit, said the effort so far has received donations from a nurse, two community members who filled their cars with groceries and Kappa Kappa Gamma at the University of Virginia. \u201cWe are still accepting donations from the community as much as possible to keep this going as long as possible, and it might be less frequent pop-up dates as we collect stuff and then have enough to do another date,\u201d she said. Anyone interested in donating can email food@cateringoutfit.com. Westminster-Canterbury As of 3 p.m. Thursday, the Thomas Jefferson Health District said it had 68 test-confirmed or clinically diagnosed cases. The highest number of cases in the district is in Albemarle County, according to the TJHD, with 28 confirmed cases and four clinically diagnosed cases. Senior living community Westminster-Canterbury of the Blue Ridge said Thursday that a resident has been diagnosed as having COVID-19. A news release said the facility was informed Wednesday evening and that the resident is now being cared for in isolation at the facility\u2019s health center. Staff \u201cconsidered to be at high risk of exposure\u201d will be sent home to self-quarantine for 14 days, according to the facility, and residents will continue to shelter in place. If people show symptoms of COVID-19, they will be tested. Westminster-Canterbury is the third senior care facility in the Charlottesville area known to be affected by the virus \u2014 The Lodge at Old Trail and The Colonnades also each have had a positive case of COVID-19. The facilities had not publicly said whether additional residents have tested positive or have been tested as of press time Thursday. Affordable housing On Thursday, Charlottesville received $246,699 for affordable housing out of the federal coronavirus relief package. Virginia\u2019s U.S. senators, Mark R. Warner and Tim Kaine, announced the funding among $52.3 million that will be doled out throughout the state. Charlottesville received funding under the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development\u2019s Community Development Block Grant. The program provides money to create housing or expand economic opportunities for low- and moderate-income people. City spokesman Brian Wheeler said the funds aren\u2019t tied to a specific project and staff will provide a recommendation to the City Council on how to spend the money. According to federal guidelines, the money can be used for buildings and improvements, assistance to businesses and certain public services.","54":"This live blog will be updated with many recent developments.

Thursday, March 26 updates The University's of Virginia's fundraising page has been updated with an option to contribute to a fund for students experiencing financial hardship due to COVID-19. The \"Student Life and Leadership Fund\" is a longstanding rainy day fund for students hit with unexpected expenses, according to the university. UVa's Student Council also has set up a fund for students.  Researchers at the University of Virginia\u2019s Biocomplexity Institute have won a new $10 million, five-year \u201cExpeditions in Computing\u201d grant from the National Science Foundation to use innovative technological and scientific advancements to plan for, and respond to, epidemics and pandemics. The effort, which includes epidemiologists at UVa as well as at Stanford University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Princeton University, Virginia Tech and two national laboratories, is working with local, regional, national and international public health agencies and universities to apply and deploy new technologies \u2013 many developed at the UVa Biocomplexity Institute \u2013 to predict and manage current and future epidemics. The project is designed to improve epidemic planning and response by providing computational tools to epidemiologists worldwide; increasing surveillance of disease-spreading conditions; using weather and climate forecasting to likewise forecast epidemics; provide planning tools to policymakers to help in the allocation of resources such as vaccines and ventilators; and studying how social and political structures affect disease progression.  Wednesday, March 25 updates A 4 p.m. update from the Thomas Jefferson Health District noted 22 lab confirmed cases of COVID-19 as well as three clinically diagnosed cases in the following list of localities: Albemarle - 9 Charlottesville -7 Fluvanna - 3 Greene - 0 Louisa - 4 Nelson - 1 Unknown (still determining address) - 1  The National Park Service Wednesday afternoon said it would close the popular Shenandoah National Park loops at Old Rag and Whiteoak Canyon due to overcrowding. The amount of motorists and hikers have made it difficult to follow social distancing guidelines, the service said.\u00a0 For more information about other changes in the park, go to the service's website. Other popular hikes in the Blue Ridge have been closing due to similar concerns. Check signs and postings before you go.  Tuesday, March 24 The Thomas Jefferson Health District on Tuesday confirmed 14 presumptive positive cases in the district. There are three cases in the city of Charlottesville; six cases in Albemarle County; three cases in Louisa County; one case in Nelson County and one case in Fluvanna County, officials said. There are also two clinically diagnosed cases. One is in Charlottesville and one lives outside of the district but has had close contact with a confirmed positive person in the district, officials said. Clinically diagnosed cases are individuals who are not tested because they are very close contacts (like a spouse) to someone who is lab-confirmed COVID-19 positive and are experiencing symptoms. Due to their level of exposure and symptoms, the Virginia Department of Health considers clinically diagnosed cases positive without a COVID-19 lab test, the district said -- For example, a clinically diagnosed case could be the spouse of a lab confirmed COVID-19 case.  Monday, March 23 Area grocery stores are now implementing senior hours, allowing senior citizens to get in and out of stores quickly.

Gov. Ralph Northam has ordered schools to close for at least two weeks until March 27 in order to slow the spread of COVID-19. The county schools\u2019 decision to keep schools closed longer comes as states and communities are taking drastic steps to prevent the virus from spreading further and the Virginia Department of Education announced it was looking to cancel state SOL testing. The Centers of Disease Control and Prevention said late last week that closing schools for two weeks wouldn\u2019t have much impact on containing a virus. \u201cWe are continuing to closely monitor developments on the spread of COVID-19 and the most current health and safety guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and from the state Department of Health,\u201d Superintendent Matt Haas said in a news release. \u201cBased upon that information, it is clear that public meeting restrictions will not be lifted in the near future.\u201d Charlottesville City Schools has said it will be closed at least until March 27 and is following the governor\u2019s guidance about school closures. Haas said in the release that he is extending the closure to assist with the school division\u2019s planning on how to continue to deliver services to students and families at home and to provide as much advance notice to parents as possible so that they have as much time as possible to make necessary child care arrangements. The division\u2019s spring break is scheduled to begin April 3. Haas told students that teachers will be reaching out about ways they can stay engaged with learning and shared a webpage with resources. The division also has extended its Wi-Fi access to the school parkings lots for students to use. In a message to students, Haas said he too was disappointed that spring school activities have been canceled or put on hold. \u201cI am sorry about that, and I hope we will have a chance to make it up to you,\u201d he wrote. He also encouraged students to write an email or card to a family member and friend and to get outside. \u201cIf you don\u2019t already keep a journal, this time is a great opportunity to start one,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAs I told a student last week, coronavirus now is a part of your life\u2019s story and of our history.\u201d  Graduation ceremonies for Virginia\u2019s community colleges, including Piedmont Virginia Community College, are canceled, Glenn DuBois, chancellor of the community college system, announced Tuesday. DuBois made the decision following a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendation to cancel or postpone gatherings of 50 or more people over the next eight weeks, a guideline Gov. Ralph Northam echoed Tuesday morning when he said the state would ban gatherings of more than 10 people. DuBois wrote in a letter that the colleges will honor the achievements of graduating students later when it it safe for students, families, faculty and staff. \u201cWhat\u2019s difficult is that the very things that make these ceremonies meaningful also make them dangerous in this pandemic,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWhile it\u2019s a celebration of individual achievements, it\u2019s a community celebration. Many of the same family members who travel far and wide to attend are at particularly high risk with this virus. And the hugs and high-fives that come naturally to so many of us in that moment fly in the face of the social distancing practices we are asked to observe.\u201d PVCC decided last week to switch to online courses. UVa has said it will make a decision about graduation ceremonies by April 15.  At the Charlottesville-Albemarle SPCA, staff members are still going to work but visitors are only allowed by appointment to limit the number of people entering the premises. The SPCA rummage store is closing for the next two weeks, effective Tuesday, and public spay\/neuter services have been suspended, according to the organization \u201cMany people have reached out asking how they can help the animals in our care,\u201d said Angie Gunter, chief executive office of the CASPCA, in a news release. \u201cThe most urgent need at the Charlottesville-Albemarle SPCA is for animals to get out through adoption or foster.\u201d The organization highlighted a World Health Organization statement that there is no evidence that dogs, cats or other companion animals spread the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19. \u201cWe hope that people will make an appointment to adopt or foster a pet to spend time with while they're at home,\u201d Gunter said. For more information on adopting or fostering, go to\u00a0http:\/\/caspca.org\/.  The Jefferson Area Board for Aging is suspending operations at its community senior centers and the Charlottesville Adult Care Center as well as closing its Charlottesville office to visitors. The senior centers are stopping operations Tuesday along with meal operations. The adult care center will stop operations Friday.

Local Social Security offices, including the Charlottesville office in Pantops, will be closed starting Tuesday, but staff members will be available over the phone. \u201cThis decision protects the population we serve\u2014older Americans and people with underlying medical conditions\u2014and our employees during the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic,\u201d officials with the Social Security Administration wrote in a news release. \u201cHowever, we are still able to provide critical services.\u201d For Social Security services, individuals can go online at socialsecurity.gov\/onlineservices to apply for retirement, disability or other benefits and find more information. The local offices will be still conducting business over the phone. The administration's field office locator has information on how to get into touch with local staff members. Calls might come from a private number, and the news release notes that Social Security employees will not threaten individuals or ask for any form of payment.  Starting Wednesday, Charlottesville Area Transit\u2019s Downtown Transit Station will reduce its hours of operation in response to the COVID-19 outbreak. CAT buses will continue to run their regular routes, though CAT staff are using CDC-approved cleaning materials to disinfect all high-touch areas on buses and in facilities. The downtown station will be open from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Friday. For more updates, go to www.catchthecat.org.

Gay Perez, UVa\u2019s assistant vice president of student affairs, notified students who are still living in Bice House, Bond House and the Language Houses of the plan in an email that was provided to The Daily Progress. UVa President Jim Ryan said the university was considering using empty dorms for first responder housing during a town hall Thursday, but didn\u2019t provide specifics at that time. According to the university, 23 students received an email that said they would be relocated to Copeley or Lambeth apartments. They were given the option to move out if they didn\u2019t want to relocate. University spokesman Wes Hester said three students have chosen to leave. Most of the students are being relocated to empty apartments, but some will be moved into units that still contain others\u2019 belongings. Approximately 10 units will have belongings still in the common area packaged up or locked in their owners\u2019 unused rooms, according to the university. The UVa Medical Center is setting up a donation center to receive personal protective equipment \u2014 including masks, hand sanitizer, liquid hand soap and non-latex disposable gloves \u2014 from community members, businesses and other groups. UVa says the donations will help the hospital continue to maintain the PPE needed to care for COVID-19 patients from across the region. \u201cWe are extremely grateful to the community for supporting our health care workers and each other during this unprecedented time,\u201d said Dr. K. Craig Kent, UVa\u2019s executive vice president for health affairs, who also recognized the work of Equip Cville. The community effort has for the past two weeks been collecting PPE \u2014 both homemade and medical-grade \u2014 at Champion Brewing. UVa Health System spokesman Eric Swensen said the university hopes to get medical-grade equipment donated, but that \u201cwe welcome all donations. If for some reason we can\u2019t use it at UVa, we\u2019ll work with community partners to make sure all donated items go to someone that can use it.\u201d Donations can be made at the loading dock behind the Education Resource Center at 1240 Lee St. There will be signage posted to direct community members to the donation center. The center will be open 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. seven days a week. Anyone with questions can call (434) 924-2390. UVa on Friday also informed employees of a universal mask policy for health care workers, effective 6 a.m. Saturday. All care providers will be asked to wear a procedural or surgical mask when they enter the facility and keep it on until they leave the facility. Employees working in non-patient care areas can wear cloth masks, which will be available next week. Until then, team members in non-patient care areas can wear procedural or surgical masks. Swensen said UVa has \u201cstrong commitments\u201d from PPE suppliers, and is \u201cworking aggressively and daily to secure additional sources.\u201d \u201cWe believe we are well positioned to be able to preserve an appropriate level of protection for all staff for the duration of this pandemic, but it will require us to employ careful and appropriate management of these limited resources,\u201d he said. City trash stickers, CAT The city of Charlottesville will now process orders for individual and business trash stickers by mail, for the duration of the local emergency. Eligible businesses may submit a Quarterly Decal Order Form. Individual trash stickers may be ordered by submitting the Trash Sticker Order Form or by visiting the various retailers that sell individual stickers listed on the city\u2019s website. Forms and more information about services can be found at charlottesville.org\/departments-and-services\/departments-a-g\/city-treasurer\/trash-stickers. Large-item collection will resume April 13 and occur every other week, instead of every week, the city said. The city also announced new limits to CAT bus ridership; each bus now will be limited to 10 passengers. The service standard change comes from the state\u2019s Guidance for Transit Agencies. Additional service adjustments may occur as COVID-19 conditions change, the city said. For more updates, visit catchthecat.org or find CAT on social media. Questions can be directed to CAT@charlottesville.org or (434) 970-3649. Park ambassadors Albemarle County said Friday that, beginning Saturday, park visitors will see park ambassadors in high-use parks at peak times. They will monitor parks and encourage visitors to observe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention social distancing guidelines.","56":"Nurses know the vulnerability of their community. That\u2019s Kellen Squire\u2019s take as an emergency department nurse: That nurses did not sign up to effectively run into battle with no weapons or armor, but know they\u2019ll stay on the front lines and do what\u2019s needed. \u201cIt\u2019s like when they say, \u2018Anybody that doesn\u2019t want to be in this mission, you can leave now,\u2019 and nobody leaves \u2014 that\u2019s how it\u2019s been,\u201d he said. Squire, who works at Sentara Martha Jefferson Hospital, said COVID-19 has brought many changes to the day-to-day work of nurses. \u201cWhen I decided to become an emergency department nurse I never thought I\u2019d go from Nazis to world-shattering pandemics \u2026 but here we are,\u201d he said. In 2017, Squire, who\u2019s been a nurse since 2011, was among emergency room nurses at both Martha Jefferson and the University of Virginia Medical Center who treated injuries from the Unite the Right rally. Last month, his team began gearing up to handle COVID-19 patients, and now treats everyone who enters the emergency room as if they may have the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. Sentara Healthcare has said in statements that it could confirm its organization had \u201cseen patients who tested positive for COVID-19,\u201d but has not specified which locations. Hospitals in Virginia have largely been reticent to give regular estimates of the numbers of patients being treated for the disease, though UVa official Dr. K. Craig Kent said on Thursday that he estimated roughly 25 people in the Charlottesville area were being treated between the UVa and Martha Jefferson hospitals, which tracks with recent hospitalization information released by the Thomas Jefferson Health District. As of Saturday afternoon, the district, which includes Charlottesville and Albemarle, Fluvanna, Greene and Nelson counties, was reporting a total of 90 COVID-19 lab-confirmed and clinically diagnosed cases. Though the area does not yet have an overwhelming number of confirmed cases, it is affected by a dwindling national supply of medical supplies, which experts estimate will be insufficient to manage the outbreak. One of the biggest initial issues for Squire\u2019s team has been a limited supply of personal protective equipment, he said. Hospitals in the Sentara network are currently accepting equipment donations in an effort to stretch their stock. Prior to the pandemic, unless someone came into the emergency room with a known serious disease, Squire said he usually only wore gloves. \u201cYou wear gloves appropriately, you\u2019re putting an IV in somebody because you want to be open and accessible,\u201d he said. \u201cOne of the big things with wearing masks all the time now is we have a lot of people with hearing problems and a lot of them read lips. So what do you do when you have to wear a mask all the time? Right? We did it less before to be open, a comforting environment for the patients and stuff. And now, obviously, it\u2019s all flipped on its head.\u201d Squire said the hospital has given care providers information about how to sanitize equipment appropriately so that it is safe to reuse. \u201cI\u2019m wearing personal protective equipment now that a month ago probably would have at least gotten me written up if not fired,\u201d he said. \u201c... I\u2019ve got a face shield that I reuse, until I can\u2019t anymore, \u2018till something happens that it won\u2019t keep me protected.\u201d Other protocols for procedures, such as breathing treatments for asthma attacks, have also been changed. \u201cThat\u2019s also a good way to spray virus everywhere because they breathe into it and it aerosolized in their lungs, so we don\u2019t do that anymore,\u201d Squire said. \u201cWe\u2019re using inhalers with spacers now.\u201d Now that more Virginians are staying home, he said he feels projections for supply of PPE and bed capacity is looking much better. The hospital is handling shifting demands as well as it can, he said, and is working tirelessly to keep employees safe. As much as his work life has changed, Squire said the pandemic has affected his home life as well. He\u2019s terrified he\u2019s going to bring COVID-19 home and infect his three children, who are 12, 6 and 3 years old. \u201cI know that kids for the most part, not always, get much milder symptoms, but a lot of people have a misconception ... the mild cases that we\u2019ve heard about, people felt like they\u2019re one step from death,\u201d he said. The passenger side of Squire\u2019s truck is now a contamination zone, he said, where he leaves his shoes on the floor after work and sprays them with a disinfectant. \u201cI spray them and leave them in there and they don\u2019t come in the house,\u201d he said. \u201cI get naked in the garage and throw the stuff in the washing machine then immediately go to the shower, so it takes a lot longer to come home than I used to.\u201d Assuming he has already been exposed, Squire said he\u2019s checking his temperature frequently and, while walking around his house, he\u2019ll \u201cjust stop and I\u2019ll smell something\u201d because loss of smell and taste can be an initial symptom of COVID-19. \u201cThe new normal in my house is to lounge around, avoid the kids, take my temperature and then smell stuff, so it\u2019s fun times,\u201d he said. Despite all the struggles, Squire said the Charlottesville area has a dedicated group of emergency service providers and health care professionals who are as well-prepared as they can be. \u201cThere are a lot of communities that will be much worse off than we are, so I take solace in that and that I have a fantastic group of colleagues both that work in my facility and work in other facilities that will go to the mat for the people here,\u201d he said.","57":"When Gov. Ralph Northam shut down school buildings for the rest of the year, he told child care providers to prioritize children of essential personnel. Since that order, Charlottesville-area organizations have worked to determine the need in the community, as well as which providers are either open or able to reopen. \u201cRight now, the need isn\u2019t that significant,\u201d said Barbara Hutchinson, vice president of community impact for the United Way of Greater Charlottesville. \u201cI\u2019m assuming folks have patched together help from family or are working from home.\u201d The joint Emergency Operations Center surveyed major essential employers in the area about child care needs, she said. Hutchinson said the local United Way is prepared to help providers reopen if the need changes, which she expects could happen if local COVID-19 cases significantly increase and the hours of first responders and health care professionals change. For right now, Hutchinson said providers are in a \u201cvicious cycle.\u201d \u201cWe may end up losing some providers, and the area doesn\u2019t have the extra capacity to lose them,\u201d she said. Hutchinson said she typically works with about 40 child care centers \u2014 many of which work with economically disadvantaged families. Now, she estimates that six to 10 centers are open. \u201cIt\u2019s another industry that has been devastated by the virus,\u201d she said. Albemarle County and Charlottesville school divisions also have explored offering emergency child care. State officials have said school building use during the closure is a local decision. \u201cWe stand ready to provide this service should it be needed,\u201d city schools Superintendent Rosa Atkins said. Albemarle has established a working group to develop a plan. To assist employees, the University of Virginia has expanded options for backup child care through a partnership with BrightHorizons, said Adam Weikel, an assistant vice president of human resources. The expanded backup care program includes using vacant spots in local licensed child care facilities, in-home care and reimbursement for parents who secure their own care with a relative, family friend or familiar babysitter. UVa also partnered with SitterCity.com to help cover the cost for employees and help them to access an expanded network of caregivers in the community. Those in need of child care services can call Child Care Aware VA at (866) KIDS-TLC or go to vachildcare.com\/ to find a provider. Hutchinson said those who are open are following best practices to protect children, such as not eating lunch in large groups and keeping one group on the playground at a time. \u201cI think it could be done safely,\u201d she said. Day care providers do have to abide by the 10-person limit on gatherings. Gail Esterman, the director of early learning with ReadyKids, said area child care providers face several hard choices as they grapple with ramifications of the pandemic. \u201cGroup care for young children on a good day is a germ fest,\u201d she said. \u201cKids don\u2019t understand social distancing and hygiene.\u201d Those that remain open have to do so with fewer children, which means less income. \u201cThis is an invisible industry,\u201d she said. \u201cThe average child care worker makes less than someone working at McDonald\u2019s. But they provide a crucial service.\u201d Margaret Leckrone, owner of Foundations Child Development Center in Albemarle County, said staff members who are not working with children are cleaning the facilities and disinfecting toys. Students and staff members are checked daily for signs and symptoms of illness. Older children have their own desk and set of supplies such as markers and playdough, so they don\u2019t share. \u201cEach kid has their own tricycle with their name on it,\u201d Leckrone said. Still, Leckrone has seen her numbers drop in recent weeks. She typically has about 110 children but now about 10 to 20 regularly show up, at different times. Foundations is open to infants to 12-year-olds. Leckrone said she\u2019s had some interest from school-age children, but she hasn\u2019t taken on many other kids. \u201cWe\u2019re figuring all this out right now,\u201d she said. She decided to stay open because many of her families were essential personnel. \u201cThey are doing important jobs and we are doing important work,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re hanging in there, but it\u2019s stressful.\u201d","58":"The University of Virginia announced Monday it is providing $3 million to assist contract employees and local residents left furloughed and financially strapped by state-ordered stay-at-home measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. UVa President Jim Ryan announced that the university would set up a $2 million emergency assistance fund for contract employees and workers who have been furloughed. The university also will provide $1 million to the Charlottesville Albemarle Community Foundation to support the foundation\u2019s efforts to help area residents. Ryan said that, while furloughed contract employees are eligible for unemployment and other programs, those benefits have not been quick enough to arrive. \u201cWe have kept our employees on our payroll, and we will continue to do so for as long as we can. Some of our contractors, including Aramark, have furloughed their employees. More may do so in the future,\u201d Ryan said in a letter to the university community at community at-large. \u201cThese workers are entitled to state and federal unemployment benefits, as well as some benefits being offered directly by their employers,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has become clear that these benefits are not flowing as quickly as any of us would like, and that our contract workers need immediate assistance.\u201d The call to aid contract employees, many of whom have worked for the university for years, comes after petitions and GoFundMes were set up to assist workers, who told C-Ville Weekly they received little communication or assistance after the university decided to shut its doors and move many classes and work online in order to stem the spread of the novel coronavirus. Aramark, the contractor named by Ryan in the letter, operates the university dining halls, stadium concessions and other services on Grounds. In January, contract employees were granted a $15 an hour wage as part of UVa\u2019s effort to raise workers\u2019 wages to a livable wage in the area. But the SARS-Cov-2 virus, which causes COVID-19, put that effort down. Aramark furloughed employees on March 18 and on April 1 told employees and investors that it would slash executive salaries and furlough other employees in the virus\u2019 wake. \u201cIn light of the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on Aramark\u2019s business, on April 1, 2020, the Board of Directors of Aramark decided to temporarily reduce the salaries of certain of Aramark\u2019s senior executives, including the named executive officers, by 25% and to temporarily reduce the cash retainer fee of the directors by 25%, in each case effective April 6, 2020,\u201d the company\u2019s April 1 8-K form filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission states. Included in the filing is an April 1 letter from Aramark CEO John Zillmer that noted furloughed employees who are eligible for the company\u2019s medical plan would remain eligible until June 30. \u201cIt is an extraordinary time, full of uncertainty but we will get through it if we focus on moving forward together,\u201d Zillmer wrote. \u201cWe have a solid balance sheet and believe that the strength of our customer relationships, combined with what we expect will be increased demand for quality and hygiene worldwide when normalcy returns, will enable us to come out of this with renewed purpose and resolve.\u201d Ryan said that while contract employees with Aramark and other businesses who have been furloughed qualify for several benefits, there is a gap between the amount of relief available through unemployment payments and \u201cmeeting the necessities of life.\u201d \u201cOur own employees may also be facing unexpected costs due to the crisis we are all facing,\u201d he said. \u201cFor these reasons, we are devoting $2 million to create an emergency assistance fund for UVa contract workers and employees.\u201d Ryan said that paying salaries or wages for those furloughed would make them ineligible for state and federal benefits. \u201cBut we can provide funding to help meet an array of needs related to the crisis. Our primary focus will be to help those who have been furloughed, but this fund will also be available for those still employed and facing unexpected costs,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will also be providing assistance to furloughed contract workers who need help in applying for state and federal unemployment benefits, and we expect this fund to be a helpful bridge to those who are awaiting benefits,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will keep this fund operational until June 1st, and we will reassess at that point.\u201d Ryan said the university would also support the community through the $1 million CACF donation. CACF already has raised more than $2.3 million for that purpose, Ryan said. \u201cI am pleased to partner with the university during this crisis,\u201d Brennan Gould, president and CEO of the community foundation, said in a statement. \u201cWhile this health pandemic does not discriminate based on socioeconomic position, we do know that existing economic inequities position low-wage workers to be the most vulnerable to its financial consequences.\u201d Gould said she encourages contract workers at UVa and low-wage workers across the region to seek help by calling a community resource hotline at (434) 234-4490, weekdays between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m.. CACF has partnered with The United Way of Greater Charlottesville, Cville Community Cares, the city Charlottesville and Albemarle County to create the emergency fund. The fund was set up March 23 and some disbursements have been made. Officials did not have an estimate how much money has been distributed. \u201cA core aspiration of our strategic plan is to be a university that is both great and good. Toward that end, we have committed to doing our best to be a good neighbor and to live our values,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cThat means, among other things, doing what we can to support our most vulnerable community members.\u201d Details on accessing the money and how the funds will operate as well as other efforts by UVa are expected to be released later this week, Ryan said. \u201cWe will have more to say later this week about additional steps we are going to take to support our community,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cWe face challenges ahead. We will only get through them by working together and doing what we can to support each other.\u201d","59":"On a call Monday, Democratic Sen. Mark R. Warner and local officials gave updates and answered questions about the effects of the pandemic and the federal government\u2019s response. \u201cI think we\u2019re going through what\u2019s going to be some of the toughest next 10 or 12 days, probably that Charlottesville, Virginia and our country have faced,\u201d Warner said, citing economic uncertainty and the number of people with the virus increasing. The Virginia Department of Health reported Monday that 2,878 people in Virginia have tested positive for COVID-19. The Thomas Jefferson Health District did not report an update in local cases Monday, citing a new data system. Charlottesville Mayor Nikuyah Walker, Charlottesville Regional Chamber of Commerce President and CEO Elizabeth Cromwell and Center for Nonprofit Excellence Executive Director Cristine Nardi all told Warner that local businesses owners and nonprofit directors have had issues with the applications for loans and other federal small business offerings. \u201c... Many small businesses, including nonprofits, are finding it challenging in accessing the portals, and it\u2019s creating some considerable stress since everyone knows that the money will eventually run out,\u201d Nardi said. A $2.2 trillion economic relief package was signed into law at the end of March, which includes about $350 billion in loans for companies with 500 employees or fewer. There are four new temporary U.S. Small Business Administration programs to address the COVID-19 outbreak, in addition to programs set up locally. Walker, Cromwell and Nardi said, locally, owners are having issues accessing the applications or are not receiving any kind of confirmation once their applications have been submitted, among other things. Many across the country ran into issues on Friday when the applications opened, according to reporting by the The Associated Press. Warner said he thinks the bumps in the SBA program are getting \u201cironed out\u201d and he\u2019s hoping things will start getting better this week. Nardi said that some lenders for the Paycheck Protection Program are choosing only to work with present customers because of the challenge in putting together the portal, and that some of the area\u2019s smaller nonprofits don\u2019t have an acting banking relationship. Warner said that the program was supposed to extend to non-traditional banking services, and if that if Nardi continued to find banks unwilling to take on a new client or nonprofit, that would be \u201cdisturbing\u201d to him. \u201cThat was not Congress\u2019 intent,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to try to make this as easy as possible, and there\u2019s supposed to be enough origination fees in this to make it worthwhile for the institution to pick up the business.\u201d University of Virginia President Jim Ryan and Executive Vice President for Health Affairs Dr. K. Craig Kent were also on the call and spoke about the university\u2019s response thus far. Ryan said there are now fewer than 300 students, down from 7,000, who are living on Grounds, and said the university is now really focusing on the health system, emergency preparedness and the financial impact of the pandemic. The UVa Medical Center opened 15 new beds last week, and plans to increase capacity further in the coming weeks. He said the next phase of efforts is thinking about what to do for the fall. \u201cOur hope, obviously, is that we\u2019ll be able to be back to normal for the fall, but it\u2019s honestly too early to tell and we\u2019re now working to identify the date by which we need to make that decision,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cWe\u2019d like to push it back as far as possible because we\u2019ll have better information.\u201d Kent said that the medical center is obtaining equipment to sterilize some health care workers\u2019 face masks so that they\u2019ll be able to be reused. UVa also has set up its own donation spot for PPE and is preparing to move some first responders into residence halls. The health system also has been enhancing capabilities for telemedicine for patients who don\u2019t feel comfortable coming in but have a condition that needs to be addressed. \u201cWe\u2019ve continued to do surgery on certainly emergent patients, but ones that will be harmed if we delay their surgery over a significant period of time,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve kept our clinics open to people that have semi-urgent and urgent problems and so our physicians are still at work trying to take care of the needy people that have the healthcare problems that are unrelated to COVID.\u201d Walker, Cromwell and Nardi also asked about expanding the federal government\u2019s response, such as providing more direct grants to nonprofits, payroll protections for governments and future stimulus payments for Americans, among other things. Warner said he would be open to another one-time payment for residents, but said he would prefer targeting relief for families that are most affected by lost wages or lost jobs. \u201cMy highest priority though is where we have gaps in this CARES bill and where there are people that are really suffering the most, particularly if we missed them in this CARES package,\u201d he said. \u201cI would like for you all to consider also payroll protections for governments,\u201d Walker said. \u201cWe\u2019re a city and we\u2019re attempting to keep all of our employees employed on payroll, and with revenue decline, and it\u2019s going to be a challenge even for cities to figure that out.\u201d Warner said there was about $3.3 billion that\u2019s going to states to help with local governments, but more may be needed in the next bill. Cromwell said she would like to have a plan for reopening the business community and resilience plans, and said she is considering launching an economic recovery leadership council. \u201cI think that all of our members are busy with ... the 10 alarm fire, and what we really need to be looking at as well is what does this economy look like a year from now, and what have we learned through this whole process?\u201d she said \u201cAnd how can we put some of that learning into action and maybe start some new businesses as a result of you know, the ones that have unfortunately shut down?\u201d Warner said it\u2019s \u201cdisgraceful\u201d how ill-prepared the U.S. was for the pandemic in terms of ability to effectively test for the virus and provide personal protective equipment. \u201cI think we can\u2019t even get to talking about reopening until we have more adequacy of tests and we have more of that equipment,\u201d he said. \u201c...I do think we need to think afterwards. I think this will have as much an effect on our country, our government as [September 11] had.\u201d","60":"The university announced this week that it is making available $2 million in aid to contract workers whose companies serve the school, and another $1million to the community at large. UVa is keeping its own employees on the job and \u201cwill continue to do so for as long as we can,\u201d said President Jim Ryan. But some companies that supply services to the university have instituted furloughs, leaving employees without paychecks. Unemployment insurance is available to cover at least some of the gap in income, but Mr. Ryan noted that such relief has been slow in coming. In an effort to get aid to filers as quickly as possible, Virginia has lifted some restrictions on unemployment insurance in response to the pandemic, such as the requirement that workers be looking for a new job. The state also waived the usual one-week waiting period. But the sheer volume of claims \u201cis overwhelming our unemployment system,\u201d Gov. Ralph Northam reported late last week. \u201cPeople have had issues with our website.\u201d The system normally handles a couple of hundred claims a day. Now that daily number is in the thousands. In the week ending March 28, 12,497 initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits were filed. The last two weeks of the month saw more claims filed than in all of 2019. Another anticipated complication is that the federal Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act expands the categories of people who are eligible for insurance. Virginia will have to retool its system to accommodate those changes. The state will be expanding capacity, including bringing in a contractor to handle phone calls about routine unemployment questions, giving staff time to address more complex issues. It\u2019s unsurprising that systems are not equipped to deal with health and economic crises of this magnitude. That\u2019s why supplemental efforts are necessary \u2014 the more nimble, the better. UVa\u2019s Ryan noted that the $2 million emergency fund can\u2019t pay wages or salaries, since that would make workers ineligible for unemployment insurance. But it can help bridge the gap for those having difficulty \u201cmeeting the necessities of life.\u201d The fund will stay up and running until June 1, at which time the university will reassess the need. More information is expected to be released this week. UVa also donated $1 million to the Charlottesville Albemarle Community Foundation to help residents in general. That\u2019s a significant boost to an effort that already had raised $2.3 million. Low-income workers from across the region, including contract workers at UVa, can call (434) 234-4490, weekdays between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m., to access a community help hotline, said foundation President and CEO Brennan Gould. This region is fortunate to have more resources, both medical and financial, than do many communities in order to meet the extraordinary demands imposed by today\u2019s crisis.","61":"The Thomas Jefferson Health District is now reporting three deaths related to COVID-19. The first death, of a woman in her 80s, was reported March 31. The district gave an updated death count after a request from The Progress, and a spokeswoman, Kathryn Goodman, said no further information was available. The district, which includes Charlottesville and Albemarle, Greene, Nelson, Louisa and Fluvanna counties, reported 100 cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, Tuesday evening. The district has previously reported the number of confirmed cases by locality, determined by where the infected person lives, but said that information was not currently available due to a new data system. The district also said it expects to provide an update on the demographic breakdown of confirmed cases later this week. Virginia Department of Health statistics Tuesday morning showed Albemarle County having 38 COVID-19 cases confirmed and Charlottesville with 23, but department and district case numbers often do not match. Three reported cases of COVID-19 in the area have occurred at senior living facilities, but officials have not reported widespread community transmission within those facilities, as has happened in other Virginia complexes. Westminster-Canterbury of the Blue Ridge, a Charlottesville-area retirement home that reported a case last week, has taken significant efforts to combat spread, according to Erin Garvey, director of development. Garvey said the initial case remains the only diagnosed case as of Tuesday. Following the diagnosis, Garvey said the complex worked with the Virginia Department of Health to screen everyone who had contact with the infected individual. All residents have been following shelter in place guidelines, she said, and the complex recently implemented a mask policy for staff members, requiring them to wear masks at all times. The Lodge at Old Trail, which reported a positive COVID-19 diagnosis last month, did not return requests for comment or any updates about its situation. The Colonnades also did not immediately return a request for comment. A pandemic tracking site set up by the Virginia Hospital and Healthcare Alliance shows nearly 1,200 Virginians being treated for COVID-19 on Tuesday, including more than 400 who are in intensive care units and 283 of those patients on ventilators. The website gathers information from hospitals and physicians across the state and includes patients who have been tested, but results have not been returned. The organization does not break down the numbers by locality or region. The number is much higher than that reported by VDH, which shows only 563 hospitalizations on its website. The hospital and healthcare site indicated that only about 27% of ventilators in the state were currently in use, which means there is enough capacity at this point to handle serious cases of the disease. COVID-19 is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which can create pneumonia in a victim\u2019s lungs and require ventilators to breathe for a patient. A shortage of ventilators has been cited as a reason for the number of deaths caused by the virus around the world. Numbers from the University of Virginia Medical Center and Sentara Martha Jefferson Hospital were not readily available on Tuesday. A spokeswoman for Martha Jefferson said the hospital was \u201ccontinuing to see an increase in the number of positive COVID-19 patients we are treating,\u201d and that while the hospital currently had enough supplies, was monitoring them closely. \u201cWe continue to have capacity to care for patients in terms of beds, staff and ventilators, which has been helped by the new beds in our hospital expansion tower that opened last week,\u201d said Eric Swensen, UVa medical center spokesman. \u201cWe continue to monitor the situation closely and will adjust our plans as needed based on the latest information and projections,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are as prepared as a health system can be for an influx of patients.\u201d Swensen said hospital officials hope residents will continue to stay at home, keep distance between each other and follow recommendations from the CDC and other organizations.","62":"A fourth area person has died from COVID-19 and a Charlottesville funeral home has placed a refrigerated storage container on their property to help stave off possible overwhelming of mortuaries when the disease peaks. Thomas Jefferson Health District officials confirmed the fourth death on Wednesday. No further information about the person was released. Officials with the Charlottesville-UVa-Albemarle Regional Emergency Operations Center, the area\u2019s joint emergency management team, also announced that they are working with Hill and Wood Funeral Home to help store bodies of those who die from the disease and other causes. The rented storage unit at the funeral home is considered a contingency plan, operations center official said. \u201cAt this time, we at Hill and Wood have heard of other funeral homes being overwhelmed, especially in areas with large populations, which leaves a gap in the community\u2019s response to offer critical services for lost loved ones\u201d said Stephen Christianson, of Hill and Wood Funeral Home, in a statement. \u201cWe are renting this unit as a back-up plan for the community to ensure there are adequate facilities available during this challenging time.\u201d Funeral homes in New York City, Louisiana and other areas hit hard by the COVID-19 disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus have reported being overwhelmed by the sudden number of victims coming to the mortuaries. The unit at Hill and Wood would provide a storage location \u201cthat establishes means and methods for the sensitive, respectful, and orderly care of those who have died, from COVID-19 and other causes,\u201d the operations center statement reads. Because of Virginia\u2019s restrictions on public gatherings to 10 or fewer people, health district officials recommend that burials and cremations take place soon and that memorial services be held at a later date. \u201cFunerals are an important time for families and friends to come together to celebrate a loved one\u2019s life. During this difficult time, we are finding that many families want to delay funerals due to Virginia\u2019s stay at home order,\u201d said Dr. Denise Bonds, the health district\u2019s director, in a prepared statement. \u201cWhile we are sympathetic and understand how important funerals are, we encourage families to consider cremation or burial at this time, and plan a larger memorial service after the \u2018stay at home order\u2019 is lifted,\u201d Bonds said. Health district officials told The Daily Progress that they are working with the Virginia Department of Health, UVa and other agencies to try and determine when the number of cases in the area will hit peak, creating the heaviest demand on medical, and possibly mortuary, resources. Also on Wednesday, the National Park Service officially shuttered the entire Shenandoah National Park, closing the park\u2019s borders to all activities. \u201c[The park service] received a letter from the Rappahannock Rapidan Health District of the Virginia Department of Health recommending the full closure of Shenandoah National Park,\u201d officials said. The park is closed until further notice. No date was given when it may be reopened. U.S. 211 and U.S. 33 will remain accessible to pass through the park. Virginians planning to hike or picnic through state wildlife management areas should be aware of the start of spring turkey hunting season, Virginia Department of Game and Inland Fisheries said. The season starts Saturday and continues to May 16. \u201cDuring this time, hunters will be utilizing [areas] statewide to turkey hunt. Visitors can expect that hunters will be widely present on [the] properties,\u201d officials warned in a statement. The wildlife management areas are purchased and managed using funds generated from the sale of hunting and fishing licenses and through a federal excise tax on hunters and fishermen. The areas are open to other activities besides hunting. \u201cWhether you\u2019re biking, hiking, fishing, or just out for some fresh air, please be cognizant of your surroundings and hunters in the field,\u201d officials said. Aqua Virginia, which provides water to Lake Monticello residents and other areas of the state, announced Wednesday that it would donate $10,000 to three food banks across its service territory as a way to support communities in the pandemic. The money will be divided between the Blue Ridge Food Bank, which serves Central Virginia and Feeding America, in southwest Virginia and Feed More, which serves the Richmond area. UVa officials have deployed a website for qualifying employees of the university and its contractors to apply for assistance through a $2 million fund announced earlier this week by UVa President Jim Ryan. According to the website, https:\/\/hr.virginia.edu\/assistance-fund, to be eligible to receive a payment from the fund a person must be employed the university, UVa Medical Center, UVa College at Wise, University Physicians Group, employed or temporarily furloughed by a contracted firm or an associated organization or foundations.","63":"It\u2019s been more than 100 years since the last worldwide pandemic, and the world\u2019s reaction to the spread of COVID-19 bears many similarities. The closest comparison to such a pandemic occurred about a century ago when an influenza outbreak spread across the world, killing millions. The so-called Spanish flu, expanding as World War I neared its end, led governments around the world to take measures to curb the disease\u2019s spread. \u201cNone of us dealt with this the last time we dealt with this as a world in 1918,\u201d Charlottesville Mayor Nikuyah Walker said in a recent virtual town hall. \u201cThis is a new experience. We\u2019re going to be making decisions as we go.\u201d American life was shut down then as now, although looking through the lens of modern times, it may not feel as stark and sudden as the current situation. Sports were in their infancy, prohibition meant no bars and retail shopping wasn\u2019t an integral part of life. However, Christian McMillen, a University of Virginia history professor, noted that people \u201cdidn\u2019t know what they didn\u2019t know.\u201d \u201cWithin their own context, they certainly felt the restrictions placed on them,\u201d McMillen said. Resistance to the calls for social distancing and quarantines is nothing new either, McMillen said, noting that people in England and Italy were unhappy with orders not to hold Catholic Mass during previous cholera pandemics. \u201cThree hundred or 400 years ago, people were upset as they are now,\u201d he said. \u201cI think reactions across time have been broadly similar.\u201d Although there are some differences, the similarities in government response and the burden on the health care system from coronavirus and the Spanish flu bear striking resemblance. The Spanish flu first appeared in the United States in Kansas in March 1918 and came in several waves, but the biggest impact was in the fall. In October 1918 alone, 195,000 Americans died, according to Lawrence Sondhaus, director of the Institute for the Study of War and Diplomacy at the University of Indianapolis. By the time the pandemic ran its course, an estimated 28% of Americans and 20% of the world population had been infected. Many victims were between the ages of 20 and 40. On Oct. 4, 1918, The Daily Progress ran an editorial calling the flu pandemic a \u201cdirect infliction of the monstrous war.\u201d U.S. soldiers spread it as they moved between bases and then transferred it as they went overseas to fight in Europe. McMillen said that pandemics are typically spread through trade and travel. They have grown increasingly widespread over time as technology has improved. McMillen noted that the plague spread through trade routes and travel and, although it took longer to become widespread than has the coronavirus, \u201cthe mechanisms are the exact same.\u201d \u201cI think the speed of travel perhaps is the only thing that\u2019s changed, which means response times have to be quicker, as well,\u201d he said. The first case of coronavirus in the U.S. was a Washington state man who had visited Wuhan, China. {span}The coronavirus has killed more than 82,000 worldwide as of Wednesday, according to the CDC. In the United States, more than 12,000 people have died, with at least 75 of those in Virginia.{\/span} The flu pandemic killed more than 50 million people worldwide. In the United States, 675,000 people died, with 16,000 of those in Virginia. Overall, an estimated 2,100 residents in Charlottesville and Albemarle County caught influenza, with 227 dying, according to death certificates studied by Encyclopedia Virginia. The project notes that those in rural areas of the county died without a doctor\u2019s care and were buried at home, so the numbers could be higher. The first notice of a local death from the flu appeared on the front page of The Daily Progress on Sept. 30, 1918. Cecil Monds, a student at Fork Union Military Academy, succumbed to the pneumonia that accompanied the virus that scientists now believe may have been a strain of the H1N1 virus. The city was helped by the medical school at UVa, according to Encyclopedia Virginia, but nothing was easy. The Progress reported in October 1918 that the University Hospital was so crowded that \u201cin order to make room for the students, many outside patients are being turned down.\u201d In a move that is all-too-familiar to what is happening now, on Oct. 5, 1918, Charlottesville Mayor E.G. Haden ordered all schools, churches and public places closed for nine days, just one day after the start of the Albemarle County Fair. \u201cSunday promises to be a quiet day in Charlottesville as the churches will be closed and the autos idle,\u201d one story in The Progress said. That same day, The Progress ran stories about two local residents getting sick. McMillen said that bans on public gatherings during pandemics are a long-established response dating as far back as the bubonic plague in Europe during the 1340s. Similar measures were taken with cholera outbreaks throughout the 1800s. McMillen said the public health responses in the U.S. have been piecemeal and on different timelines, a consistency across history. \u201cJust like now, during 1918, the response was very local; it wasn\u2019t a national response,\u201d he said. \u201cThe U.S. government has always left these matters to the different states as they see fit.\u201d In 1918, movie houses and pool rooms were shut down, milk delivery was suspended and a plea went out from the telephone company to limit phone use as only three of the 16 operators were well enough to come to work. Deaths were reported nearly every day, affecting all ages and dotting The Progress front page among the overpowering articles on the war and the numerous pleas for bond purchases in the Liberty Loan drive. One man, Grover Clements of Ivy, died a month before he was supposed to marry his fiance, Mary Carrie Easton. Labor shortages at the gas plants led to service disruptions. The Red Cross was making face masks to fill an \u201cimmediate need,\u201d mirroring a shortage of personal protective equipment that is present today. The newspaper also suffered and, under the headline \u201cProgress Hit Hard,\u201d announced on Oct. 7, 1918, that the pressman and page designers were sick. Within two days, so many carriers were sick that The Progress was just delivering papers to pharmacies and grocery stories for people to pick up. The flu was reported with the headline \u201cEpidemic Is Widespread.\u201d Jury trials were suspended, district nurses made calls for volunteers and a fourth-year UVa student died. Businesses were faced with restrictions as the mayor ordered ice cream shops and places selling soft drinks to no longer use glass cups, but instead use paper. One editorial described the closing order\u2019s effect on business, saying they \u201chave felt a sharp decline in business as never before in a generation.\u201d However, the editorial notes that everyone needed to bear the burden of the order, noting that Philadelphia saw a resurgence in cases after prematurely lifting its order. \u201c[I]t is too serious a matter to think of trying the experiment of opening up prematurely just now,\u201d the editorial said. \u201cWe have tried to din it into the heads of our good and progressive fellow citizens \u2026 just how we stand in the matter of public health and hygiene arrangements.\u201d The public is in a better situation now to learn about COVID-19\u2019s impact and severity than in 1918; during World War I, the U.S. government censored information about the pandemic in an effort to avoid harming morale. In fact, the name Spanish flu was adopted because Spain was neutral in World War I and didn\u2019t censor reporting about the pandemic, so more reports came from that country. To take lessons from historical pandemics, McMillen urged leaders to rely on scientific experts. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t do anybody any good to spread falsehoods,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople need to listen, and our leadership needs to let the people who actually know what they\u2019re doing when it comes to infectious diseases do their job.\u201d Rice University historian Douglas Brinkley told USA Today that one of the likely parallels to the 1918 pandemic will be a renewed appreciation in science and a rekindled admiration for doctors. The Progress told residents to pay attention to orders and advice from medical professionals during the flu pandemic, writing that, \u201cNo Man or woman should allow this warning to pass unheeded.\u201d Not everything during the 1918 pandemic reflects the current environment. Sports leagues in their infancy continued to play; the University of North Carolina announced that it hoped to face UVa in football by Thanksgiving Day. Weddings continued in 1918, unlike the current pandemic where many have been postponed. By Nov. 3, 1918, Haden lifted the order closing most public places in Charlottesville to the joy of many. \u201cThe public will rejoice to learn of the modification of the closing order \u2026 and can enjoy its restored liberty as to amusement tomorrow and religious worship in the churches on Sunday,\u201d one story said. McMillen said that governments need to continuously provide information, as situations rapidly evolve. \u201cIt\u2019s not that people need to come up with one answer and stick to it; it\u2019s always providing the public the most accurate information,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s informing the public with as much honesty and as much information that is available and not willfully diminishing the importance of the threat.\u201d","64":"Outpatient clinics, the emergency medical department and outpatient areas of the University of Virginia Medical Center and UVa Health System will close to visitors beginning Monday, officials announced Friday. The April 13 closings are designed to protect patients and healthcare workers during the pandemic, officials said. Exceptions are the rule to any order, however, and some visitors will be allowed for specific reasons. Pediatric patients are allowed one designated visitor; patients facing imminent death in the emergency department may have two visitors; and mothers in labor in the emergency department may have one visitor. All visitors will be screened before admittance and are asked to stay within the outpatient or emergency department confines except for trips to the cafeteria or restroom. All previously announced restrictions on visitors to UVa Health inpatient units remain in effect. Beginning Monday, all patients and visitors will have their temperatures checked when entering facilities at the main UVa Medical Center grounds, including the inpatient hospital and emergency department. The checks are in addition to symptom screening questions currently being asked. Patients with temperatures of more than 100 degrees will be provided a mask and visitors with fevers will not be permitted. Temperature checks will soon be instituted at all other UVa Health System facilities. Anyone with questions can call (434) 924-0000. Anyone who believes they may have COVID-19 or been exposed to it should call before traveling to the hospital.","65":"Throughout the Thomas Jefferson Health District, African Americans have tested positive for COVID-19 and required hospital care at disproportionate rates, according to the data released Friday. The data mirrors an emerging national trend and is an example of how, in the four weeks since the first case was reported in Charlottesville, the health district is still struggling to overcome testing obstacles to get a sense of the virus' spread throughout existing fault lines. \u201cWe know that African Americans have less access to health care, and that African Americans are more likely to be in our frontline jobs that put them at highest risk,\u201d said Dr. Denise Bonds, the director of the health district, which covers Charlottesville and the counties of Albemarle, Fluvanna, Greene, Louisa and Nelson. African Americans make up 32% of the confirmed cases and 63% of the 27 people hospitalized. Four people have died from the disease, caused by a novel coronavirus, but none of those individuals were African American, according to officials. The health district released demographic information about positive COVID-19 cases, which so far number 124, for the first time Friday during a virtual town hall with local and university officials. More than 4,500 people have tested positive in Virginia. Statewide, African Americans make up 15% of cases, but the race for half of all cases is unknown. State officials said this week they are working to improve the data collections to better report on the demographics of those with the disease. Health experts have said that African Americans, particularly those working in the service industry, are at a higher risk of being exposed to the virus, have a higher likelihood of health conditions that make the virus' impact worse, and have a higher likelihood of being without health insurance. \u201cI think we really need to get to the underlying cause of all of that, and that is that our country and our state have a long history of racism and policies that have generated these racial inequities,\u201d Bonds said during the town hall. \u201cAnd that's a conversation that we have been struggling with as a community and will continue to struggle with. And I think that this disease has just brought that out even further.\u201d The Thomas Jefferson Health District reported its first confirmed case March 16, and numbers have steadily climbed since. Officials also said they know they are not catching everyone who has the disease. \u201cWe certainly have community spread,\u201d Bonds said. \u201cWe know that there are individuals that are getting the disease and we can't always trace it to a particular source. That's an important message to get out to the community. There are lots of places that you can get it and really that's why we need you to stay home.\u201d About 21.7% of those diagnosed have been hospitalized; 63% are people 59 years or younger. The health district currently is not focusing available COVID-19 tests on the African American population, but Bonds said she\u2019s considering it. Right now, officials are testing people with symptoms of the disease, people in long-term care facilities and health care employees and first responders. About 1,400 individuals have been tested in the health district, Bonds said. Availability of test kits and supplies have hampered efforts to expand testing to more people. \u201cNow that we have more widely-available testing, we're in a position where we can really begin to target this particularly vulnerable group and now that we have statistics showing that I think that'll help bring the pressure that we need to really begin to focus on this,\u201d Bonds said. Bonds said officials need to start planning for how to help individuals in high-density housing isolate and quarantine if they are either showing symptoms or diagnosed with the disease. \u201cThose are all conversations that we need to have and frankly we need to be having them right now,\u201d she said. Dr. Costi Sifri, director of hospital epidemiology at the University of Virginia Medical Center, said during the town hall that a group of UVa experts are working on access to testing in communities of color. \u201cThat is something that at UVa we're very concerned and cognizant about too,\u201d Sifri said about testing and social inequities. National data shows that COVID-19 is hitting black Americans particularly hard; an early snapshot of confirmed cases by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows that, while the highest overall percentage of hospitalized patients were white, at 45%, the percentage of black patients, 33% was much higher than the percentage of African-Americans in the population as a whole. Gov. Ralph Northam highlighted the need for better data on how the virus is affecting different communities. \"We know that longstanding racial inequities in things like access to health care, education and economic opportunities lead to differences in underlying health conditions,\" Northam said during a press conference Wednesday. \u201c... It is difficult, but important for everyone to be reporting the same types of data, so we have a better picture of what this virus looks like here in Virginia. That obligates us to do a better job of tracking racial demographic data of confirmed cases\u201d Bonds said the district will not release demographic details that would identify an individual who has tested positive, and won\u2019t share any data points unless there are five or more cases. \u201cEven in a pandemic situation such as this, people deserve privacy, and we have already notified those individuals who would be at risk,\u201d Bonds said. Additionally, in order to compile Friday\u2019s report, health district staff members have to get caught up on data entry and collect missing demographic information. The lack of widespread testing is a hindrance to the health district\u2019s understanding of COVID-19, Bonds said in an interview before the town hall. \u201cI would love for [testing] to be more widespread,\u201d she said. \u201cI ordered test kits from one of the major testing companies to provide to nursing homes to test. We'll order 100 and get five kits.\u201d UVa developed its own test last month, which Bonds said has helped. Overall, Bonds said communities are heeding the call to stay at home. Hospitals also aren\u2019t exceeding their capacity yet. \u201cCertainly there is a strain on the health care system, but we're not seeing the overload that you might see on the news and in other areas,\u201d she said. Health district staff members try to investigate every positive case, contacting the individual and tracking where they went and who they came into contact with, as a way to contain the virus. An expanded team of about 10 people are doing those investigations. The district\u2019s highest daily number of new cases has been 11, which Bonds said is still within the staff's capability to handle and track. \u201cIf we started to get upwards consistently in the 20s, that would be a strain for us here,\u201d Bonds said in an interview. Bonds said investigators have linked many of the individuals who have COVID-19 to church gatherings and proceedings such as funerals. \u201cAlthough we all have the best intentions with social distancing, in those high-emotional situations, we reach out to each other, we shake each other's hands, we hug and we get close to each other because people want that comfort,\u201d she said. \u201cUnfortunately, what we're finding is that's also transmitting the disease.\u201d There is still some variability in how positive cases are reported by locality, particularly if a person lives in a ZIP code along the Albemarle-Charlottesville boundary. The district reports positive cases by locality, based on a person's residence, but hasn\u2019t reported deaths by locality because of limited numbers so far. \u201cI think we'd have to see a pretty significant increase before we broke it down by locality and providing much, if any, in the way of demographics,\u201d Bonds said.","66":"When Anthony Clore puts down his badge and picks up his Bible there is no sudden transformation or personality switch. It\u2019s simply the veteran Virginia State Police trooper continuing his effort to help others, albeit in a different uniform. Senior Trooper Clore is a motor carrier safety officer in charge of enforcing the rules and regulations on commercial vehicles in the area around Fluvanna County. He\u2019s also the pastor of Fork Union Baptist Church in his native county. The mix of vocation and avocation is natural for Clore. \u201cI always wanted to be in law enforcement and my father was in law enforcement so it really wasn\u2019t a difficult decision for me. It was kind of natural,\u201d Clore said. \u201cI also grew up in church and learned the teachings of the Bible and loved the Lord and have always had a relationship with my Savior. But about 10 years ago, when I became a dad, I decided I need to get more back into church.\u201d With the COVID-19 pandemic keeping people at home per Gov. Ralph Northam\u2019s orders, there won\u2019t be many people going into church this Easter. Clore will record his Easter sermon for electronic dissemination to his congregation. It\u2019s a little different, Clore said, but the method provides opportunities to take belief into the home. \u201cIt\u2019s been a challenge because my personality is to preach the word, encourage people and challenge them and reach out to them. It\u2019s different to pick up a Bible and a microphone and stand up and preach to nobody but the recorder,\u201d he admitted. \u201cThe truth is that it\u2019s not really about what\u2019s in front of me. It\u2019s about doing what I can with what I have right now to help people,\u201d Clore said. \u201cIt\u2019s been just as hard on them because church is that place where people go to see their friends, maybe get that hug that they need or a handshake and be a part of something, to feel they belong.\u201d Clore hopes that the social distancing and shut-down of religious services and public gathering places will encourage people to take their religion home with them. \u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity to realize that the church is not confined to a building,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s inside all of us.\u201d That belief is what got Clore out from under the wheel of his cruiser and back behind the pulpit. As a new father, he began reading the Bible and praying at home, which then led Clore to go back to church. Getting back into church led him to getting involved in services. Getting involved in church services led him to deliver sermons. That then took him to other churches as a visiting preacher and a modern circuit rider, a pastor who regularly moves from church to church. Two years ago, he arrived at a permanent gig as the full-time pastor of Fork Union Baptist Church. It wasn\u2019t exactly what the career police officer had in mind. But when he was moved from patrol to the motor carrier division, his hours on the road changed and he found himself with more time on Sunday to spend with a congregation. \u201cI didn\u2019t set out to do it, no, but I started realizing that this was an important part of my life and something that I was being called to do, but it wasn\u2019t easy. I finally had to accept that this is what I was supposed to do,\u201d he laughed. \u201cAs much as I was trying to run from it, I knew He was calling me. When I moved to the motor carrier unit, it was just a big example of how all of this was coming together,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was more than coincidence.\u201d There are no real conflicts between the careers, Clore said. Both jobs are simply matters of taking care of people. Recently, the duties came together when some members of his church and the Fork Union community got together to sew cloth face masks for medical providers. The masks now are recommended wear for all people in the U.S. walking out and about in the time of pandemic, but are especially important for medical workers. Although not technically proper personal protection equipment, homemade masks may be worn by hospital staff and physicians when not in a clinical setting. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended wearing one after preliminary studies showed that SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, may be spread simply by talking as well as sneezing and coughing. When area residents started sewing, Clore became the go-between to get the finished products to the University of Virginia Medical Center and Sentara Martha Jefferson Hospital. \u201cMy wife had the idea that I could just go by people\u2019s homes and they could leave the masks outside for me and I could gather them up and deliver them,\u201d Clore said, noting that his state police leadership supported the effort. \u201cIt\u2019s not something we\u2019re doing on a large scale, but every little bit helps. We get them to the UVa hospital and Martha Jefferson hospital and they were appreciative,\u201d he said. Clore\u2019s avocation has impacted his vocation in other ways. Besides getting the chance to help his fellow man, he\u2019s found more empathy. \u201cWhen I was younger, I felt like I was there to enforce the law and I still believe that, but I see people not just for what they\u2019ve done but I understand that sometimes things happen that lead to actions,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I realized how important it was to be forgiven, I started looking at people as creations of God. I still believe in enforcing the law, but I understand there are sometimes things that cause people to act certain ways. So if someone is yelling at me during a traffic stop right from the get-go, it may not be me they\u2019re angry at,\u201d he said. \u201cI guess I\u2019d say I\u2019m not a state trooper who happens to be a Christian,\u201d Clore said. \u201cI\u2019m a Christian who happens to be a state trooper.\u201d","67":"On Wednesday, Gov. Ralph Northam announced he was postponing Virginia\u2019s June primary and also requested the General Assembly postpone May municipal elections to November to protect the health and safety of residents during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Scottsville mayor and all seven seats on Town Council are on the May ballot, and Albemarle Registrar Jake Washburne said he and his office are still processing work for the scheduled election. \u201cAs each day goes by, we get another absentee application from Scottsville and we process it,\u201d he said. \u201c...So we\u2019re kind of on pins and needles waiting to hear.\u201d The General Assembly would have to consider the governor\u2019s request during the veto session on April 22. Candidates for mayor on the current May 5 ballot are Charlotte Staton-Joyner and Ron Smith. Town Council members Daniel Gritsko, Joshua Peck, Laura Mellusi, Zachary Bullock, Stuart Munson and Edward Payne are seeking re-election, while Jim Tocci and Matthew Thacker are on the ballot for the first time. Councilor Joshua Peck and Mayor Nancy Gill are not seeking re-election. In March, Northam encouraged all Virginians to vote absentee in the May 5 elections. \u201cWhen we found that out, we sent out postcard notices to all the registered voters in Scottsville advising them that this was an option, pleading with them to use this option so that we would hopefully have as few people come and vote in person on May 5 as possible,\u201d Washburne said. On Friday, he said the total number of registered voters in the Town of Scottsville is 399, and 360 of those voters reside in Albemarle; the town boundary also extends into Fluvanna County. Washburne\u2019s office had sent out a total of 73 absentee ballots to residents who requested the ballots and have received 11 back so far. If the election stays in May, the last day to register to vote or update an existing registration is Monday. The deadline to request an absentee ballot to be mailed is April 28, but that request must be received by the registrar by 5 p.m. that day. Voters can request an absentee ballot online or by calling the registrar\u2019s office at (434) 972-4173. In the 2018 town elections, just 57 people voted; 126 people voted in the 2016 Scottsville elections. Gill said she wants the elections to stay in May because there is already a very active absentee ballot effort going on. She\u2019s sent letters to Sen. R. Creigh Deeds, D-Bath, and Del. Rob Bell, R-Albemarle, about keeping the elections in May. \u201cWe\u2019re a small town,\u201d she said. \u201cIf 70 have already requested a ballot, that\u2019s half of a high turnout. I just don\u2019t want to see double effort on the part of the registrar\u2019s office and on the part of our voters.\u201d Four election officers said they would be willing to work the May 5 election in Scottsville, Washburne said. Three would be in the precinct, and one would be a greeter to help keep people separated as they wait to vote. Even with June elections pushed from June 9 to June 23 through a governor\u2019s order, Washburne said he\u2019s concerned the county may not have enough election officials, as almost 74% of Albemarle\u2019s election officers are between ages 60 and 90. Clarice Schermerhorn, the elections manager, has sent emails to all of the officials asking if they feel comfortable working the June election. \u201cI spoke to her yesterday and she said responses were starting to trickle in, and that it\u2019s been that many of them said, \u2018Yeah, we\u2019re, we\u2019re game,\u2019 it wasn\u2019t as if she\u2019s gotten an overwhelming number of thumbs down,\u201d he said. Washburne said his office also has sent emails to precinct facilities, and that the school division, which operates more than half of the polling places, has said it will be ready for June elections. \u201cThat will have to be something we\u2019ll have to work our way through, but so far, we\u2019re looking to be in pretty good shape on that,\u201d he said. Retaining elections Earlier this year, Gov. Northam approved a bill that allows the town council and mayoral seats to switch to staggered four-year terms. In this year\u2019s election, the mayor and the three town council candidates receiving the greatest number of votes will be elected for terms of four years, and the three town council candidates receiving the next greatest number of votes will be elected for two-year terms. Councilors had discussed moving elections from May to November, but opted to keep them in May. \u201cThe view on our council was that keeping them in May, as they had been, helped to focus on the local issues, that the folks who did come out would know that they were voting in a town election and know the people on the ballot and what was going on,\u201d Town Administrator Matt Lawless said. Candidates When Gill was asked if she would stay on as mayor if the elections were moved to November, she said she would let The Daily Progress know on July 1. \u201cWhen I ran two years ago, one of my campaign promises was two terms, and I\u2019m sticking to that,\u201d she said. \u201c...I\u2019ve done my time, and it\u2019s really now up to the next generation to step up and carry the banner.\u201d Smith, who served on Town Council from 2010 until 2016 and is currently a town planning commissioner, said he has many of the same goals as Gill and, if elected mayor, wants to work to continue some of her programs. \u201cNancy has been very active and worked really hard in the last two years on a project to get quality health care in rural areas ... and we need something down here,\u201d he said. \u201cThat would be the top priority.\u201d Smith, who writes for the Scottsville Monthly and has a quilting business, said it\u2019s also important to him that any development of vacant land and the former tire plant is well-thought-out and well-planned. \u201cI just have always felt like if you\u2019re going to be part of a community, you need to take an active part in that community,\u201d he said. Gritsko, who\u2019s been on the council for about 10 years, said he wants to continue to think about Scottsville\u2019s past, but also plan for the town\u2019s future. \u201cIn my mind, I want Scottsville to be the best small town in America and what does that look like to do that and I\u2019m excited that part of what I\u2019ve been able to do as a town council over the last 10 years has been involved in the green spaces in the town,\u201d he said. He\u2019s been heavily involved in the Van Clief Nature Area, and has future hopes for the park. \u201cThere\u2019s just so many other aspects of the park that we could do,\u201d Gritsko said. \u201cThere\u2019s also a trail that we hope to build that\u2019s called Overlook Trail which would be an enormous asset to the town.\u201d Bullock, a history and social sciences teacher at Charlottesville High School, said he decided to run again because he thinks it\u2019s important to have an impact on his immediate community. \u201cI feel like the work that we\u2019ve done over the last two years with the current council has been really great, and I just want to continue doing that work,\u201d he said. \u201cI think being a part of whatever recovery has to happen after the pandemic, there\u2019s going to be some important decisions to make within our own powers about how to help and make sure that the town stays vibrant.\u201d Mellusi, the art general administrative supervisor in the McIntire Department of Art at the University of Virginia, said one of the reasons she wants to stay on council is to work on collaboration and communication with leadership in the surrounding counties. \u201cA specific example is, you know, getting the town council together with Albemarle County\u2019s Board of Supervisors and sharing priorities and seeing where there might be opportunities we can work more closely together versus being in our isolated conversations,\u201d she said. Munson, a community resource specialist at UVa, said he wants to be part of figuring out how to balance the history and growth of town. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at ways to keep our historical character while still bringing a few more people into town and making the town a bit more viable,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a really exciting time to be able to figure out how to move forward.\u201d Tocci, who owns a construction business, said he decided to run because he plans on putting down roots in Scottsville and sees a lot of potential. If elected, he said he wants to focus on volunteerism, community wellness and sustainable growth. \u201cI definitely want to see certain things happen in town and excited to have an opportunity to do that,\u201d he said. Payne and Thacker did not respond to requests for comment by press time, and Staton-Joyner could not be reached.","68":"They\u2019re science, safety and kindness mixed in with a whole lot of art and craft. Area sewing machines have been busy as crafters across Central Virginia create cloth face masks for friends, family, first responders and medical care givers. \u201cPeople were looking for something to do while they were inside and they heard about the face mask recommendations and they just started sewing,\u201d said Virginia State Trooper Anthony Clore, who delivered to nursing homes and hospitals the dozens of concoctions donated to Fork Union Baptist Church, where he serves as pastor. \u201cIt was just something that people in the area started doing for others,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s people doing nice things for each other.\u201d Although the masks are not proper personal protection, they are important in stopping the spread of the COVID-19-causing virus SARS-CoV-2 virus, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC even put a video tutorial, graphics and a pattern for making the masks on its website. A video with U.S. Surgeon General Jerome Adams demonstrates how to quickly create a mask with a bandana and rubber bands. The CDC, which had not recommended the masks prior to April 3, changed course after several studies showed the virus could remain airborne for hours in a closed space such as a living room and alive on metal and plastic for as long as three days. In a research update published Friday, CDC investigators said studies show persons not showing symptoms of COVID-19 could possibly pass the virus to others in normal conversation. \u201cSpeech and other vocal activities such as singing have been shown to generate air particles, with the rate of emission corresponding to voice loudness,\u201d the study showed. The virus, like the related virus that causes Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome and influenza viruses, is easily transmitted by sneezing and coughing. Touching the viral deposits and then touching your eyes, nose or mouth is an effective form of transmission. What makes the COVID-19 virus different is that it was detected in the air after simple conversation, according to the NIH studies. It\u2019s not known yet how much exposure to the virus is needed to catch COVID-19, known as the infectious dose. \u201cSpeaking is not as forceful of an action, but they found that the virus survived in the air for three hours,\u201d said Dr. Bill Petri, a professor with the University of Virginia School of Medicine who is studying aspects of the virus, including working to find a vaccine. \u201cTalking with your neighbor six feet away from each other while outside is a lot safer than bringing the neighbor into your house and talking six feet away. In a short time, the room could, in theory, become toxic,\u201d Petri said. The virus\u2019 ability to stay adrift made the CDC recommend masking. \u201cThat it can stay in the air for so long makes wearing masks so important, even if it\u2019s just a handkerchief. When you wear a mask you are protecting someone else and they are protecting you,\u201d he said. Kim Dylla, the creative force behind Kylla Custom Rock Wear, a Charlottesville small business that makes stage clothes for international rock stars and wrestlers, found herself with free time after the pandemic canceled tours and shows. She decided to sew masks for local health care workers but figured she could encourage the wearing of masks by creating masks in the same heavy metal motif as her stage wear. \u201cTours and shows are canceled and I wanted to find a way to both keep our small business alive and use our talents and resources to help the community,\u201d Dylla said. \u201cI came up with the idea to sew masks for health care workers, but also make fashion masks in our unique post-apocalyptic style.\u201d With a degree in digital art and computer science, the UVa Echols Scholar designed the masks for placement of filtering devices and chose materials best suited to protection. She donates masks to healthcare workers who may order using a special promo code on her website, kyllacustomrockwear.com. \u201cI did my science homework on materials and construction, and I make all that information transparent in a video in our listings along with a tutorial so others can make safer masks and help their own communities,\u201d Dylla said. \u201cBy making the fashion masks, we promote mask-wearing among the general public so that people can keep their droplets to themselves while looking like movie villains.\u201d The proceeds are used to fund the materials to make free masks for health care workers, she said. \u201cSo far we have shipped hundreds of these and I hope that the health heroes who wear them feel safer,\u201d she said. \u201cWe will continue to use our resources to churn out more masks, and it has been a privilege to be able to help out in this time of need.\u201d","69":"New statistical models of COVID-19 cases in Virginia show calls for social distancing and closing of public places has slowed the spread of the disease and could push the pandemic\u2019s peak into the summer. The models, designed by the University of Virginia Biocomplexity Institute, in cooperation with other agencies across the country, show that continued social distancing measures could lower the peak number of cases and keep hospitals from being overwhelmed by COVID-19 patients. The models show that keeping the restrictions in place until June 10 could push the peaks into late July or August. Gov. Ralph Northam touted the new models in a news briefing on Monday and said he plans to continue ordered closings for some businesses. He said the restrictions could be expected to continue for the near future. Bryan Lewis, a professor and researcher with the UVa institute, said statistics related to cellphone tracking and other information gathered by Google and Cuebiq, which store and tabulate data, show Virginians largely have been following orders. Lewis discussed the model and how it works during an hour-long video briefing prior to Northam\u2019s update. According to the data, Google reported a 44% decrease in retail and recreation use among Virginians, an 18% drop in trips to grocery stores and a 39% decrease in travel to workplaces. Cuebiq showed a 50% reduction in individual travel compared with last year\u2019s average. The Virginia-based model shows the efforts have reduced the number of virus cases and decreased the number of people one person with the virus on average would infect. That should ease the threat of overwhelmed hospitals, officials said. \u201cOur social distancing efforts seem to be working. Under these current conditions, Virginia, as a whole, should have sufficient medical resources for at least the next couple of months,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cOther things the model shows us is that lifting social distancing restrictions too soon, without alternative ways to address and contain the infection, may lead to a quick second-wave [of cases].\u201d Northam cited the models in the later COVID-19 briefing as a reason for extending social distancing requirements. There was some confusion among business owners and state officials if the restrictions on certain businesses such as hair salons, barber shops and recreation-related businesses would expire April 23 or June 10. \u201cAs of right now, we\u2019re looking at our [COVID-19] peak being the latter part of April or early part of May and we will extend that order for people not to go into businesses and for those businesses to be closed,\u201d Northam said, speaking specifically of recreation, restaurants, hair salons and other areas of public gathering. \u201cI know businesses need to know [the dates]. I know it will need to be extended, but I don\u2019t know for how long,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll make that announcement on Wednesday.\u201d COVID-19 is the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2, a previously unknown virus that jumped from infecting animals to humans. Because humans have no immunity to the virus, there is no vaccine or treatment known for the disease it causes. COVID-19 cases can range from extremely mild to where the person infected feels no symptoms, to high fevers, pneumonia and extreme fatigue. The disease can result in acute respiratory distress syndrome, which occurs when fluid builds up in the tiny, elastic air sacs, or alveoli, in the lungs. The fluid keeps the lungs from filling with enough air, which means less oxygen reaches the bloodstream, depriving organs of the oxygen they need to function. Often a mechanical breathing device, a ventilator, is needed to prevent a person from dying from the syndrome. COVID-19 can cause a sudden spike of people suffering the syndrome and overwhelm hospitals with more patients than ventilators. Models before social distancing was put in place in March indicated that Virginia\u2019s patient peak would be later this month or early in May. The UVa model, which uses similar data-generation techniques as models the agency has created and implemented for the U.S. Department of Defense, predicts the peak in July or August, providing the state continues to keep stay-at-home orders in place until June 10. The longer the orders are in place, the lower the peaks and the further into the summer the peak occurrence is postponed, the models show. Lewis likened the social mitigation steps to driving a car on the freeway. Having no restrictions and letting the virus take its course is like \u201cpressing the pedal to the metal.\u201d Some efforts at social distancing are like slowly accelerating, he said. To pause the growth \u2014 as the models show current efforts have done \u2014 is like putting the virus on cruise control so that cases grow, but at a slow and steady rate. \u201cWe are at a cruising speed, you\u2019re on the cruise control, you\u2019re at a steady speed and you will get there when you get there,\u201d he said. Lewis said the models show that each person infected with the virus before March 15 likely infected an estimated 2.2 people. That number dropped to 1.1 people infected by each infected person after social distancing rules were laid out. Because the models are based on Virginia statistics at the municipal level and upward to the state level, the models provide better information for setting state policies, said Virginia\u2019s secretary of health and human resources, Dr. Daniel Carey. \u201cWe can use these models to form general conclusions to help the governor make policy decisions,\u201d he said. \u201cSocial distancing is important and it\u2019s working in Virginia. We\u2019re in it for the long haul and we need Virginians to keep working with us on this.\u201d During his briefing, Northam said the information supports keeping social distancing restraints in place. \u201cIf we lift the stay-at-home order too soon, if we try and rush to get our lives back to normal, the number of cases will spike higher and earlier. We can\u2019t afford that. We need to keep doing what we\u2019re doing.\u201d Northam said. \u201cI know it can feel like we\u2019ve already endured the restrictions brought by this epidemic for a long time and we are going to need to keep living this way for the near future,\u201d he said. \u201cThe key is to keep doing what we\u2019re doing. Stay home, stay away from groups and wash your hands.\u201d","70":"RICHMOND \u2014 Roughly three in four Virginians approve of Gov. Ralph Northam\u2019s handling of the coronavirus pandemic, according to a new Virginia Commonwealth University poll. The poll, conducted by the Center for Public Policy at the L. Douglas Wilder School of Government and Public Affairs at VCU, showed that 76% of those surveyed said Northam, a doctor by trade, was handling the public health crisis well. Northam made Virginia one of the first two states to close schools for the rest of the academic year when he extended his closure order beyond the initial two weeks on March 23 and the state\u2019s stay-at-home order, announced a week later, extends to June, one of the latest such orders in the country. The survey of 812 Virginians was conducted via phone between March 25 and April 8. It has a margin of error of plus or minus 4.51 percentage points for all adults and 5.68 percentage points for likely voters. Northam, a Democrat, has support from Republicans (68%), independents (70%) and Democrats (90%), according to the poll. The Richmond region\u2019s 78% support figure is in line with the governor\u2019s statewide favorability. The same poll found that 50% of Virginians strongly or somewhat approve of how President Donald Trump is handling the crisis, while 48% strongly or somewhat disapprove. Much of that support (83%) comes from Republicans, while 79% of Democrats disapprove of Trump\u2019s crisis response. \u201cTrump\u2019s 50% approval rating relative to the COVID-19 handling is his strong personal appeal with his base, and could be the hidden magnet amongst the electorate,\u201d said Wilder, the former Virginia governor. The VCU poll also reported that likely Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden leads Trump by 10 percentage points among likely voters in Virginia. The number of confirmed coronavirus outbreaks in Virginia eclipsed 100 on Tuesday, the majority of which remain in long-term care facilities. The Virginia Department of Health reported Tuesday that there are 102 outbreaks in the state, up from 97 on Monday. Fifty-six of those outbreaks are in long-term care facilities, including Canterbury Rehabilitation & Healthcare Center in Henrico County, where 84 residents and 35 health care workers had tested positive, as of Monday. An outbreak, according to the state health department\u2019s definition, occurs when there are at least two laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases connected by people, place and time. The uptick comes as the number of confirmed virus patients who have been hospitalized and discharged increased by nearly two-thirds since Monday. That\u2019s according to the Virginia Hospital and Healthcare Association, which started reporting the figure Monday. According to the organization\u2019s COVID-19 dashboard, 721 people have been discharged \u2014 up from 467 on Monday. VHHA also reported that 1,282 people with confirmed or pending COVID-19 tests are hospitalized, which is roughly 300 more than the 978 reported by the state health department. The two data dashboards have consistently had different hospitalization figures since the hospital organization started releasing data last week. Roughly one in three of the hospitalized COVID-19 patients are in the intensive care unit, according to the VHHA, and a little more than one in five are on ventilators. The Henrico health district has the most hospitalizations (40) in the Richmond region, according to the state health department. It\u2019s home to the Canterbury skilled nursing facility in the western part of the county, which has been hit harder by the virus than all but one nursing facility in the U.S. The Richmond region\u2019s 19 outbreaks still trail only Northern Virginia for the most in the state. The Virginia Department of Health reported Tuesday that 6,171 people in Virginia have tested positive for COVID-19 and 154 people have died as a result of the virus. That\u2019s an increase of 424 cases from the 5,747 reported Monday. The VDH also said that 42,763 have been tested for the virus in Virginia and 978 have been hospitalized. New modeling by UVA researchers that was made public Monday suggests social distancing policies are slowing the spread of COVID-19 in Virginia. The projections also point to a mid-August peak for new cases in the commonwealth. Locally, the Thomas Jefferson Health District reported 185 cases in the region it covers: 53 in Albemarle County, 34 in Charlottesville, 62 in Fluvanna County due to an outbreak at a long term care facility, four cases in Greene County, 27 in Louisa County and five in Nelson County. Yesterday, the TJHD announced that they would release data every Monday, Wednesday and Friday. The health department encouraged residents to check out the updated VDH website with more state and district-level data. On March 19, state health officials said there\u2019s a lag in the reporting of statewide numbers on the VDH website. Figures on the website might not include cases or deaths reported by individual localities or local health districts. - Paul Whelan","71":"The University of Virginia on Tuesday announced it would freeze hiring and salaries and institute pay cuts for leadership as the university wrestles with coronavirus-created financial impacts of shuttered classes, canceled celebrations and refunds to students. The school will try to avoid layoffs, furloughs or job cuts as long as possible, officials said. Also on Tuesday, Gov. Ralph Northam said that Virginia\u2019s state income in March was robust but that April\u2019s income would likely be a bust. He predicted tax revenues will fall during the social distancing orders and the state\u2019s coffers could lose about $1 billion. UVa\u2019s announcement came the day after the Board of Visitors met in an executive session to discuss the financial impacts of COVID-19, the pandemic disease caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2. The board also met behind closed doors on March 30 to discuss the financial impacts on the UVa Health System and medical center as well as the academic and business sides of the school. The health system has been hard hit due to the freeze of elective surgeries and the closing of clinics to meet social distancing requirements, officials said. University officials did not release figures regarding the school\u2019s financial losses. They did say that the university has \u201calready suffered major financial losses in its academic division and UVa Health [System]\u201d and \u201cexpects more revenue shortfalls from all of its funding sources, including tuition, state funding, clinical care, research grants, endowment returns and philanthropy.\u201d \u201cThe challenges presented by this crisis are difficult to exaggerate,\u201d UVa President Jim Ryan said in a letter to the university community. \u201cThe pandemic has not simply made fulfilling our core mission more difficult. It also has had, and continues to have, serious financial consequences for the university.\u201d The letter also was signed by Provost Liz Magill; Executive Vice President for Health Affairs Dr. K. Craig Kent; and Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer J.J. Davis. Actions announced Tuesday include freezing the hiring of open faculty, staff and health system positions with approval of executive leadership; a freeze on merit increases for the next fiscal year, beginning July 1; and the cutting or elimination of all non-essential expenses. UVa\u2019s executive leadership team \u2014 Ryan, Magill, Davis and Kent \u2014 will take a 10% salary reduction, the school announced. An estimate of the savings created by the executive pay cut was not immediately available. In a memo to university leaders, officials said capital projects already in design or under construction with full funding would continue. Other projects will be reevaluated and funding will need to be reestablished before work proceeds. New feasibility or design studies will be put off. Ryan wrote that the university will try to avoid shedding employees. \u201cWe remain committed to avoiding furloughs or layoffs for as long as possible and to utilizing them only if absolutely necessary\u201d Ryan wrote. \u201cThat said, the health system may have no choice but to turn to these steps sooner rather than later given the serious financial situation they are facing because of the significant disruption to clinical care.\u201d Ryan and his management team said in the letter that the financial future\u2019s forecast is mostly cloudy. \u201cWhile the full costs are not yet known, they are large and will grow over the next few months, especially in the health system,\u201d the letter states. \u201cAt the same time, the economy and financial markets remain volatile, and there is a good chance of a sustained economic downturn.\u201d Ryan wrote that the university and its employees need to prepare for further disruptions. \u201cFor all of those reasons, we are going to have to tighten our belts, just like other organizations and universities across the country. We also have to be prepared to absorb additional disruptions to our operations and finances, especially if we cannot resume normal operations next fall,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAlthough we hope to restart normally in the fall, it is still too early to know if that will be possible.\u201d UVa took early steps when the pandemic became imminent, shutting down classes and moving courses online for the rest of the spring semester and through the summer as well as canceling graduation-related events and exercises. The school also gave prorated refunds to students to cover a portion of spring semester housing and dining costs those forced to vacate residence halls. Earlier this month, UVa created a $2 million emergency assistance fund for furloughed contract workers and UVa employees facing unexpected costs due to the crisis. UVA also contributed $1 million to the Charlottesville Area Community Foundation. \u201cThe global economic and public health impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has the potential to have the most disruptive consequences of any downturn any of us has experienced in our lifetimes, reshaping how the university undertakes its missions of teaching, research, service and patient care,\u201d UVa officials said in the memo to leadership. \u201cAs further implications come into focus, we may need to take additional steps.\u201d In Richmond, Northam said that payroll withholding and individual income tax payments began to slow at the end of March after he put stay-at-home orders into place. On a year-to-date basis, collections of the payroll withholding taxes that make up 62% percent of the state\u2019s general fund revenues increased 4.8%. Sales tax collections, about 17% of the general fund revenues, increased 8.4%. \u201cWhile March collections reflected our strong economy, April revenues will begin to reveal the effects of COVID-19 on payroll withholding and retail sales tax collections,\u201d Northam said. \u201cThe most important thing to focus on right now is the health and safety of all Virginians, and we expect the April results will be disappointing.\u201d \u201cWith the COVID-19 outbreak affecting employment and businesses, payroll withholding and retail sales tax will be closely monitored as we expect them to decline by approximately $1 billion in the final quarter of our fiscal year.\u201d said Secretary of Finance Aubrey Layne.","72":"When inside-the-box thinking doesn\u2019t cut it, you need to get out of it. Staff at the University of Virginia Medical Center threw away convention to find a way to extend the life of personal protective equipment in the face of the highly communicable and deadly virus, SARS-CoV-2. With a pandemic raging, staff across the center\u2019s departments worked to find ways of extending the life of protective gear as shortages of N-95 masks and other equipment used when treating patients grew critical in other parts of the country struck by COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus. Staff wound up playing McGyver with a robot designed to clean hospital rooms of virulent organisms, turning it into a virus-killing, gear-cleaning, ultraviolet ray gun called Tru-D. There was a need for speed. Dr. Carlene Muto, assistant professor of infectious diseases and international health, had been on a trip to Italy with her daughter when the pandemic began to ravage that country. \u201cWe got out in the nick of time and I started thinking, \u2018What\u2019s going to happen when it gets here?\u2019\u201d Muto recalled. \u201cFor us, the problem was not the protective gloves or gowns but the masks. There are different types and people who fit in one type can\u2019t necessarily fit into another,\u201d she said. \u201cNormally, we don\u2019t reuse them but when there\u2019s a shortage of them around the world and the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] is putting out advice on reusing them, we knew we had to address it.\u201d With advance warning, Muto said medical center management was willing to get behind anything that could make supplies last longer. There were options. Some hospitals use a hydrogen peroxide electrostatic misting device to kill resistant bacteria and pathogens in patients\u2019 rooms and have modified that to kill the new coronavirus. But, according to industry research, proper use of the equipment takes time, training and calibration. \u201cThen there was ultraviolet light,\u201d Muto said. \u201cIt\u2019s been used in health care for decades. We were already using it to disinfect equipment.\u201d In her previous stint at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Muto had seen equipment like the robot used to disinfect patient rooms. The robot\u2019s name, Tru-D, is short for Total Room Ultraviolet Disinfection. The robot is effective at killing various organisms including Clostridioides difficile, typically known as C. diff., an antibiotic-resistant bug that can cause severe illness and even death and often is caught while in a hospital. Tru-D\u2019s operation seems simple. It stands in the room\u2019s center, using sensors to calibrate the exact dose of energy necessary to disinfect the entire room. It turns on its light. The light is reflected back so all surfaces receive the right amount of power. You can\u2019t see it happen, but the high-energy light is absorbed in the cellular RNA and DNA of microorganisms, damaging nucleic acids to prevent them from reproducing. Pretty much neutered, the organisms no longer can infect humans and die without replicating. Muto met with others and discussed the options. If Tru-D could kill the coronavirus in a room, could it kill the virus on protective gear within a room? \u201cWe were using it in Pittsburgh to disinfect patients\u2019 rooms,\u201d Muto said. \u201cSome of those gizmos can be set to a high level of energy and kill C. diff spores, which are hard to do. We had some UV machines here, but they didn\u2019t have the 360-degree sensors needed to clean a whole room. It seemed like it would be the easiest to just drop into place.\u201d What normally would have taken a while to propose, study, arrange, purchase, deliver and set up was accomplished in a very short time. \u201cOur leadership was on it and they understood the issue and how little time we had to act,\u201d Muto said. \u201cWe have been pushed to a place where merely purchasing the best products is no longer an option because there are none to purchase. There is a worldwide shortage and hospitals and states and countries are trying to purchase gear. There has never been a more crucial time, or a need so great to become a thinker out of the box. We need to think, plan and do. \u201c And so they did. Epidemiology, clinical engineering, procurement, clinical staff, environmental services, supply chain staff, central sterile processing teams and senior leadership teams went to work. A classroom was repurposed for a sterilization chamber. Its surfaces were painted with reflective paint to increase Tru-D\u2019s efficiency. With a chamber in hand, engineers designed racks to go into the room that could hang gear at the right distance and angles to make sure no piece of virus would miss its dose of radiation. Special collection boxes were designed so that the masks could be brought to the sterilization chamber without shedding any virus along the way. Management then approved purchase of the 5-foot, 6-inch tall device. The problem was that it could take several weeks, like a dozen, to deliver. Channeling Radar O\u2019Reilly from the television show MASH, Muto reached out to a friend that could make it happen much quicker. \u201cIn Pittsburgh we had about 30 of those things in different hospitals and clinics so I knew someone at the company,\u201d she admitted. \u201cI talked to him and we were able to find one. Management quickly got us a purchase order and it was going to be shipped. Except that it would take three weeks.\u201d That, everyone agreed, was too long. \u201cThey said \u2018if you come and get it, you can have it now.\u2019 So we did,\u201d Muto mused. Michael Friesen, director of clinical engineering, and Patrick Headley, manager of clinical engineering professional services, grabbed the keys to the company plane and traveled to Tennessee to get training, get the machine and get home. \u201cThe robot is large, fragile and incredibly valuable, yet we needed to get it operational as quickly as possible,\u201d said Friesen. \u201cThis is truly an all-hands-on-deck situation, and every hour and day is important,\u201d Headley said. \u201cWe were on our way Monday morning, returned home that afternoon with Tru-D in hand and had the robot\u2019s UV light up and running by Tuesday afternoon.\u201d Set at maximum power, Tru-D can disinfect hundreds of masks with each 20-minute cycle. Total cycle time from prepping the prep masks to disinfection, recovery and repackaging for the frontline healthcare providers is a little less than an hour for about 6,000 masks a day. \u201cBy utilizing Tru-D, we can extend our current supply of personal protective equipment to meet the essential needs of our frontline faculty and staff,\u201d said Dr. K. Craig Kent, executive vice president for health affairs. \u201cUVa Health will continue to do all we can, from supply chain management to clinical innovations, to ensure every person in our facilities is safe and protected.\u201d Muto said she is proud to have played a role in the innovative, off-the-cuff and out-of-the-box thinking that put the medical center ahead of a potentially life-threatening problem. \u201cIt\u2019s the kind of thinking we need right now. We have never in our lives been faced with anything like this and drastic times require drastic measures,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s really forced people to be innovative thinkers. There has never been a time where the need was so great. I\u2019m proud of the people here. We don\u2019t wait. We get it done. I\u2019m proud to be part of that.\u201d","73":"A letter written by Rep. Donald McEachin, D-4th, asks congressional leaders for $47 billion more in emergency funding, saying that steps colleges have taken, including issuing housing and dining refunds and moving classes online, among other things, \u201chave helped save lives\u201d but have \u201ccome at a significant financial cost.\u201d The money would be roughly three times larger than the funding package federal lawmakers approved for colleges across the country in March. The letter was sent to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer on Thursday. In it, McEachin and Reps. Don Beyer, D-8th, Jennifer Wexton, D-10th, and Gerry Connolly, D-11th, say colleges are having \u201cunprecedented cash flow challenges\u201d and those institutions \u201canticipate drastic decreased summer and fall enrollment as a result of this global pandemic.\u201d \u201cAbsent significant additional financial support from Congress, many institutions will face the prospect of immediate layoffs, devastating budget cuts, program eliminations, and possible closures,\u201d the letter reads. \u201cThe challenges these institutions are facing have impacts beyond their campuses: colleges and universities are often the largest employers in communities and drivers of local economies, including through innovative research and development.\u201d The letter offers some insight into the estimated impact the pandemic will have on Virginia colleges\u2019 budgets. Virginia Commonwealth University is projecting $50 million in lost revenue, with at least $13 million mostly due to refunds and credits to students, while Virginia Tech is estimating a $31.5 million impact for the spring semester. The University of Virginia is anticipating $20 million in losses from housing and dining rebates, according to the letter, while the College of William & Mary projects a financial impact between $13 million and $32 million because of refunds for tuition and room and board, and for spending more on technology related to virtual learning. Virginia State University, a historically black college, is expecting a roughly 25% drop in enrollment, the letter says. Another HBCU, Virginia Union University, is projecting $20 million to $27 million in financial losses related to housing, dining, cuts in research and an expected drop in enrollment. \u201cDirect federal funding is desperately needed to help these institutions address revenue losses and expenses resulting from the COVID-19 crisis,\u201d McEachin and others said. Colleges in the state have already taken some steps to help with the financial crisis, including instituting hiring freezes and eliminating discretionary spending. A planned tuition freeze state lawmakers approved last month, where the state gives schools the money they would have gotten had they raised tuition, is unlikely as a new state budget that lawmakers will take up next week focuses on the pandemic\u2019s fallout. In a statement, VCU\u2019s chief financial officer, Karol Kain Gray, thanked the members of Congress for \u201cpushing for more federal support for higher education during this unprecedented time.\u201d \u201cWe cannot allow our students and health care workers to bear the brunt of the economic impact of this pandemic,\u201d she said. \u201cAdditional federal support is critical so that we can continue with our public mission of educating Virginia\u2019s students, caring for Virginia\u2019s patients and, as Richmond\u2019s largest employer, serving the Richmond region as an economic engine.\u201d Virginia colleges are already set to receive $313 million as part of the federal funding package Congress approved last month. The money is being sent to schools through the Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund, a $14 billion pot that Congress established as part of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act. Half of the roughly $12.6 billion given in direct grants to colleges nationwide must go straight to students through emergency financial aid, according to the legislation. The $156.5 million that is set to head to Virginia students will help cover costs associated with the widespread closure of the state\u2019s colleges, including food, health care and technology, among other things, with classes moving online. \u201cThis critical funding will help colleges and universities provide Virginia students with the support they need during this unprecedented time,\u201d Virginia\u2019s U.S. senators, Tim Kaine and Mark R. Warner, both Democrats, said in a joint statement. \u201cWe are pleased to see these resources go towards helping provide emergency financial aid for Virginia students, and we will keep fighting for the additional resources our educational institutions need in a future package.\u201d George Mason University students are set to receive the most money in the state, with $10.4 million going to the financial aid grants. Students at VCU will split $10.1 million.","74":"On Monday, the Thomas Jefferson Health District confirmed the number of COVID-19 cases in Fluvanna had grown from 17 to 62 over the weekend due largely to an outbreak at the Envoy at the Village, a long-term care facility in Fork Union. The number of cases has since grown to 68, according to updated data from the health district. According to a Thursday news release from Fluvanna County, the Envoy is coordinating efforts with TJHD, Sentara Martha Jefferson Hospital, the University of Virginia, the Northwest Regional Healthcare Coalition and Fluvanna County Emergency Management to take care of patients, share equipment and trace contact with the virus, among other efforts. \u201cWe are working hard with many community partners to prevent further spread of COVID-19 throughout this facility and our entire health district, including Fluvanna County,\u201d TJHD Director Dr. Denise Bonds said in the release. \u201cUnfortunately, COVID-19 is spreading throughout our communities, so it is important that people follow our recommendations for staying home as much as possible to avoid getting sick.\u201d According to the release, arrangements have been made with transport agency Delta Response Team to transport any residents who become symptomatic and need additional medical care. The health district and UVa coordinated testing for all residents and staff at the Envoy at the Village, including those who were not showing symptoms at the time of testing, according to the release. \u201cTesting all staff and residents was important for TJHD to understand the spread of COVID-19 within the facility and to minimize risk to those who do not have COVID-19,\u201d the release reads. Kathryn Goodman, a spokeswoman for TJHD, said that to protect privacy, the state health department is not sharing how many tests were conducted, how many individuals at Envoy tested positive and whether any deaths had occurred at the facility. \u201cVDH is required by the Code of Virginia to keep the identity of reported cases anonymous unless the State Health Commissioner makes an exception to meet a public health need,\u201d Goodman said. \u201cGiven the relatively small number of COVID-19 deaths per locality, releasing this information could lead easily to individuals being identified and, thus, deny them the confidentiality afforded them by Virginia law.\u201d She reiterated the need for safety practices \u2014 namely, staying at home, social distancing, hand hygiene and wearing a cloth face covering when making necessary trips \u2014 to help slow the spread of COVID-19. Envoy did not respond to requests for comment Thursday. As of Thursday, there have been 6,889 COVID-19 cases in Virginia.","75":"Last month, when the University of Virginia announced the end of regular, in-person classes for the rest of the school year, one change hit many students particularly hard: the loss of Final Exercises on the Lawn. At the time, UVa officials said that while May graduation ceremonies could not go forward \u201cas currently planned,\u201d they were exploring options. On Friday, UVa announced \u2014 tentatively \u2014 that Class of 2020 graduations will take place Oct. 9-11, indicating hope that the novel coronavirus pandemic will have abated by then. If, however, COVID-19 is still prevalent, another rain date will be May 28-30, 2021, the weekend following the Class of 2021\u2019s Final Exercises. \u201cThis year\u2019s Final Exercises will be different in some respects from the ones we had originally planned, and had been looking forward to,\u201d President Jim Ryan wrote in an email Friday. \u201cBut we will do everything we can to make these ceremonies a fitting end to your time at UVa. While every class at UVa is special, yours is truly unique \u2014 and these Final Exercises will be, too.\u201d An October date may allow students, families and area businesses time to prepare for a reappearance in Charlottesville, but university officials cautioned against making plans just yet. \u201cWe recommend against making travel plans for October until we know more information regarding COVID-19 and the impact to the university\u2019s fall operations,\u201d they wrote on an FAQ page. UVa also plans to hold a virtual ceremony on the original 2020 graduation date of May 16 to confer degrees, marking the official date of graduation and ensuring fourth-years graduate \u201con time,\u201d according to Ryan\u2019s email. Schools and departments aim to hold their own ceremonies as well, Ryan wrote, with details to be shared online as they are worked out. UVa already has moved the first half of its summer session, and has said it will make a decision about summer classes, events and conferences occurring after June 30 by June 1. UVa has said it intends to be open for in-person classes in the fall, but officials are still weighing options.","76":"RICHMOND \u2014 On Tuesday, state Sen. Amanda Chase, the only declared Republican candidate for Virginia governor in 2021, took to Facebook Live to warn supporters that Gov. Ralph Northam might be using University of Virginia COVID-19 models to justify extending his shutdown orders into August. That prediction \u2014 delivered via a video viewed more than 400,000 times \u2014 turned out to be incorrect. On Wednesday, Northam said he was extending mandatory closures for certain types of businesses by two weeks, setting a new expiration date of May 8. In a Facebook post Wednesday night, Chase told followers she was glad her theory didn\u2019t pan out and suggested the governor may have sensed a backlash coming from Virginians who \u201cwant to get back to work.\u201d \u201cI think it\u2019s time to put pressure on him, and say May 8th is it,\u201d she said. As Virginia enters its second month of social distancing, Republicans are becoming increasingly vocal about calling for a plan to reopen the economy, signaling an initial period of bipartisan consensus over how to manage the crisis may be coming to an end. Northam, the only medical doctor serving as governor of any state, has showed no signs of changing course, saying he\u2019s following the advice of health experts and responding to data showing that lifting social distancing rules too quickly would put more people in danger. The governor\u2019s stay-at-home order asking Virginians to avoid leaving the house is still scheduled to be in effect until June 10. As the Northam administration continues to confront the public health crisis, Republican General Assembly leaders are beginning to press for a plan to get business moving again. \u201cVirginia can\u2019t go on like this,\u201d Senate Republican leaders said in a statement responding to the governor\u2019s extension of his order banning large gatherings and closing restaurant dining rooms, gyms, theaters, hair salons and barber shops and other businesses. \u201cFor the sake of our state\u2019s economy and the quality of life of all Virginians, we need to prepare for a safely \u2018Reopened Virginia\u2019 as soon as possible.\u201d Opponents of the governor\u2019s shutdown policies have been using social media to try to organize protests. The first one, held outside the Executive Mansion on Thursday, was sparsely attended, with only a few dozen people gathering to hold signs and picnic with their families. Other demonstrations at statehouses this week drew bigger crowds. The Associated Press reported that the protests coincide with a push to reopen the economy \u201cbeing influenced and amplified by a potent alliance of big money business interests, religious freedom conservatives and small-government activists.\u201d After the protest in Richmond began, police closed the gates to Capitol Square, blocking a small group from entering. Capitol Police, who had a heavy presence and urged those gathering to maintain six feet of distance between each other or face a summons, deferred questions about the closure to the Department of General Services. Chase had mentioned Thursday\u2019s protest on her Facebook page. She said she might get involved in a more organized protest effort depending on what Northam chooses to do. \u201cIf he had extended it into August, I would\u2019ve joined right in there in protest against it,\u201d Chase said. \u201cIf I\u2019m going to protest, you\u2019ll know it.\u201d At his briefing Wednesday, Northam said data shows the state\u2019s social distancing measures are helping slow the spread of COVID-19. But with new modeling prepared by scientists from UVa\u2019s Biocomplexity Institute cautioning against lifting social distancing rules in the near future, Northam said it\u2019s too soon to talk about returning to old ways of living. \u201cWhen people say that it\u2019s time to stop what we\u2019re doing and get back to normal, they\u2019re wrong,\u201d Northam said. \u201cIf we let off the brakes and try to go back to the way things were, we\u2019ll get another spike of cases that could overwhelm our hospitals.\u201d A recent Virginia Commonwealth University poll found a 76% approval rating for Northam\u2019s handling of the coronavirus pandemic, with about 70% of Republicans and independents indicating either slight or strong approval. Around 90% of Democrats approve of the governor\u2019s performance, the poll found. Medical experts broadly support the continuation of social distancing rules to limit the spread of the virus. Dr. Tom Yackel, president of MCV Physicians at VCU, described the pandemic as a wildfire and social distancing as the only tool officials have to fight the flames. \u201cIf we lift those measures, the fire will just pick up where it left off. We\u2019ll turn on the fans,\u201d Yackel said. \u201cAnd for a while, it will seem like everything\u2019s great. But then you\u2019ll see that curve start to go up because we haven\u2019t changed anything.\u201d In a statement Thursday, left-leaning advocacy group Progress Virginia called the Republican rhetoric \u201cnothing short of reckless,\u201d saying it threatens \u201cthe health and safety of Virginia families.\u201d In an interview Thursday, former Gov. George Allen, a Republican tapped to serve on a coronavirus recovery commission convened by the conservative Heritage Foundation, said he\u2019s hoping to bring \u201cconcepts of proportionality and balance\u201d to the question of how states can begin to gradually reopen. \u201cWe just can\u2019t be paralyzed by fear,\u201d said Allen, who served as governor from 1994 to 1998 and went on to serve in the U.S. Senate. General social distancing should continue even after society starts to reopen, Allen said, and stricter measures will probably be necessary to continue to protect vulnerable populations like nursing home residents. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be slow,\u201d Allen said. \u201cBut the sooner it gets moving, in my view, the better, with the proper protocols. I\u2019m not saying you ought to open up everything tomorrow or next week.\u201d Rural areas that seem to have been spared the brunt of the virus, he said, could potentially start back up before regions with more density and more COVID-19 cases. \u201cI would not hold the whole state back if there\u2019s large areas and communities that look relatively safe and with the proper protocols can reopen,\u201d Allen said. It won\u2019t do any good, he said, to turn the issue of when and how to reopen into a partisan fight. State lawmakers will get their first formal chance to shape the state\u2019s coronavirus response next week when the General Assembly meets for the first time since adjourning its regular business session March 12. On Wednesday, the House and Senate will be meeting in different locations in Richmond after legislative leaders decided that going to work in the Capitol\u2019s two chambers was unsafe. The House is expected to meet outside the Capitol building. The Senate will convene at the Science Museum of Virginia. House members are being encouraged to wear masks, wash their hands and stay at least six feet away from their colleagues\u2019 desks. In interviews, several Republican lawmakers were quick to note they aren\u2019t advocating for doing away with social distancing altogether or ignoring guidelines issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Sen. Ryan McDougle, R-Hanover, chairman of the Senate Republican Caucus, said his office has been inundated with calls from people telling him they\u2019re \u201con the brink of going out of business\u201d and can\u2019t last until June. \u201cIf we\u2019re saying social distancing works in the public and you can go to the grocery store, buy liquor or go to Home Depot, what is the difference in saying that you can\u2019t do that in the other establishments that the government has mandated to close?,\u201d McDougle said. \u201cLet\u2019s give them the tools to be responsible and stay open.\u201d Northam\u2019s executive actions have been less strict than orders issued by other Democratic governors. He has not ordered mandatory shutdowns for non-essential businesses, saying workplaces he hasn\u2019t explicitly shut down can continue operating as long as they follow social distancing guidelines. Chase said that\u2019s led to inconsistencies in what\u2019s open and what\u2019s closed. As an example, she pointed to the mandatory closure of the Metro Richmond Zoo in her district. \u201cYou can do social distancing at the zoo,\u201d Chase said. \u201cWhy are we closing down a zoo but you can go play golf?\u201d Northam has said he\u2019s making decisions based on data that\u2019s changing every day. \u201cWe\u2019re going to need to keep living this way for the near future \u2026 The key is for us to keep doing what we\u2019re doing,\u201d the governor said at his Monday briefing. \u201cJust as soon as we can get people\u2019s lives back to normal, we will. But we also have to do it safely.\u201d","77":"Sgt. Joey Lewis is not coming to arrest you, Dominion Energy will not shut off your power and the IRS already knows everything about you and doesn\u2019t need to call for your personal information. Pandemic-caused closures, lockdowns, layoffs and a spate of Congress-approved economic stimuli are contributing to fear, anxiety and confusion \u2014 and making daily life just seem weird. And when the going gets weird, the fleecers, swindlers and flimflamming scammers turn pro. Schemes and frauds are taking a viral turn as crooks hook COVID-19 to con people out of money and personal information. Authorities from organizations including the IRS, the U.S. Secret Service and Dominion Energy are warning people to hang up, lock the door or hit delete on callers, visitors and emails that seem suspicious or are too good to be true. \u201cThis lockdown and the COVID-19 crises has been bad for 99.99% of our society, but for that one-thousandth of a percent who are working these scams, COVID-19 is manna from heaven in a big, gift-wrapped box,\u201d said Barry N. Moore, president of the Better Business Bureau of Central Virginia. \u201cSomething like [the pandemic] gives these people who work hard to steal your money a chance to really go to work,\u201d Moore said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to not get trapped. You have to be on your game every day.\u201d The bureau tracks scams on its website and shows nearly 100 different rip-off projects, from credit card pfishing to callers pretending to be from utility companies. They may even tell you they\u2019re with the city police and you\u2019re about to go to jail. \u201cOur most recent scam is someone posing to be Sgt. Joey Lewis or another [Charlottesville Police Department] officer threatening to arrest you unless you give them your bank account information and pay a $2,500 fine,\u201d said Tyler Hawn, spokesman for the department. \u201cThis is a scam, and we will never ask for your bank or credit card information over the phone or threaten arrest with a fine.\u201d Several area residents also have reported scammers trying to get them to pay their power bill over the phone with a credit card under threat of disconnection. The payment would be refunded \u201cafter an investigation.\u201d Dominion Energy officials said they are aware of the phone scammers trying to get customers to pay bills they may not even owe. \u201cScam artists are trying to take advantage of our customers during this difficult time,\u201d said Samantha Moore, with Dominion Energy. \u201cWe will never call demanding immediate payment or threaten to cut off power.\u201d Dominion officials, in an email, noted that they have agreed to not shut off power for nonpayment during the pandemic. Some people in Central Virginia have reported strangers dressed in shirts and ties and wearing ID badges knocking on their doors claiming to be making COVID-19 checks on the property. Scammers in Maine sent out text messages to people warning them that \u201csomeone who came into contact with you\u201d tested positive for COVID-19. The message includes a link that would possibly transmit a computer virus. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen much yet. We\u2019ve been posting a bunch of tips and alerts on our Facebook page,\u201d said Capt. David R. Wells, of the Fluvanna County Sheriff\u2019s Office. \u201cThe biggest thing is don\u2019t give out personal information on the phone or over email, don\u2019t cash checks that are over the amount \u2014 scammers will send fake checks for too much money and then want you to wire the rest back \u2014 and do nothing with wiring money or gift cards.\u201d The scammers aren\u2019t just working state and local angles \u2014 they\u2019re also pretending to work for almost every level of federal government. \u201cThe Federal Trade Commission is getting a lot of reports about fraudulent calls, texts and emails coming from people pretending to be from the Social Security Administration, IRS, Census Bureau, [Citizenship and Immigration Services] and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation,\u201d said Cristina Miranda, of the FTC. \u201cThese fake government messages might say that you\u2019re approved for money, can get quick relief payments, or get cash grants due to the coronavirus,\u201d she said. \u201cScammers might also promise you small-business loans, or send an alert that a check is ready to be picked up. These are all scams, and none of those messages come from a government agency.\u201d With $1,200 federal stimulus checks on the way from Congress to assist Americans during the crisis, scammers have found a wide variety of excuses to convince people to give out personal information, IRS officials said. \u201cScammers may ask an individual to sign over their economic impact payment check to them; ask for verification of personal or banking information; suggest that they can get someone a tax refund or payment faster by working on their behalf,\u201d officials said in an email. \u201cThe IRS will not call, email or text you to verify or request your financial, banking or personal information. Watch out for websites and social media attempts to request money or personal information,\u201d tax officials said. \u201cThe official website is IRS.gov.\u201d The Secret Service warned that tax-related scams are still popular this time of year. \u201cTax season, along with the latest COVID 19 scams, provide an ideal environment for criminals to take advantage of law-abiding citizens,\u201d said Melissa McKenzie, with the Secret Service. McKenzie noted that identity thieves will file fraudulent forms under a taxpayer\u2019s name and Social Security number to snag a return payment. Most times, the taxpayer has no idea the fraud has occurred until they file their own return. In 2019, an estimated 650,572 fraudulent tax returns were reported, costing the government about $2 billion. \u201cThis fraud is particularly malicious because the legitimate taxpayer may have no way of knowing that fraud has been committed,\u201d McKenzie said. \u201cThe scam only works for returns that haven\u2019t been filed by legitimate consumers, so criminals are highly motivated to file as early as possible.\u201d If residents should be be wary of door knocks, phone rings and emails, they also should be downright skeptical of social media quizzes and games, the Better Business Bureau of Central Virginia warns. Popular post games on Facebook, including supporting 2020 graduates who are missing their ceremonies by posting your own graduation picture, can put too much personal information where scammers can skim it, Moore said. \u201cThe quizzes ask a lot of questions that seem like fun \u2014 where you grew up, the name of your high school, your first car \u2014 but those are all security questions used by a lot of banks and financial businesses,\u201d Moore said. \u201cDon\u2019t let having a little idle social media fun turn into a nightmare from aiding in your identity being stolen.\u201d","78":null,"79":"Starting Monday, all patients and visitors the University of Virginia Medical Center and Health System facilities will be required to wear masks at all times.

About 2,500 fewer Virginians were tested for COVID-19 this past week compared to the week prior, according to data published by the Virginia Department of Health. Over the last seven days, the agency reported 13,932 new tests, a 15% dip from the 16,447 tests the week before.\u00a0 The lag of tests in Virginia matches a national decline in COVID-19 testing, a reality that clashes with statements from government and public health officials, who say that they need better data to chart a\u00a0course of action around the pandemic. Officials in Virginia acknowledged COVID-19 cases remain undercounted, while some private laboratories operating in Virginia and reached by the Times-Dispatch confirmed demand for their tests remained below their capacity. Public health officials and private lab administrators said the dip in testing might indicate physicians are requesting fewer tests because of narrow guidance coming from the state and federal governments on who should be tested. Testing guidelines sought to prioritize the sickest patients and those most at risk when testing was limited. As testing capacity has expanded with the entry of private labs, the guidance failed to keep up. Gov. Ralph Northam emphasized the need for testing Friday, just days after researchers at the University of Virginia projected that only 15% of COVID-19 cases in Virginia are being detected, a challenge in their work to better model the state\u2019s outlook. \u201cWe need adequate testing. We need to be able to test, we need to be able to track, and we need to be able to isolate individuals, looking at hot spots, knowing the trend of this pandemic and what this virus is doing,\u201d Northam said Friday. New federal guidelines on how states should go about easing public restrictions say states should only begin after a downward trajectory of new cases over a 14-day period. To use positive tests as an indicator, the guidance says, Virginia's testing volume would need to remain flat or increase over that time frame. With inconsistent testing rates in the state, it\u2019s unclear Virginia can determine when cases have started to decline. Public health officials in Virginia have not publicly shared a quantifiable testing goal, but on Friday, Health Secretary Dan Carey said: \"We want to get to significantly higher amounts, thousands more per day to accomplish the missions that the governor has outlined.\"\u00a0\u00a0 Virginia reported 2,934 new tests on Saturday, but fewer than 2,000 tests were reported on four days last week.\u00a0In neighboring Maryland, Gov. Larry Hogan said that the state hopes to reach 10,000 per day on its path to lifting public restrictions. The Northam administration has said it is studying the state's testing capacity, but during a Friday news conference, officials said they couldn't share updates on a survey of capacity at the state's private labs, which perform an overwhelming majority of the tests in Virginia. At the same time, they announced that the state\u2019s testing criteria for the public lab, which has a capacity of 200 tests per day, would be expanded in the coming days to include more people living and working in \u201ccongregate settings\u201d like nursing homes, prisons, jails and homeless shelters. \u201cThe goal is to expand public health testing,\u201d said Laurie Forlano, deputy commissioner of population health at the Virginia Department of Health. Virginia's lag in testing comes after weeks of overwhelming demand during the early stages of the pandemic that flooded\u00a0the few laboratories that were performing them. When Virginia first reported positive COVID-19 patients on March 8, the state laboratory had a daily capacity of fewer than 50 tests in a state with more than 8.5 million people. State officials said they were working to expand testing capacity amid a nationwide supply shortage, one that stemmed from limited capacity at the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the only entity with an approved test in the U.S. Private labs, and those within public and private hospitals, eventually developed their own tests, which now account for the bulk of results logged in Virginia. According to the Virginia Department of Health, eight private laboratories and four hospitals are currently able to test for COVID-19. Crystal Icenhour, the CEO of Aperiomics Inc. based in Ashburn, said her lab\u2019s testing capacity is roughly 2,500 tests per week, and \u201cwe\u2019re very far from maxing out that capacity.\u201d \u201cWe were surprised given the fact that current estimates say there are about 300 million tests needed to be performed in the U.S. Given that mass of volume, we expected to be turning groups away,\u201d she said. Icenhour said part of the reason for the decreased demand can be chalked up to the initial hubbub around testing, which saw exploding demand and very few tests that took days to complete. That experience, she said, left many physicians to turn instead to clinical diagnoses for patients with mild symptoms. State Health Commissioner Norman Oliver said many clinicians with patients showing COVID-19 symptoms may more quickly turn to a diagnosis based on their discretion instead of waiting days for the results of a test that could end up costing a patient $100 or more. \u201cIf I see you\u2019re showing symptoms \u2014 we\u2019re both pretty sure you have COVID-19 \u2014 I might just send you home, ask you to self-quarantine, watch your symptoms,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy would I saddle you with that expense? By the time the test comes back, it\u2019s been days and the direction is the same.\u201d Dissuading physicians from that scenario for the sake of public health will be a messaging task for state officials, he said. \u201cI\u2019m not blaming clinicians,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to educate and convince our providers to order these tests because we need them for public health.\u201d Of the labs reached by the Times-Dispatch, all said the cost of their tests was $51.31 for those covered by Medicare or a private insurance company, or around $100 out-of-pocket. Forlano said that the state\u2019s expanded testing criteria would cover people who are uninsured, allowing them to be tested for free through the state lab. Compounding the situation, Icenhour said, is strict guidance from the CDC and the state about who should be tested. For weeks, the list has included only those with multiple symptoms and who are in an at-risk category, like the elderly or those with pre-existing conditions. As testing capacity increased, the guidance to physicians remained the same. Kimberly Gorode, a spokeswoman for Quest Diagnostics, one of the biggest laboratories in the country, declined to provide state-level data but confirmed that nationally, demand for their tests has declined. Gorode said Quest is expanding outreach to health care providers, alerting them that the capacity exists to test lower-priority patients. Gorode said Quest, too, is advocating for the guidance around testing to be updated. \u201cWe also support the efforts of our trade association, [the American Clinical Laboratory Association] to collaborate with public health authorities to reconsider patient prioritization schemes that were essential to direct testing to highest-risk populations when industry test capacity was limited,\u201d she said in an email. Forlano said that the state\u2019s guidance doesn\u2019t limit physicians from ordering tests from private labs. On Monday, the Virginia Department of Health sent a notice to physicians advising them of the private labs that were accepting tests from patients in Virginia. Icenhour said that even when the guidance isn\u2019t binding, the message of limited testing is being followed by many physicians treating patients with milder symptoms. Bill Miller, the CEO of the Glen Allen-based lab GENETWORx, said in an email that his lab is only 70% toward meeting its capacity of 3,000 to 5,000 tests per week, though demand is increasing. Miller said that fewer than one-third of the tests it performs are for Virginia patients. Miller said his company is working with as many state institutions as it can, including Canterbury Rehabilitation and Healthcare, which has seen one of the deadliest COVID-19 outbreaks in a nursing home anywhere in the country. A spokesman for LabCorp, another major national laboratory that contracts with health care providers, declined to say whether the company was seeing a decline in demand for tests. He said the company can currently process 65,000 tests per day, and has tested 650,000 people since it rolled out its test on March 5. Without an approved vaccine, public health researchers say that widespread testing and monitoring remain the only path to a return to normality. In the meantime, the disease's outlook remains elusive. Madhav Marathe, a researcher at UVA's Biocomplexity Institute, which modeled COVID-19 in Virginia, said its model relies on the assumption that only one out of every seven Virginians infected with COVID-19 are being tested. Marathe said it's not a \"hard number,\" but rather, their best estimate based on evidence from here and elsewhere. \"These estimates are based on indirect information, because the testing is so sparse,\" he said. His team projected earlier this week that social distancing was slowing down the spread of the disease, but that a \"halfway\" return to normal public activity after June 10 could cause a spike and overwhelm the state's health care system by August. That could be avoided, and the models updated, with more testing and more tracing of infected patients, said Chris Barrett, the executive director of the UVA institute behind the new modeling.\u00a0 For now, he said, \"I don't think we should expect life to be completely normal for a while. There is no immediate way out. No vaccine, no therapeutic treatment. This is what there is. This is it.\"","81":"Exercise may reduce the risk of developing acute respiratory distress syndrome, a major cause of death in patients with COVID-19, according to a review from a University of Virginia professor. Zhen Yan, of the university\u2019s School of Medicine, has conducted a review of medical research findings that \u201cstrongly support\u201d the possibility that exercise can prevent or at least reduce the severity of ARDS, which affects between 3% and 17% of all patients with COVID-19. Research conducted prior to the pandemic suggested that approximately 45% of patients who d Zhen Yan evelop severe ARDS will die, according to the review. \u201cAll you hear now is either social distancing or ventilator, as if all we can do is either avoiding exposure or relying on a ventilator to survive if we get infected,\u201d Yan said in a news release from the university. \u201cThe flip side of the story is that approximately 80% of confirmed COVID-19 patients have mild symptoms with no need of respiratory support. The question is why. Our findings about an endogenous antioxidant enzyme provide important clues and have intrigued us to develop a novel therapeutic for ARDS caused by COVID-19.\u201d Yan, who is the director of the Center for Skeletal Muscle Research at UVa\u2019s Robert M. Berne Cardiovascular Research Center, compiled a review of existing medical research looking at an antioxidant known as \u201cextracellular superoxide dismutase.\u201d The antioxidant hunts down harmful free radicals, protecting tissues and helping to prevent disease, according to UVa\u2019s release. Muscles naturally make the antioxidant, secreting it into the circulation system to allow binding to other vital organs, but its production is enhanced by cardiovascular exercise, per Yan\u2019s review. According to Yan, research suggests that even a single session of exercise increases production of the antioxidant, prompting Yan to urge people to find ways to exercise even while maintaining social distancing. \u201cWe cannot live in isolation forever,\u201d he said. \u201cRegular exercise has far more health benefits than we know. The protection against this severe respiratory disease condition is just one of the many examples.\u201d","82":"The school is coordinating a drop-off location with the Charlottesville-UVa-Albemarle Regional Emergency Operations Center with assistance from the United Way of Greater Charlottesville.

The Charlottesville Regional Chamber of Commerce and economic offices at the University of Virginia, Albemarle County and the City of Charlottesville are launching Project Rebound to bring together the local business community, discuss the challenges of COVID-19\u2019s economic effects and seek solutions. Chamber President and CEO Elizabeth Cromwell said in a video press conference Tuesday that there are a lot of people in the community who are trying to help and businesses that are already trying to collaborate and partner. \u201cWe felt like we had an opportunity to bring all those ideas together, so that we\u2019re not duplicating efforts, hopefully, and that we\u2019re exploring ideas and best practices through some industry specific committees that we are inviting members of the business community to participate in,\u201d she said. Unemployment claim numbers hit their highest peak so far in Charlottesville and Albemarle the week of April 4, where the city had 985 claims and the county had 1,429 claims. Between the week of March 14 and April 11, Albemarle had a total of 3,978 claims filed, while Charlottesville had 3,029, according to numbers from the Virginia Employment Commission. The Project Rebound initiative has seven teams focused on specific industries and sectors, such as hospitality and tourism, IT, financial and defense and nonprofit and community organizations. Members of the local business community can join a team relevant to their experience. The project is open to all members of the business community, not just chamber members. Comments on best practices and ideas, challenges\/obstacles and opportunities can be submitted on the chamber\u2019s website. The teams will begin work immediately and will submit information to the steering committee by the end of May so findings can be shared with the business community before Gov. Ralph Northam\u2019s stay-at-home order expires in June. \u201cWe want to have some recommendations in the hands of the business community before that time, and depending on what those recommendations are \u2026 I think it\u2019s quite likely that we will take a deeper dive into some of those areas that we discover and come up with more recommendations for kind of a phase two, if you will,\u201d Cromwell said. UVa has been addressing the health care needs of the community, and President Jim Ryan has asked staff to continue looking for ways to partner with the community during this crisis, said Pace Lochte, the assistant vice president for economic development at UVa. \u201cWe recognize that we have a significant economic impact on the region and we really want to work with the business community to understand what it will take to get our region up and running again,\u201d Lochte said. Chris Engel, the director of Charlottesville\u2019s Office of Economic Development, said that the community has had a shock that nobody has endured before. \u201cThis pandemic has brought something to the forefront that we\u2019ve never seen before, essentially disconnecting the consumer from the rest of the economy, which has been fairly devastating across the country and across the world,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to work together to the extent that we can locally to help get that connection back together and do it safely, do it efficiently and hopefully we\u2019ll be better for it as we come out the other end.\u201d Cromwell said the name for the project was inspired by UVa men\u2019s basketball Coach Tony Bennett talking about adversity after his team won the NCAA national championship last year.

Ralph Northam on Thursday extended the state\u2019s ban on nonessential surgeries and procedures until May 1. The Virginia Hospital and Healthcare Association had asked the governor to allow the ban on nonessential surgeries and procedures to expire on Friday. CEO Sean Connaughton wrote in a letter to Northam that the hospitals have nearly 6,000 open beds and 2,200 unused ventilators. \u201cOnly 21% of the 2,865 ventilators available are in use by both COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients. Critically, these numbers have remained consistent since the end of March,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIn the meantime, it is estimated that 60,000 Virginians have had their non-urgent inpatient and outpatient medical procedures canceled over the past month and 15,000 procedures will be canceled every week going forward.\u201d Hospitals systems across Virginia and the nation have said they furloughed employees who worked in outpatient clinics, surgical suites and other services that were halted both to conserve masks, gowns and gloves that were in short supply, and to stop transmission of the virus. The health systems have also said they have taken huge financial hits by spending more to build capacity for COVID-19 and by forgoing revenue from nonessential services. Northam said in a news release that the ban on elective surgeries will continue while he and the state health commissioner evaluate how to ease restrictions safely and consider the availability of personal protective equipment. The University of Virginia Medical Center began delaying elective surgeries in mid-March. In a recent Board of Visitors meeting, President Jim Ryan told board members that UVa\u2019s conservation of PPE and preparation of beds and contingency housing made the hospital feel confident about its ability to handle a crisis, according to minutes, but now \u201cthe medical center is largely empty and unable to provide the normal care which is detrimental financially.\u201d Northam also decided to keep the Department of Motor Vehicles offices closed to the public until May 11. And he directed the state police to continue suspending enforcement of motor vehicle inspections until July 31. Local law enforcement can still issue citations for expired inspections. Virginians are under a stay-at-home order until mid-June, and nonessential businesses are to remain closed until May 8.","86":"Dozens of southern Albemarle County residents gathered in their vehicles Friday evening to pick up boxes of food and other items from the B.F Yancey Community Food Pantry. The food pantry, which operates on the fourth Friday of every month, has seen more people since the COVID-19 pandemic started and created a cash crunch for many families. \u201cLast month, we had 108 individuals, and we\u2019re expecting a little bit more tonight,\u201d said Berlinda Mills, the pantry\u2019s coordinator. \u201cThey\u2019re excited because they get the quality. This is our passion.\u201d Mills delivers food to those who are homebound, and the pantry boasts 20 volunteers from all over the area. The pantry accepts donations and also receives items from the Blue Ridge Area Food Bank, but volunteer Jackie Harris noted that it\u2019s only a small portion of what area residents likely need in a month. \u201cIt equates to a few meals,\u201d she said. \u201cIt helps, but for the people who need it, it\u2019s a drop in the bucket.\u201d UVa fund helps 600-plus The University of Virginia\u2019s Emergency Assistance Fund has provided assistance to more than 600 furloughed contract workers and university employees, according to a news release this week. UVa President Jim Ryan this month announced that the university would set up a $2 million emergency assistance fund for contract employees and workers who have been furloughed. The majority of applications for assistance have come from UVa employees and then contract workers. The largest share of contract employees requesting assistance work for Aramark, the university\u2019s primary food service provider. Most receiving assistance were given between $1,000 and $1,200, according to the university. Jefferson Trust donation The Jefferson Trust has raised $125,000 to help UVa students, health care workers and patients amid the COVID-19 crisis. The funds, raised in 10 days and spurred by a challenge grant from the trust\u2019s chair, Ashley Manning, will go toward UVa\u2019s Student Life and Leadership Fund, created to support students affected by the virus and the university\u2019s closure, and the UVa Health COVID-19 Support Fund, which helps Health System workers and patients in need. \u201cDuring this unprecedented time, we understand that the needs of the university are greater than ever,\u201d Manning said in a news release. \u201cThere is a grave need at the hospital, and the students\u2019 needs continue to emerge.

N95 mask fit testing is conducted to confirm a tight seal forms between the respirator and the wearer\u2019s face before it is used in the workplace to ensure that users receive the expected level of protection by minimizing any contaminant leakage into the mask. The specialized masks are critical for health care workers who are treating patients with communicable diseases.

On Saturday, for instance, the department reported that 12,366 Virginians have tested positive for the virus out of 72,178 tests, that 436 people have died and that 1,942 have been hospitalized. These are cumulative numbers, and unless you keep a daily log, you can\u2019t know with a simple glance that these daily totals represent 772 more people knowing they have the illness, 26 more Virginians dying from the virus and 105 more admitted to hospitals than the day before. Nor does Virginia tell you how many people have been discharged from hospitals or how many are believed to have recovered. People are interested in the numbers. The health department\u2019s website has logged 30 million more hits this spring than it did last year, and the landing page for the coronavirus has had 20 million views since it went up in March. But what are these numbers actually telling people about the spread of the disease, the risk to individuals and the potential for overwhelming hospitals\u2019 ability to care for the very ill? How concerned should we be when on April 15, the daily report had 41 more people dying than the previous day, a marked spike over earlier days when single digits or numbers barely above 10 had been recorded? What does it mean when positive cases rise 700 or drop 300 in a day? Do the increases mean to hunker down, it\u2019s getting worse? Do declines signal we\u2019ve passed the peak and it\u2019s OK to relax? Dr. Lilian Peake, the state\u2019s epidemiologist, said the daily reports reflect data entered into the health department\u2019s system during the previous 24 hours. The numbers do not necessarily represent how the disease moves through a state or a community, and they include test results that were taken from sick people as soon as the day before or as far back as two weeks or more. They log deaths that might have happened weeks ago. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at it from different perspectives. Here you have a reporter looking to see what changed that day and looking for the story behind that. But really the purpose of epidemiology is to talk about the trends,\u201d she said during an April 17 phone interview. It\u2019s less important to know the total of cases or how many are reported daily, she said, than it is to know how many people actually become ill each day. All about the curve To view the key disease tracking tool, known as an epidemiological curve, you need to click on the department\u2019s weekly report and then on the \u201ccase timing\u201d tab. This is where the health department plots the dates of when people first began to feel ill. Local health department investigators determine this by interviewing each person and their doctors. If someone is on a ventilator or has died, case investigators make a best guess as to when symptoms first appeared. The first two Virginia cases were reported to the health department on March 7. \u201cAs we continued to get more cases and we went and interviewed them, the earliest known symptomatic cases occurred Feb. 28. We know of three cases, two in the Northern region and one in the Eastern region, that actually got sick on Feb. 28,\u201d Peake said. \u201cSo that\u2019s when we know it began to circulate in Virginia.\u201d Virginia\u2019s epidemiological curve looks like the left side of a rising arc. \u201cFor all disease outbreaks, you start with a susceptible population, the proportion of the people who can get sick. With a novel virus like this, it\u2019s all of us,\u201d she said. \u201cAt some point enough people are infected so it slows down the rate. There aren\u2019t as many people who can get it quickly. It gets to a peak and it starts to decline.\u201d Researchers are modeling how they think the virus will act by making assumptions gleaned from its spread elsewhere. The state model built by University of Virginia\u2019s Biocomplexity Institute looks at what has occurred in each locality, and how people usually travel and interact, and then it predicts how the virus will affect people if they keep to the same patterns or stay home. The model pushes Virginia\u2019s peak in infections out to the summer. Peake can look at the curve and see that social distancing practices put into place in mid-March slowed the pace at which the disease was spreading. Hospitals From a public health perspective, slowing the spread of the disease doesn\u2019t necessarily mean keeping any one particular person from falling ill. The goal is to keep many individuals from becoming seriously ill at the same time. \u201cIt is important to us to explain how fast this is affecting people and how many people are getting seriously ill. That can help us to understand the impact on our health systems,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have a good sense of what our hospitals can manage, and so we want to be looking at what is the potential impact of people that are expected to be hospitalized. That has been the key factor of this disease worldwide, is the number of people who can be hospitalized at one time is so great that it threatens our health care system.\u201d Virginia\u2019s hospitals have more than 6,000 beds and nearly 2,900 ventilators, according to the Virginia Hospital and Healthcare Association\u2019s COVID-19 dashboard. The association reports that the hospitals care for about 1,300 patients each day who have COVID-19, with about 400 of them in intensive care units and about 250 on ventilators. The hospitals on Thursday asked the governor to allow them to restart elective surgeries and other procedures that were put on hold to prepare for the pandemic. They said they have enough capacity to handle the virus patients and to begin to treat other patients. Gov. Ralph Northam instead extended the ban until May 1. Not all of the hospital patients are spread evenly across the state, and the UVa modelers have predicted that different regions will see peak patients at different times, starting in Northern Virginia and progressing to Southwest. Reopening Virginia Northam has said he will rely on science and data to guide his decisions on how and when to reopen commerce. He often talks about his phone conversations with Maryland\u2019s governor and the District of Columbia\u2019s mayor, and about how Virginia will need to coordinate with its neighbors. For example, if Virginia allowed people to dine in its restaurants before D.C. did, then the neighbors might come for dinner, and who knows what viruses might hitchhike across the Potomac with them. While data from Washington and from Maryland\u2019s nearby counties show similar trends in infection rates to Northern Virginia, the data tell different stories in other parts of Virginia. Fairfax, Fairfax County, Arlington, Alexandria and Prince William and Loudon counties on Wednesday accounted for nearly half the COVID-19 cases in the state, 45% of the hospitalizations and 37% of the deaths. In the Roanoke and New River valleys, the virus has killed four people, three of them Botetourt County residents, and has caused hospitalizations for 27 people out of the statewide total of 1,942. The cases are occurring at an even slower rate in counties west of the New River, with the exception of Washington and Smyth counties, where the Mount Rogers Health District has reported four outbreaks in long-term care and health facilities. Northam\u2019s executive orders so far have been applied statewide. He said Friday that Virginia is one commonwealth and that he would not use the data to consider easing restrictions in parts of the state that are less affected by the virus. Who is affected \u201cOne way we can use the data is to use the large numbers and look at who\u2019s being affected, and that gives us opportunities to come up with strategies and let those people know of ways to protect themselves,\u201d Peake said. \u201cWhat\u2019s more important than the exact number of people who are hospitalized is looking at the information about those people. We absolutely know the people who are older are getting sicker, if you will,\u201d she said. The data show that children 9 and under, who represent 12% of Virginia\u2019s population, account for fewer than 1% of the cases. And it\u2019s much the same for 10- to 19-year-olds, who make up 12.6% of the state\u2019s population and about 2% of the COVID-19 cases. No children have died in Virginia, and very few have been hospitalized. \u201cIf you compare that to the older population who are 80 and older: That\u2019s 3.5% of the population of Virginia, but it accounts for 42.6% of the deaths,\u201d Peake said. \u201cThat\u2019s what these data are really for. How to put the data together to see who is at risk and what actions can be put in place to protect them.\u201d That\u2019s why it is also important to collect data on race. \u201cYou can determine whether the population is disproportionately affected and have a different type of intervention,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you look at data and see African Americans are disproportionately being hospitalized and disproportionately dying, then you need to understand why. What is going into that?\u201d It could be there\u2019s a need for more testing to identify cases earlier and make sure they get the care they need, she said. Initially, race was not collected since it isn\u2019t filed with the electronic lab reports, but the information can be collected through health district investigations and hospital data and vital records. Dr. Norman Oliver, the state\u2019s health commissioner, said Monday that African Americans, who make up about 20% of Virginia\u2019s population according to the U.S. Census, represent 28% of the COVID-19 cases for which race is known, and 34% of the deaths. It is not known what percentage of all the people who have been tested are African American. What isn\u2019t known Virginia reports on how many people have been tested. Virginia Secretary of Health and Human Services Daniel Carey has acknowledged that the state is at the bottom at rankings in per capita testing, and that the goal is to do thousands more tests each day. He said the state has not been able to secure all of the supplies and equipment it needs amid shortages and competitions among the states. Peake said some states had a boost because a commercial lab was headquartered there, such as LabCorp in North Carolina. Also, Virginia did not have a federal testing site, so it missed out on those supplies. Everyone has called for more testing, but how much is enough? Tests have been reserved for top priorities: people in hospitals and those who care for them, emergency service workers who may have come in contact with an infected person, and those who live or work in nursing homes and other long-term care facilities. \u201cIt\u2019s helpful to understand how we know whether we are testing enough. The World Health Organization did talk about this recently, and they said countries that have extensive testing, typically fewer than 12% of their tests are positive,\u201d Peake said. \u201cSo in Virginia right now, it\u2019s about 15% of our tests are coming back positive. \u201cI do think the testing has been targeted at places with a lot of transmission. And if we were having a large percentage of our tests coming back positive, then there would be more concern,\u201d she said. \u201cThat being said, I want to see the tests increase.\u201d The health department has not analyzed testing by localities or health districts. \u201cWe want to understand if there are any differences in testing rates so we can focus testing there, and to correlate to cases and also to look at percent positive tests over time,\u201d she said. The department publishes the number of tests by district, and the number of positive cases. Calculations on Wednesday showed that in Roanoke, 1.5% of the 1,855 tests administered were positive. In the New River Health District, 5% of the 1,309 tests given were positive. In Richmond, 15.7% of the 1,647 tests given were positive. And in Fairfax, 23.6% of 9,759 tests were positive. The state recently added hospitalizations and deaths by locality to its online dashboard. But what it doesn\u2019t report is how many of the local cases are linked to outbreaks in nursing homes, jails, homeless shelters or other places where people live or gather in close proximity. It publishes information on outbreaks by category type and by health district, but with health districts often encompassing several localities it is not known exactly where they are occurring. The federal government last week directed long-term care facilities to tell families of positive cases for staff and residents and required them to report cases directly to the Centers for Disease Control. Oliver, Virginia\u2019s health commissioner, has said state code does not permit the department to release information on facilities. On Wednesday, he said the homes can share information on positive cases with each other. This is important because nurses, certified nursing assistants and other providers often work at more than one home. But the information still won\u2019t be public. The state posts information that includes the number of outbreaks, how many people are affected overall and how many have died. But that information lags media reports. The site on Saturday still showed Roanoke as one of the few health districts without an outbreak, even though one of the city\u2019s nursing homes had reported that a resident and three staff members were infected. The total of deaths arising from long-term care facilities also was pegged at 78 on Thursday, which is most likely an undercount given the high deaths reported from homes in Henrico County, Harrisonburg and Northern Virginia. It often takes time before deaths are entered into the system. Sometimes case investigators don\u2019t know the person has died, or they haven\u2019t had time to enter the data, or the case is not known until the death certificate is filed with vital records.","89":"Though the Charlottesville-Albemarle region benefits from the UVa community, I shudder to think what our situation might be if the students had returned from around the country and the globe.

The disease that has spread rapidly across the world \u2014 killing hundreds in the state and more than 200,00 worldwide \u2014 has no known treatment, so COVID-19 has presented a unique challenge to the doctors faced with saving lives against a mostly-unknown enemy. But, in an effort to discover treatments, medical researchers in the state have dropped everything to ramp up experimental clinical trials that many be the patients\u2019 best hope of recovery. When Dr. Antonio Abbate, speaks with patients about the possibility of joining a clinical trial, he\u2019s used to standing next to the patients, holding their hands and looking into their eyes. Joining a clinical trial means he or she is volunteering to receive an experimental treatment that has not been proven to be effective. Abbate, the medical director of the clinical research unit at VCU Medical Center, has to tell them about the possible benefits and risks. But in the new reality where physical proximity means greater danger for health care workers and patients alike, he\u2019s had to get accustomed to having those conversations by video chat. As of Friday, VCU had enrolled 38 people in trials to test two drugs, remdesivir and sarilumab. \u201cEverybody stopped what they were doing and really focused on [COVID-19],\u201d said Dr. F. Gerard Moeller, who chairs the committee at VCU that reviews new clinical trials. Studies on two experimental drugs were approved in days rather than the usual weeks or months it would usually take, he said. Currently, the trials are only for people whose COVID-19 is serious enough for them to be hospitalized and doctors determine which trial to enroll a patient based on the specifics of the case. \u201cWe\u2019re not jumping steps, we\u2019re just working nights and weekends to make things happen,\u201d Abbate said, emphasizing the importance of not disregarding safety. \u201cI am optimistic that we will have treatments within months. I\u2019m just not sure which one it will be.\u201d Remdesivir is an antiviral drug that has not been approved, but has been used experimentally to treat Ebola and tested in animals with other diseases caused by different kinds of coronaviruses. The company that manufactures the drug, Gilead Sciences Inc., announced hopeful results on April 10 that the drug had shown improvement in 68% of a small group of 53 patients with severe complications of COVID-19 treated through a clinical trial. But the World Health Organization accidentally published findings from a trial that took place in China that found no benefit from the drug, but the findings were inconclusive because the study was ended early, Stat News reported Thursday. Remdesivir is also being tested at clinical trials at the University of Virginia Medical Center and HCA Henrico Doctors\u2019 Hospital. Sarilumab is approved for treating rheumatoid arthritis and is focused not on fighting the novel coronavirus directly, but on calming an overactive inflammatory response to the virus that damages the body. At the UVa Medical Center, doctors specializing in infectious disease and critical care began looking at evidence for different potential therapies for COVID-19 before treating their first patient. \u201cWe wanted to hit the ground running,\u201d said Dr. Patrick Jackson, an infectious disease specialist leading the remdesivir trial at UVa. Jackson said that many of his patients have been enthusiastic about participating in the clinical trial because they want to be part of the effort to find a treatment for COVID-19 that will help more people down the road. He\u2019s hoping to have some initial results from the trial, which is being run at hospitals across the country lead by the National Institutes of Health. On Monday, his team will begin the second phase of the trial that will include adding a different drug, baricitinib, which is an anti-inflammatory used to treat rheumatoid arthritis. They also plan to start enrolling patients in additional studies soon, including another effort to reduce the body\u2019s inflammatory response by using adult stem cells. Another experimental treatment that is taking hold across the world is the use of convalescent plasma, which is taken from the blood of people who have recovered from COVID-19. The plasma contains antibodies that can help the immune system fight of the virus. \u201cThere\u2019s been a history of using the plasma of patients who have successfully recovered from a disease,\u201d said Dr. Dennis Szurkus, chief medical officer at HCA Henrico Doctors\u2019 Hospital, which is participating in a study run by the Mayo Clinic. \u201cWe\u2019re hoping it will be highly effective.\u201d VCU Medical Center, Bon Secours hospitals and the UVa Medical Center also are using the plasma treatment. But in order for the hospitals to administer this treatment, they need blood donations from people who have recovered from COVID-19 and meet the criteria, which currently include having a positive test for the disease and being symptom free for at least 28 days, or symptom free for at least 14 days and have a negative COVID-19 test. But as testing shortages have plagued the country, only 10% of the thousands of people who have reached out to the Red Cross hoping to donate over the last month met the eligibility criteria, according to a Friday news release from the American Red Cross. To help streamline the process, last week, the Food and Drug Administration approved an antibody test that the Red Cross will roll out to screen donated plasma for COVID-19 antibodies. The Red Cross won\u2019t be doing antibody testing for the general public. Those wanting to donate can learn more at redcrossblood.org\/plasma4covid. But even as researchers talk about the promise of quickly moving toward potential treatments, they\u2019re careful to warn against disregarding scientific protocol. \u201cYou want to do the best thing you can for that patient,\u201d said Moeller from VCU\u2019s clinical trial committee, explaining a physician\u2019s temptation to try out multiple treatments on a patient. \u201cAt the same time, if you just throw everything at the patient without any evidence, you don\u2019t know if what you did helped the patient \u2026 whether medications can be helpful or harmful \u2026 without controlled studies, we don\u2019t know that.\u201d The FDA has issued a warning against using hydroxychloroquine, an antimalarial drug that President Donald Trump has promoted as a possible treatment for COVID-19, outside of hospital and clinical trial settings because of possible side effects that could impact the heart. \u201cThere\u2019s a pressure to get treatments out there \u2014 as there should be,\u201d said Jackson, from UVa. \u201cBut we also risk doing the wrong thing for patients \u2026 We take very seriously the principal of, first, do no harm. That\u2019s why clinical trials like this are so important.\u201d","91":"RICHMOND \u2014 A network of doctors, scientists, policy experts and concerned citizens have penned an open letter to Gov. Ralph Northam calling for more aggressive measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in Virginia. The letter comes after Northam on Friday announced a blueprint for easing health restrictions if cases trend downward for 14 consecutive days. The Virginia Department of Health reported the number of COVID-19 cases rose more than 1,000 on Sunday to 12,970 statewide. The group, which includes dozens of professors with ties to the University of Virginia and Virginia Commonwealth University, among others, said in the letter posted to Endcoronavirus.org that Northam\u2019s stay-at-home order has saved lives, but that more action is needed before reopening can be done safely. Yaneer Bar-Yam, president of the New England Complex Systems Institute and leader of the initiative, said the goal shouldn\u2019t be slowing the spread of COVID-19 but to eliminate it completely. \u201cThe steps that have been taken are at the margins of whether it will persist for weeks or months but not the kind of things that will just stop it in its tracks. If you do that right, then within weeks, it\u2019s done,\u201d Bar-Yam said. The request comes as governors in other states begin to relax restrictions on commerce, including for retailers in South Carolina and tattoo parlors, salons and barbershops in Georgia. Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt allowed certain personal care businesses, such as hair salons, spas, nail salons and pet groomers, to welcome customers back \u2014 by appointment only \u2014 last week. The decision to loosen restrictions has ignited debate and drawn swift rebuke from experts concerned that half-measures will lead to a surge in new cases. The letter to Northam lists seven steps the initiative would like to see put into action in Virginia. The steps include expanding mask usage, using CT scans for testing, and converting facilities such as college dorms into voluntary isolation stations. The plea, endorsed by a range of workers from medical doctors to day care employees, calls for \u201csafe-travel\u201d rules to prevent areas already clear of the virus from importing newly positive cases. The measure would involve a 14-day quarantine for out-of-state visitors and limit travel to essential services such as food and supply shipments. \u201cWhy are we holding up areas from going back to normal? We\u2019re doing it because they can\u2019t be sure they won\u2019t have more cases next week,\u201d Bar-Yam said. Bar-Yam said he and the others who signed the letter hope Northam will take time to hear out the science behind the recommendations and how they work together to end the spread quickly. More than 2,000 Virginians have been hospitalized due to the virus, and 448 had died as of 5 p.m. Saturday. Last week, the VDH started reporting probable COVID-19 cases and probable deaths from the virus. Probable cases are people who are symptomatic with a known exposure to COVID-19 but have not been confirmed with a positive test. State health officials have said there\u2019s a lag in the reporting of statewide numbers on the VDH website, which malfunctioned Sunday evening. Figures on the website might not include cases or deaths reported by localities or local health districts.","92":"The University of Virginia Medical Center is treating 24 COVID-19 patients, and the anticipated surge of cases has yet to materialize, said Dr. Craig Kent, the university\u2019s executive vice president for health affairs, on Monday during a Board of Visitors meeting. If the area sees a spike in the number of patients, Kent said the medical center has the ideal environment to care for them after opening its new tower this month. The 84 beds in use are in negative pressure rooms. Additionally, the tower allows staff to isolate COVID-19 patients in one part of the hospital. \u201cI think we can reassure our patients in the community that come for non-COVID care that our patients with COVID are housed in one part of our hospital and that the rest of the hospital is without COVID patients,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that reassurance is going to be quite comfortable.\u201d Kent and other UVa officials updated board members Monday for 30 minutes over Zoom, a video conferencing app, before going into a closed session to discuss health system operations and finances in greater detail. The meeting \u2014 the board\u2019s fourth since the university canceled in-person classes March 11 \u2014 also included updates on classes for the fall semester. \u201cFirst and foremost, this is an existential crisis and higher ed may never be the same,\u201d said Jim Murray, the board\u2019s rector. Since the board\u2019s last meeting, UVa President Jim Ryan announced a hiring freeze, pay cuts for executives and a pause in capital projects to mitigate the financial impact of the pandemic. \u201cWe have been working hard to implement all of those,\u201d Ryan said, adding that staff members are thinking about creative ways to increase efficiency and reduce costs. \u201cThat effort on the academic side is going well. More needs to be done in the health system that you\u2019ll hear about later.\u201d Gov. Ralph Northam banned all elective surgeries until at least May 1, and state officials are evaluating how to safely ease restrictions on non-essential medical procedures and the availability of personal protective equipment. UVa board members and medical center officials have been in talks with the state on those plans. \u201cThis is the conversation we\u2019re having with our state is that we have 300 open beds and about 2,000 people whose surgeries are delayed,\u201d Kent said. \u201cWe would love to be able to take care of some of those people and we\u2019re very different in Charlottesville than is the case in Northern Virginia, and we do think that some flexibility about different geographies having the ability to care for their patients differently is something that should be considered.\u201d UVa officials are continuing to plan for what classes will look like in the upcoming fall semester with a focus on three options \u2014 beginning the fall semester on time and on Grounds, starting later or holding classes online. \u201cWe\u2019ll obviously be holding classes but the question is how many students will be on Grounds and what does that look like,\u201d Provost Liz Magill said. The Fall 2020 committee is planning to bring the pros and cons of each scenario to senior leadership by early to mid-May, Magill said. \u201cAll of us want students to be on Grounds in the fall, but we also recognize that we can\u2019t pretend away the virus, and we have to figure out if we can do this in a safe way,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cSome of this is not entirely within our control. Some of this will depend on our ability to increase our capacity to both test and trace, which we are working on right now. But it remains, as has been the case with everything with this virus, a highly fluid situation.\u201d","93":"This story has been corrected to reflect the state banned elective surgeries and operations. Employees at the University of Virginia Medical Center will be furloughed and others will take a 20% pay cut as the UVa Health System seeks to shore up its finances following a drastic drop in surgeries and clinic visits. \u201cSince the middle of March hundreds of inpatient beds have been empty (our beds are usually full), surgeries have declined by 70%, and clinic visits have been reduced by 90%,\u201d Dr. K. Craig Kent, executive vice president for health affairs, wrote in a memo to staff Tuesday. \u201cThe result has been a fall in revenue for clinical care and related services that is producing a deficit of $85 million a month. This is a $3 million loss to the health system each day.\u201d The medical center, which is a subset of the health system, had a $1.7 billion operating budget in fiscal year 2020. Hospital spokesman Eric Swensen said the medical center was seeking to make up for the $85 million in losses through the steps outlined Tuesday. A ban on elective surgeries, the statewide stay-at-home order and other safety precautions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic have reduced patient volumes at the medical center and hospitals across the state. As of April 18, more than 46,000 health care workers have filed initial unemployment claims, according to Virginia Employment Commission data. The university\u2019s Board of Visitors discussed the health system\u2019s finances in closed session Monday, in the latest example of state university leadership wrestling with the impact of the coronavirus on academic and medical programs. Previously, in a discussion focused on the academic half of the university, which is financially separate from the medical center, UVa said it would avoid furloughs and layoffs for as long as possible. Staff treating COVID-19 patients will not see any adjustment to their compensation or their jobs. The medical center has not seen a large increase in COVID-19 patients as of this week. Kent said the medical center\u2019s financial reserves are diminishing quickly. \u201c... Within a few short months we will not be able to fulfill our mission of delivering expert medical care to those in need, educating and training the next generation of providers, and conducting critical research,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe must act now to secure our future.\u201d Kent announced a range of measures to curb expenses Tuesday, including a 40% pay cut for himself. Other leaders at the medical center, the UVa Physicians Group, the School of Medicine and the School of Nursing, as well as physicians, will take a 20% pay cut through the end of July. Kent makes $950,000 a year, according to a board resolution authorizing his hiring in December. Employer contributions to retirement funds will be suspended for all non-physician employees through July. Non-patient staff at the medical center and the University Physicians Group will be furloughed for up to three months and those affected will be notified beginning May 1, according to officials. The university has created an emergency assistance fund to help furloughed employees, which heretofore has mostly aided contract employees. \u201cI have been at UVa just over two and a half months and would never have imagined our leadership team needing to make decisions of this magnitude,\u201d Kent wrote in a letter to medical staff, which was shared with the Progress. \u201cWe will monitor our current situation and evaluate these changes on a daily basis.\u201d Swensen said an estimate of the number of employees affected was not available, and that decisions on work adjustments and furloughs will be made at the departmental level. Those who work with patients could have their hours cut, depending on need. In addition to reducing non-essential expenses, The medical center and physicians group also reduce their financial support to the School of Medicine, School of Nursing and the health sciences library, which will mean budget cuts. Decisions about those reductions will be made by the schools, according to the memo. In a webpage on the university\u2019s HR website, a number of questions are addressed, including why additional actions are necessary, if the university is receiving federal funding and if its endowment can be used to help. Furloughed employees will be able to use paid time off, and all their benefits will continue. Kent wrote the furloughs would be temporary for an initial period of three months. \u201cThis is difficult for all of us at UVA Health,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt is our hope that by engaging in these furloughs today we will be able to avoid the widespread permanent layoffs we have seen across the region and country.\u201d UVa says its multi-billion dollar endowment is overwhelmingly made up of gifts to the university for specific purposes, and its legally restricted from spending the gifts on anything other than their intended purpose. Hospitals across the state and country have either furloughed or laid off employees in the face of declining revenues. The Virginia Hospital and Healthcare Association estimates hospitals in the state will lose $600 million in the 30-day period between late March and late April, according to the Virginia Mercury. On March 25, Gov. Ralph Northam issued an order prohibiting all inpatient and outpatient surgical hospitals, physicians\u2019 offices and others from providing non-emergency procedures and surgeries that require personal protective equipment. On April 23, Northam extended the ban to May 1. In a mid-April letter, the president and CEO of VHHA asked that Northam not extend the ban, which was set to expire April 24. UVa supported the association\u2019s position, Swensen said. VHHA estimated that 60,000 people have had their non-urgent inpatient and outpatient medical procedures canceled over the past month and 15,000 procedures will be canceled every week going forward. \u201cWe are concerned that continuing to delay their care while we have available capacity to address and\/or stabilize their conditions will have long-term negative impacts on health across the commonwealth,\u201d Sean T. Connaughton said in the letter. A number of states have already announced they will lift or ease bans on non-elective surgeries including Ohio, Oregon and parts of New York. \u201cWe will monitor our current situation and evaluate these changes on a daily basis. We are hopeful that this situation will resolve soon as possible,\u201d Kent wrote. \u201cHowever, we are uncertain of the timing. COVID-19 is unpredictable \u2013 as we have all learned. The sooner we are able to safely resume clinical care of patients in need, have our researchers back in the laboratory and our students in the classrooms and clinics, the sooner we will return to some level of normalcy.\u201d","94":"The federal government is trying to help businesses, local governments are trying to help businesses \u2014 and now local businesses are trying to help businesses. Project Rebound is an arm of the Charlottesville Regional Chamber of Commerce, which represents the business community. Charlottesville, Albemarle County and University of Virginia economic development departments are partners in the effort. The aim is to help businesses survive the economic devastation caused by customers\u2019 need to shelter at home rather than shop, a result of the threat from the highly contagious coronavirus. Most especially, it is to help businesses recover after the stay-at-home order expires. In an earlier editorial, we suggested that one of the programs recently launched by Charlottesville government might be able to serve as a clearinghouse of ideas for businesses trying to navigate the rough waters of the current economic storm. It sounds as if Project Rebound might serve that purpose. Many local efforts have evolved to support businesses (and residents) during the pandemic, including collaborations among businesses as they combine forces to maximize their individual strengths. \u201cWe felt like we had an opportunity to bring all those ideas together, so that we\u2019re not duplicating efforts, hopefully, and that we\u2019re exploring ideas and best practices ...,\u201d Chamber President and CEO Elizabeth Cromwell said in a video press conference last week. \u201cWe want to document practical, on-the-ground insights as well as broader aspirational goals \u2026 for use by any organization,\u201d she said. Teams have been set up to explore the problems and solutions specific to several areas. They include small business; arts and the creative culture; tourism and hospitality; nonprofits and community organizations; biotechnology and manufacturing; information technology, defense and financial services; plus a team assigned to \u201cPreparing Vital Infrastructure.\u201d Businesses don\u2019t have to be Chamber members to join Project Rebound. In fact, you don\u2019t have to be a business owner to participate. Comments are welcome from employees, managers, civic leaders and specialists in economics, according to the program\u2019s website. You can get more information and submit a comment at https:\/\/www.cvillechamber.com\/rebound\/. (The site also contains COVID-19 information and links to other business-related relief programs.) Once ideas for economic recovery are gleaned and best practices identified, the project will share them with the community. The goal is to help businesses not only survive the current crisis but also to position themselves for rapid comeback once shelter-at-home orders are ended. Depending on results, the Chamber might extend the project through 2020, even after those orders expire. This strikes us as an excellent idea. The need for good ideas never expires. If the Chamber catalyzes a better way for businesses to share discoveries, expertise, inspiration and practical tips, we will have a stronger business environment and a stronger community overall. Ms. Cromwell said Project Rebound was inspired by UVa basketball Coach Tony Bennett\u2019s comment about the team\u2019s comeback from a spectacular NCAA championship loss in 2018 to a spectacular championship triumph in 2019: \u201cIf you learn to use it right \u2014 the adversity \u2014 it will buy you a ticket to a place you could not have gone any other way.\u201d Could adversity make us stronger, better, more resilient? One thing\u2019s for sure: We\u2019ll have a better chance if we work together toward that aspiration. Programs such as Project Rebound are a valuable opportunity to do so.","95":"Area hospitals are set to resume elective operations after May 1 after Gov. Ralph Northam announced Wednesday that he\u2019ll let the ban on non-emergency procedures expire. Hospitals across Virginia haven\u2019t seen a surge in patients from COVID-19 as they initially predicted in March. With patient loads remaining manageable, many facilities have asked for the ban to be lifted. \u201cPeople have followed our stay-at-home order, and we are flattening that curve that we often talk about,\u201d Northam said. \u201cOur hospital census levels have remained steady, so now it is time for our hospitals to resume non-emergency activities.\u201d Northam\u2019s decision comes a day after the University of Virginia Health System said it was furloughing employees and cutting pay of physicians and executives. The UVa Medical Center has hundreds of empty beds and has seen surgeries and clinical visits drop by 70% and 90%, respectively, leading to a deficit of $85 million a month, officials said earlier this week. Hospital spokesman Eric Swensen said Northam\u2019s decision was helpful and that the medical center will begin scheduling those procedures as soon as possible once the restrictions lift. However, it is too soon to tell how the change could affect the staffing adjustments announced Tuesday. The changes are an attempt to make up the existing deficit, according to officials. \u201cAs we noted yesterday in our announcement, we will continually evaluate our situation and adjust these actions as necessary, which includes adjusting staffing on a shift-by-shift basis to meet patient care needs based on patient volumes,\u201d Swensen said. Jennifer Downs, a spokeswoman with Sentara Martha Jefferson Hospital, said elective surgeries will restart May 4. \u201cWe have worked diligently to develop a process that will allow us to perform these procedures in a safe manner,\u201d Downs said in a statement. \u201cWe are scheduling patients based on the most urgent needs, and will continue to expand our capacity as appropriate.\u201d Downs said that although the virus remains in the community, the hospital wouldn\u2019t restart procedures if officials weren\u2019t confident in their ability to keep the community safe. \u201cContinued masking requirements, COVID screenings at our entrances and re-designed waiting rooms to ensure proper social distancing, as well as new schedules for procedures to allow for continued robust cleaning in-between patients, are all still in place,\u201d Downs said. \u201cAdditionally, we have also expanded our pre-op screening process and will also be performing a COVID test on all patients prior to surgery.\u201d In the Thomas Jefferson Health District, 59 people have been hospitalized and 264 people have tested positive. The district unveiled a new, more detailed dashboard of current cases Wednesday afternoon. Other area agencies are working to make sure essential services are still possible. On Wednesday, the American Red Cross wrapped up a two-day blood drive at John Paul Jones Arena in an effort to replenish its blood supply, which has dwindled during the coronavirus pandemic. Due to social distancing guidelines, the Red Cross limited participation to 65 appointment slots each day; dozens showed up to donate. In-patient and outpatient elective procedures can include knee replacements and some cancer treatments. \u201cThese are procedures that can wait awhile but certainly not forever,\u201d Northam said. Dr. Craig Kent, UVa\u2019s executive vice president for health affairs, said Monday that the medical center does have the ability to isolate COVID-19 patients from the rest of the hospital after opening its new six-story tower early. As of Monday, the medical center was treating 24 patients who had the virus. The Virginia Hospital & Healthcare Association, which had urged Northam to lift the ban, said in a statement Wednesday that it was \u201cdeeply appreciative of the decision.\u201d \u201cAs the governor indicated today, Virginians who need medical procedures, surgeries and preventive care should know that it is safe to seek treatment at hospitals, which have ample capacity to provide that medical care and also treat patients impacted by COVID-19,\u201d a spokesman for the association said.","96":"Diana Tinta, a fourth-year student at the University of Virginia, has felt the impact of the novel coronavirus pandemic disrupt nearly every facet of her life. After being forced to finish the semester online, she and other fourth-year students won\u2019t be able to walk the Lawn in May. However, Tinta\u2019s most pressing concern is an inability to pay rent and a dissatisfaction with the options her leasing company has offered. \u201cWhen the pandemic started, I lost my part-time jobs just like a lot of other people did,\u201d she said. \u201cMy mom is a domestic worker and lost one of her jobs and had her hours reduced at her other job. With my father now also furloughed, I knew very quickly I would not be able to make rent payments.\u201d As a resident at a largely student-occupied building, The Standard, Tinta is surrounded by others who also have been affected by the pandemic. Soon after losing her jobs, Tinta said she reached out to her leasing company, Landmark Properties, to see if she could terminate her lease, which ends in July. She was told she could not without incurring fees. After rereading her lease, Tinta said it became apparent to her just how difficult and expensive it would be to end the lease early or find someone to sublet her apartment. She would have to either pay out the rest of the contract, which would cost several thousand dollars, or pay $250 for each remaining month that someone sublet the property, neither of which are tenable options. Tinta said her similarly situated roommate has received near-daily calls from the leasing company about her overdue rent. As a first-generation Latinx student who paid for school largely through scholarships, Tinta said she is in a different situation than many other student tenants, whose families may still be able to pay or help with their rent. \u201cMy family is in a really tight spot where our money needs to be directed to food and other necessities, not my rent,\u201d she said. \u201cLeasing companies and landlords really don\u2019t seem to care much for the livelihood of their tenants.\u201d According to a leasing agent at the Standard, residents who have been financially affected by the COVID-19 pandemic can apply for a \u201cCOVID-19 Hardship program.\u201d The program requires a tenant to fill out an application and provide proof they have filed for unemployment. Then the tenant\u2019s May rent payment would be split \u2014 with 50% due by May 15 and the rest split between June and July. Late fees would only be waived if full payments are made by the end of the month. Lease termination is only allowed if a tenant pays a \u201cno-cause termination\u201d fee, according to the Standard\u2019s Housing Agreement. Tinta, who felt she had few options left, turned to the Legal Aid Justice Center, which directed her toward financial resources that helped her pay her April rent. However, going forward, she is still unsure how she\u2019ll pay rent. Evictions are currently frozen in Virginia as a result of a state-wide order limiting court hearings to emergency matters until May 17. However, according to Michaela Lieberman, a health justice fellow at the Legal Aid Justice Center, individuals may still face suits in the future. \u201cIn [Tinta\u2019s] case, her landlord may bring suit for damages later and that approximate $1,800 would be a financial drop in the bucket for them but for her is a major deal at this time,\u201d Lieberman said. \u201cEveryone is really struggling through a really difficult time, and we\u2019re hoping landlords and leasing companies respond with empathy and kindness.\u201d According to Lieberman, Legal Aid is trying to get out in front of potential disputes and arrange for fair and equitable payment plans, though the organization believes rent waivers \u2014 where tenants do not have to pay missed rent now or in the future \u2014 are the ideal solution. Some leasing companies in the Charlottesville area have already taken steps to provide some assistance to tenants, though no major area agencies appear to have waived rent. According to Joy Waring, a leasing agent for Woodard Properties, which owns a mixture of student, professional and income-restricted housing, the company is working with residents on a case-by-case basis. \u201cSometimes that means helping them navigate available payment assistance resources, sometimes that means trying to drive marketing efforts on their behalf, and sometimes that means working with them on a payment plan,\u201d Waring said. After the state order suspending non-emergency court actions is lifted, Waring said Woodard Properties will continue normal collection practices for accounts that were overdue before the pandemic or if a tenant has made no attempt to contact the company and make payment arrangements. \u201cWe also have high expenses such as mortgages, insurance, property taxes, utilities, ongoing maintenance, repairs, property upkeep, as well as employee payroll and health care,\u201d Waring said. \u201cWe are constantly evaluating how to manage our income and expenses in order to best serve our customers, employees, contractors, vendors and community members at large. It is a daily balancing act.\u201d Whitney Godfrey, of Godfrey Property Management, said she waived tenants\u2019 late fees for April and plans to do the same for May. \u201cPrior to the shutdown, I emailed all of my owners and told them to prepare for late payments and check with lenders about payment plans, as I expected it would be necessary to work with some tenants who have been laid off or having to stay home for half of March and all of April,\u201d she said. Mike Johnson, a managing agent for PMI Property Management Inc., which owns properties in Charlottesville and across the nation, said the company has similarly waived late fees and asked tenants to pay what they can. Johnson said he\u2019s been surprised to see that around 95% of rent due was collected in April and that vacant properties continue to be rented. However, as the pandemic situation evolves, he said he would not be surprised to see things change. Other leasing agencies and landlords in Charlottesville and Albemarle County did not respond to inquiries about current policies. Though some leasing agencies and landlords have taken steps to assist their tenants and customers, Tinta said she would like to see them go further. \u201cIndividuals have already lost so much: their regular lives, their peace of mind, and in some cases, their family members, and rent is only adding more financial stress,\u201d she said. \u201cLandlords and leasing agencies really need to step up and aid and help people out; this isn\u2019t a question of whether we want to pay rent \u2014 it\u2019s about whether we can.\u201d","97":"An antiviral drug tested against COVID-19 at the University of Virginia appears to help patients with advanced cases recover 31% faster than patients who received a placebo. The National Institutes of Health reports that the drug, remdesivir, led to an improved recovery time of an average of 11 days, compared to 15 days for those who received a placebo, according to preliminary data. On Friday, the Food and Drug Administration authorized the emergency use of the drug remdesivir in COVID-19 patients, according to multiple news outlets. The drug appeared to improve survival \u2014 11.6% of placebo recipients died, compared with only 8% of remdesivir recipients. Remdesivir was tested at UVa and 67 other hospitals around the world as part of the Adaptive COVID-19 Treatment Trial. When enrollment was completed April 19, a total of 1,063 patients had been enrolled in the randomized, controlled trial. Dr. Taison Bell, a UVa critical care and infectious disease specialist, and one of the principal investigators of the trial at the health system, said that his team wanted to participate in the trial because, out of the different agents that were being considered, they thought remdesivir had the most promise based on its mechanism of action, which is how it produces an effect in the body. \u201cWe were excited to see that it, in fact, does have a benefit,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a modest benefit, let\u2019s not overstate and call it a miracle drug, but it does shorten the median time of symptoms by four days. And it gets people better, so that\u2019s good news.\u201d Dr. Anthony Fauci, who is helping lead the country\u2019s response to the pandemic, said during a White House briefing that the preliminary results show a \u201cproof of concept\u201d that the drug can aid in recovery. Remdesivir, developed by Gilead Sciences Inc., is an investigational broad-spectrum antiviral treatment administered via daily infusion for 10 days. Hospitalized adult patients with COVID-19 and significant symptoms \u2013 including difficulty breathing, using supplemental oxygen or needing a ventilator \u2013 were eligible to participate in the remdesivir trial. Participants were assigned at random to receive either remdesivir or a placebo intravenously for as long as 10 days. Recovery was defined in the trial as being well enough to leave the hospital or return to normal activities. The NIH said it would release more details in a report, and the findings have yet to be peer-reviewed. Bell couldn\u2019t say how many of the participants were at UVa, but did say there were multiple. UVa officials said earlier in the week that 24 COVID-19 patients were being treated in the hospital. Eventually, he said, the team hopes to tell participants who received the drug and who received the placebo, a process called \u201cunblinding.\u201d If people who received placebos still qualify for the treatment, they could then be offered remdesivir. \u201cIt\u2019s an unusual step to take so quickly with a trial like this, but we\u2019re in a very unusual time,\u201d he said. Gilead said that it has rapidly scaled its supply chain to make more of the drug, and has a goal to produce more than 140,000 treatment courses by the end of May, more than half a million treatment courses by October and more than 1 million treatment courses by December. Bell said that UVa also is looking at other trials, including some involving transfusing the plasma of people who\u2019ve recovered from COVID-19 into someone who recently got the disease to see if antibodies can help accelerate the recovery process, and as well as others involving immune modulating agents. There is only so much researchers want to attempt at one time, though: If multiple trials are ongoing, Bell said, it is more likely that patients and treatment teams can be overwhelmed with many different trial options. \u201cBut I would say I\u2019d rather have the problem of too many things to look at rather than too few things to look at,\u201d he said. \u201cIt just means you have to be selective about which trials you want to bring on site, and which ones you think would be more beneficial for which patient population. We have a committee set up to review these to make sure that we\u2019re all pulling in the same direction with our research efforts related to COVID.\u201d","98":"UVa started using an in-house test March 18 and has since been able to run 500 tests a day using a mix of its own machinery and commercial testing platforms and by creating its own supplies. This month, the university is set to acquire two more machines that will boost capacity to 2,000 a day. The university is looking to run 3,000 tests a day by early June. \u201cIt\u2019s not soon enough,\u201d said Dr. Amy Mathers, an infectious disease physician and associate director of clinical microbiology. Mathers said a shortage of testing platforms, kits and other supplies have hampered efforts to increase the availability of tests. \u201cThe commercial testing companies are not manufacturing enough kits or platforms,\u201d she said. \u201cEven if we wanted to design our own platform and kit, we would still have to get all the plasticware, all the chemicals, we would have to have an instrument on which to run it. The United States generally has gotten out of a lot of manufacturing. I think we are seeing the effects of that right now.\u201d Ramping up testing is a crucial step in the state\u2019s plans to reopen; Gov. Ralph Northam has said he wants to test 10,000 people a day before easing restrictions. Since the pandemic took hold in March, Virginia\u2019s testing rate has lagged behind almost every other state, according to an analysis by the Virginian Pilot. The state has averaged about 4,000 tests a day, according to the Pilot. As of Friday, about 105,000 tests have been conducted for COVID-19, with about 10% of results for people who had been tested multiple times, according to the Virginia Mercury. Mathers works daily to coordinate and keep track of the testing to ensure that the university doesn\u2019t overpromise capacity. \u201cIt\u2019s like air traffic control every day,\u201d said Mathers, who helped to develop the university\u2019s test. Right now, UVa could double its capacity right now if it had enough testing kits. In order to run a test on a machine, doctors need a set of chemical reagents that come in kits supplied by the company that manufactured the platform. \u201cThe companies have to give you, not just the platform or the machine, but they have to give you all the chemical components so that you can run the test,\u201d Mathers said. UVa has a Cepheid Infinity that could theoretically run 1,000 tests a day, but Mathers said they\u2019ve only been allocated 150-200 kits a day. Still, those numbers are helpful for a state still working to coordinate a patchwork of public and private labs; according to the Virginia Mercury, the state lab in Richmond can only run 450 tests a day, a rate lower than other states, and most tests have been done at large commercial labs. To combat supply chain issues, Mathers and others at UVa also are working to make necessary materials themselves, such as 6-inch-long nasopharyngeal swabs used to collect samples from individuals and viral transport media, a fluid that helps keep the virus alive so it can be tested. The swabs have been particularly hard to find because only three companies are making them, Mathers said. Mathers is working with UVa engineers to make swabs, and she\u2019s recently started a trial with the Food and Drug Administration to show that their version works as well as those currently on the market. \u201cIt\u2019s a really necessary thing,\u201d Mathers said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have tests, and we can\u2019t run the tests because we don\u2019t have swabs.\u201d Once registered with the FDA, Mathers said researchers will distribute swabs to people across the state. Right now, UVa has been testing its own patients, as well as those in congregated settings such as nursing homes or correctional facilities, in addition to running tests for other hospitals, Mathers said, though the Virginia Department of Health has moved to expand the criteria of who can be tested. \u201cThere\u2019s 8.5 million people in the state and we cannot test all of them on any given day,\u201d Mathers said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to continue to make sure that we test smartly and unfortunately, that means we can\u2019t test everyone all the time.\u201d The lack of widespread testing has limited public health officials\u2019 ability to figure out where the virus is spreading in a community and contain it. \u201cAs we expand testing, one of the things that\u2019s really important is that we make sure we\u2019re testing the right people,\u201d Mather said. \u201cBecause to control transmission, we have to test the people in the places where transmission is ongoing, so that we can stop it.\u201d Even if diagnostic testing ramps up, experts say that developing antibody testing, which can detect if someone has been infected and recovered from COVID-19 \u2014 even if they never displayed symptoms \u2014 is a crucial next step to getting people safely back to work and school. However, antibody tests can vary widely, and not all currently available are reliable, according to recent research. UVa is evaluating an antibody test currently in development, Mathers said, but hasn\u2019t started it using it widely. Rather, researchers are testing individuals known to have been infected to see how the antibody test performs. \u201cWe want to make sure how it works in a [specific] population before we open it up for everybody to start running it,\u201d she said.","99":"That is the burden under which the University of Virginia Medical Center has been suffering during the coronavirus lockdown \u2014 and that now has pushed the center into massive furloughs and pay cuts for some personnel. It starkly illustrates the tension between staying the course on the shelter-in-place orders keeping most of us at home vs. calls from some critics to re-open the economy in order to prevent a potentially global fiscal collapse. Non-patient staff at the UVa Medical Center will be furloughed for up to three months; some physicians and upper-level staff will take a 20% pay cut; and Dr. K. Craig Kent, executive vice president for health affairs, will take a 40% cut. Employer contributions to retirement accounts will be suspended for all non-physician employees through July. Staff treating COVID-19 patients will not see any change in their compensation or their jobs. The Medical Center\u2019s financial losses are triggered by a statewide ban on elective surgeries and by stay-at-home orders that have kept patients from visiting clinics for non-critical care. The decline has lost the center millions of dollars per day. That\u2019s unsustainable. Gov. Ralph Northam recently announced that elective surgeries can resume. Given the economic harm facing UVa\u2019s Medical Center and other hospitals in the state, any pressure to allow elective surgeries to start generating some income is understandable. Mr. Northam also floated a possible plan for nudging local economies forward again, perhaps region-by-region for those areas of Virginia where COVID cases are rare and, presumably, the coronavirus is a low threat. That suggestion generated strong pushback, including from several UVa professors. Their reaction came just before the UVa Medical Center made its announcement of cutbacks. We wonder if this harsh new development has changed any minds. To be clear: This newspaper also has encouraged Virginians to stay the course by staying home, minimizing the number of infections, lowering the death rate, and preventing first responders and hospital staff from becoming overwhelmed. This goal of flattening the curve also has provided some breathing space so that governments and private enterprises, such as manufacturers of disinfectants and personal protective equipment, for instance, could ramp up efforts to tame the virus. Those efforts have not gone as quickly as one would have wished. As Virginians have waited, we\u2019ve also begun to see more and more evidence of how flattening the curve of infections also is flattening the economy. What\u2019s good for one is terrible for the other. The apparent choice between health and the economy has never been absolute. It\u2019s always been a question of where to find the right balance between the two. Unfortunately, we can\u2019t all seem to agree on the proper point along the continuum between an economy that\u2019s wide open vs. a populace that is locked down, with no one allowed to emerge for any reason. Hospitals provide an instructive proxy for this debate. As centers for the battle against the coronavirus, both in treatment and in research, hospitals are directly and often damagingly affected. The relentless pressure to save patients from a disease we still don\u2019t understand well is debilitating for staff. The inability to save many of those patients takes an emotional toll. And the physical demands of the job wear down doctors, nurses, technicians and other staff, making them more susceptible not only to breakdowns from exhaustion but also to the virus itself. No wonder the cry is to flatten the curve, to prevent infection spikes that would further stress staff and instead to extend the period during which the virus is active. But that means we\u2019re also extending the time during which hospitals (and other businesses) are prohibited from doing business as usual. Resulting loss of income hits hospitals right alongside neighboring businesses. But if hospitals collapse from being starved of funds \u2014 a very real possibility, especially for those already operating on thin margins \u2014 who will care for patients, corona or otherwise, now or in the future? Hospitals have a lot to lose if the curve isn\u2019t flattened \u2014 but also a lot to lose if it is. By prohibiting business as usual, we are gambling with outcomes. We\u2019re assuming most businesses will be able to bounce back. We\u2019re assuming hospitals can stay open. If we\u2019re wrong about those assumptions, the results could be catastrophic.","100":"A new clinical trial at the University of Virginia Medical Center is testing the plasma of people who have recovered from COVID-19 to see if it could be a potential treatment for inpatients with the disease, the university announced Monday. Plasma from recovered patients, also known as convalescent plasma, has antibodies that potentially could aid in treatment and will be provided by the American Red Cross. The trial is the university\u2019s second that has looked into virus treatments. Inpatients who have tested positive for the virus will have the opportunity to participate in the trial. UVa physicians will call patients who tested positive and are recovering from COVID-19 to ask if they would be screened by the Red Cross as a potential plasma donor. Other community members who have tested positive also are encouraged to contact the Red Cross to see if they are eligible to donate plasma. More information can be found at redcrossblood.org. \u201cConvalescent plasma has been used with success in other serious coronavirus infections such as SARS and MERS, and even in the recent Ebola virus outbreak,\u201d said Dr. Scott Heysell, an infectious disease specialist at UVa and one of the lead investigators for the trial. \u201cThis option may boost the body\u2019s own ability to coordinate an effective immune response to clearing the virus and preventing severe COVID-19 disease.\u201d \u201cI am pleased that we are exploring another avenue in a search for an effective treatment against COVID-19,\u201d said Dr. Craig Kent, the university\u2019s executive vice president for health affairs. \u201cClinical trials like this are a valuable part of the work accomplished at academic health systems.\u201d","101":"Two surprise performers will help the University of Virginia celebrate the Class of 2020 virtually as it officially confers degrees to about 7,250 graduates on May 16. The university is still planning to hold a graduation ceremony in-person in October of this year or May of 2021, depending on the guidelines and restrictions in place at the time. Final Exercises were postponed in March shortly after the university canceled classes on grounds because of COVID-19. \u201cThis is an extraordinary and unusual time, and we are thrilled to have an opportunity to celebrate the many accomplishments of our students \u2013 and to mix in some surprises,\u201d President Jim Ryan said in a news release. The ceremony will begin at 1 p.m. with the first surprise performer, followed by UVa\u2019s traditional Year-in-Review video that will include highlights from the school year. A student-led performance will follow the conferral of degrees. The second surprise entertainer and a student performance of \u201cThe Good Old Song\u201d will wrap up the ceremony, expected to last 30 minutes. A committee of students, faculty and staff planned the virtual event. Ryan will deliver remarks to the Class of 2020 as requested by students and the committee, according to the release. The virtual ceremony will be streamed at virginia.edu\/live and on social media. \u201c... I hope this will be a memorable celebration, but we recognize it\u2019s not the same as walking the Lawn for our graduating students and their families,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cWe are looking forward to gathering again in either October or the spring of 2021 to see the Class of 2020 process down the Lawn for what I think will be one of the most joyful moments in the history of UVa.\u201d CHS Charlottesville City Schools is planning a virtual graduation and other activities to recognize the Class of 2020 at Charlottesville High School. Students will have the chance later this month to walk across a graduation stage and take a photo in their cap and gown with a blank diploma cover. Actual diplomas will be mailed later this summer. The high school is planning a \u201cvictory lap\u201d experience for students and their families on May 14 and May 15. Students can drive around the school\u2019s parking lot and take photos at designated stations. One station will be the graduation stage. There, seniors will cross the stage as their name is announced while family members stay in the car. Students can sign up for time slots from 1 p.m. to 7 p.m. on both days. \u201cWe have a real heart for this year\u2019s senior class,\u201d schools Superintendent Rosa Atkins said in a news release. \u201cAll of our students have experienced loss, but senior year is truly a special time. So we are finding new ways to show love and honor to our young people.\u201d A video featuring photos from the graduation stage and speeches will be released at 7 p.m. on June 4, when the graduation ceremony was originally scheduled, on social media and on local cable channel 14. CHS also is highlighting its senior class through social media posts and preparing yard signs for families to display in honor of their graduates. \u201cI am so proud of these students,\u201d CHS Principal Eric Irizarry said in the release. \u201cTheir spirit and resilience have been proven over and over again. We invite the community to help see and honor the Class of 2020.\u201d More information is available at charlottesvilleschools.org\/grad2020.","102":"\u201cIt\u2019s a remarkable thing, mid-pandemic \u2014 arguably when we need them most, to have an emergency service provider \u2026 send a letter just saying, \u2018We\u2019re done,\u2019\u201d said County Administrator Mark Taylor. \u201cI suspect there are things going on behind the scenes over there that we don\u2019t even understand yet as to why they make decisions like this,\u201d added Board of Supervisors Chairman Bill Martin. Within days came the news that the UVa Medical Center was making drastic cuts, reducing some salaries by 20% and instituting furloughs of up to three months, in addition to other moves. The center, a component of the health system, was losing $3 million daily after clinics and surgeries shut down due to state orders aimed at curtailing the spread of COVID-19. Do we have any inside knowledge that these losses contributed to ending the contract? No, but the timing is conspicuous. Last month, Medic V, \u201ca branch of the Medical Transport Network at UVa Medical Center,\u201d according to its Facebook page, notified Greene that it would end its contract for providing emergency response services. Dropping the contract required a 180-day notice. In one capacity or another, Medic V has been providing paid personnel since 2011, the Greene County Record reports. Originally, Medic V simply filled in when volunteers were unavailable. But like so many other local emergency rescue services (fire departments, too), Greene began having difficulty recruiting sufficient volunteers. As a result, Medic V was contracted to provide two daytime shifts and two nighttime shifts for the county seven days a week. Recently, Greene has spent around $1 million a year for Medic V services, in addition to paying for vehicles and materials, the Record reports. Meanwhile, it turns out that the county already had put out a request for proposals to see if any other emergency services organizations might be interested in a contract. The RFP, sent out last winter, generated little response. So in the face of this emergency \u2014 insufficient volunteerism, increased potential need due to COVID-19, unexpected upcoming loss of Medic V services, and previous difficulty finding a different contractor \u2014 what\u2019s the county to do? It would seem that Greene is in a tough spot. But maybe not as tough as it looks. \u201cWhile I was initially shocked by the information, I have already come to embrace this as positive news for Greene County,\u201d said Melissa Meador, emergency services manager for Greene. \u201cHaving our own EMS department will allow Greene County to take a more proactive approach to EMS management, operations and services.\u201d In other words, with full local control, a county-funded emergency services operation could better serve county needs. And with Greene already paying around $1.1 million to Medic V, it will have that much revenue to apply to its own paid rescue service. In addition, the county already owns some infrastructure \u2014 such as those aforementioned vehicles. And finally, Greene also still has volunteer rescue squad and fire departments, with which the county has service agreements and whose help could be utilized. Ms. Meador told a recent meeting of the Board of Supervisors that, from her initial estimate, the county would have to make up a difference of around $466,000. That\u2019s not insignificant, but it\u2019s not insurmountable. \u201cI think we\u2019re at a good position for us to make this move,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s so many advantages\u2026. \u201cI wish I had an easy answer to where this remaining funding would come from. But I just wanted to make sure everyone understood that we\u2019re not at zero.\u201d We like her attitude. She\u2019s taking a problem and repurposing it as an opportunity for improvement. We wish the county great success in its quest to form its own paid emergency services operation. If it can be done efficiently and expeditiously, we agree that the residents of Greene would see noticeable benefits to a \u201chome-grown\u201d department.","103":"For the University of Virginia Cavalier Marching Band, spring usually means a chance to get dolled up and celebrate the year\u2019s achievements at \u201cband prom\u201d \u2014 the group\u2019s annual awards banquet. This year, though, the global coronavirus pandemic threatened to bring the celebration to an abrupt halt. But as more end of the school year celebrations turned to virtual gatherings, the band took the cue and moved the beloved celebration to the Internet. More than 200 band members, supporters and staff gathered on Zoom Wednesday evening to honor each other and commemorate the year. \u201cTonight is all about you, and it\u2019s about celebrating everything that\u2019s great, that\u2019s best about the Cavalier Marching Band,\u201d said Andrew Koch, UVa\u2019s interim director of bands. Ahead of the festivities, Koch said the banquet is a huge occasion for the band. \u201cIt\u2019s casually called the band prom,\u201d he said before the 16th band banquet kicked off over the meeting app. \u201c People get dressed to the nines and come out and we celebrate the year we take time to honor every band member, each comes across the stage.\u201d Three drum majors thought up the banquet, including the awards, Koch said, and it\u2019s now become an event students look forward to every year. As it became clear that an in-person gathering wasn\u2019t realistic this year, one of the members of the band\u2019s banquet crew asked Koch if he had considered doing it virtually. \u201cTo be frank, I hadn\u2019t, and then that kind of planted a seed that just grew and grew and grew,\u201d he said. This year the band wove philanthropy into the event, as every student was asked to donate whatever they were able to the Community Emergency Response Fund, housed at the Charlottesville Area Community Foundation. Koch and his wife, Kristin, will round up the overall donation and a local band supporter has offered to match their donation. The evening was full of guest speakers, and each member\u2019s name was read. The \u201cband Heisman,\u201d which is the top award voted on by the students and the staff, was presented to Jessica Moskowitz. John McHale, a third year tuba player, said that in the grand scope of things, having a culminating event changed pales in comparison to much of what\u2019s going on in the world, but it\u2019s still a little disappointing to not be able to end the year in person. \u201cI think it\u2019ll be super cool, even though it\u2019s not the same as being in person, it\u2019s nice to have something marking the end, for many people, of four years of a significant college experience,\u201d he said. Getting to go to the ACC Championship and the Orange Bowl were highlights of McHale\u2019s year in band, he said. \u201cGoing to UVa I didn\u2019t necessarily think that I would end up in one of the big six bowls in college football, but it was definitely a welcome surprise,\u201d he said. Tatayana Allen, a fourth year co-captain of the color guard, said one of her most memorable moments this year was when Virginia beat Virginia Tech. \u201cI love when the football team wins, but it wasn\u2019t just about beating Virginia Tech, that\u2019s not really my thing, it was getting the last chance to perform in Scott Stadium, and it just being a fun game,\u201d she said. \u201cSo many people were there, and so many people stayed throughout the game and cheered for the team, and watching people rush the field is really, really fun.\u201d Even though the banquet can\u2019t be held in person, Allen said, the band is lucky to be able to do it at all. \u201cIt\u2019s like marching band \u2014 everything is always changing and we always have to make quick changes,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is kind of nothing new to us, and we always expect things to change and we always adapt really well.\u201d","104":"The town hall, set for 3 to 4 p.m., aims to provide answers to commonly asked questions regarding local COVID-19 cases and investigations and re-opening businesses and to provide an open forum for other community questions.

Having that sense of normalcy at home has been super helpful to be able to look forward to and come back to.\u201d Having Michael at home, as he\u2019s been telecommuting, has been a blessing, Lovdal said, but because she and her husband work full-time, homeschooling Elias has been a challenge. \u201cI\u2019m tired,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s very challenging to be working full-time and not just as a nurse, but anybody working full-time and having kids, because there is this expectation to homeschool. We don\u2019t always have the capacity to do that. I\u2019ve been doing my best.\u201d The Fluvanna County school division has sent packets home, and Elias is eager to get them done, Lovdal said. Outside of that school work, they\u2019ve worked to turn everyday activities, such as reading an analog clock, into teaching lessons. \u201cHe\u2019s been helping me cook and you can turn that into a math lesson with the measuring cups and things like that,\u201d she said. Elias has been handling the transition to school at home well, playing a slew of games with his dad. \u201cThey play Harry Potter, Legos and superheroes \u2014 all kinds of things,\u201d Lovdal said. \u201c[Michael] keeps him really engaged with that, which is great.\u201d In early March, they discussed whether Lovdal, who has worked for UVa for 10 years, should live somewhere else while stationed on the COVID unit but instead devised a plan to quarantine her at home if necessary. \u201cWe really don\u2019t know when this is going to end, and if there\u2019s going to be another surge,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s really practical to not live with my family.\u201d Plus, she has confidence in the personal protective equipment at the hospital. In her unit, every three patients have a coach who supervises the process of donning and doffing the equipment, which includes a gown, gloves, goggles and mask. \u201cI feel really safe with that process,\u201d Lovdal said. \u201cI don\u2019t feel any more at risk at work than I do going to the grocery store.\u201d At home, she leaves her shoes outside, washes her scrubs immediately and takes a shower before exchanging any hugs with her family. \u201cThey know \u2014 don\u2019t touch Mommy,\u201d she said. When Lovdal\u2019s not working, she\u2019s intentional with how she spends her time off and tries to stay off social media. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the biggest struggles I think for health care workers,\u201d she said. \u201cWe live it all day when we are at work and then when we leave, we want to just chill out and look at my Instagram feed or look at Facebook. [But] it\u2019s full of everyone\u2019s opinions about what\u2019s going on in the world. You feel like you can\u2019t escape it.\u201d Lovdal said she\u2019s inspired by her coworkers at the Medical Center who are facing fears related to the virus and showing up to work anyway. \u201cEven the bravest among us, even the most experienced among us, we\u2019re still scared of this,\u201d she said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t discriminate. It will knock anybody down. That\u2019s scary, and these people have been showing up day after day after day. It\u2019s been phenomenal.\u201d As the community has recognized the sacrifices of health care workers and stepped up to provide meals and treats, Lovdal said she feels spoiled. \u201cWe eat very well every day, so I\u2019m sure Mother\u2019s Day will be no different.\u201d","106":"Blood tests that check for exposure to the coronavirus are starting to come online, and preliminary findings suggest that many people have been infected without knowing it. Even people who do eventually experience the common symptoms of COVID-19 don\u2019t start coughing and spiking fevers the moment they\u2019re infected. \u00bb How common is it for people to contract and fight off viruses without knowing it? In general, having an infection without any symptoms is common. Perhaps the most infamous example was Typhoid Mary, who spread typhoid fever to other people without having any symptoms herself in the early 1900s. My colleagues and I have found that many infections are fought off by the body without the person even knowing it. For example, when we carefully followed children for infection by the parasite Cryptosporidia, one of the major causes of diarrhea, almost half of those with infections showed no symptoms at all. In the case of the flu, estimates are that anywhere from 5% to 25% of infections occur with no symptoms. For the most part, symptoms are actually a side effect of fighting off an infection. It takes a little time for the immune system to rally that defense, so some cases are more aptly considered presymptomatic rather than asymptomatic. \u00bb How can someone spread coronavirus if they aren\u2019t coughing and sneezing? Everyone is on guard against the droplets that spray out from a coronavirus patient\u2019s cough or sneeze. They\u2019re a big reason public health officials have suggested everyone should wear masks. But the virus also spreads through normal exhalations that can carry tiny droplets containing the virus. A regular breath may spread the virus several feet or more. Spread could also come from fomites \u2014 surfaces, such as a doorknob or a grocery cart handle \u2014 that are contaminated with the coronavirus by an infected person\u2019s touch. \u00bb What\u2019s known about how contagious an asymptomatic person might be? No matter what, if you\u2019ve been exposed to someone with COVID-19, you should self-quarantine for the entire 14-day incubation period. Even if you feel fine, you\u2019re still at risk of spreading the coronavirus to others. Most recently it has been shown that high levels of the virus are present in respiratory secretions during the presymptomatic period, which can last days to more than a week prior to the fever and cough characteristic of COVID-19. This ability of the virus to be transmitted by people without symptoms is a major reason for the pandemic. \u00bb After an asymptomatic infection, would someone still have antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in their blood? Most people are developing antibodies after recovery from COVID-19, likely even those without symptoms. It is a reasonable assumption, from what scientists know about other coronaviruses, that those antibodies will offer some measure of protection from reinfection. But nothing is known for sure yet. Recent serosurveys in New York City that check people\u2019s blood for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 indicate that as many as one in five residents may have been previously infected with COVID-19. Their immune systems had fought off the coronavirus, whether they\u2019d known they were infected or not \u2014 and many apparently didn\u2019t. \u00bb How widespread is asymptomatic COVID-19 infection? No one knows for sure, and for the moment lots of the evidence is anecdotal. For a small example, consider the nursing home in Washington where many residents became infected. Twenty-three tested positive. Ten of them were already sick. Ten more eventually developed symptoms. But three people who tested positive never came down with the illness. When doctors tested 397 people staying at a homeless shelter in Boston, 36% came up positive for COVID-19 \u2014 and none of them had complained of any symptoms. In the case of Japanese citizens evacuated from Wuhan, China and tested for COVID-19, fully 30% of those infected were aymptomatic. An Italian pre-print study that has not yet been peer-reviewed found that 43% of people who tested positive for COVID-19 showed no symptoms. Of concern: The researchers found no difference in how potentially contagious those with and without symptoms were, based on how much of the virus the test found in individuals\u2019 samples. The antibody serosurveys getting underway in different parts of the country add further evidence that a good number \u2014 possibly anywhere from around 10% to 40% \u2014 of those infected might not experience symptoms. Asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection appears to be common \u2014 and will continue to complicate efforts to get the pandemic under control.","107":"STANARDSVILLE \u2014 A large segment of the budget conversation during the April 28 Greene County Board of Supervisors\u2019 meeting was about a path forward for the rescue squad after the University of Virginia Health System notified the county of its desire to sever the contract to provide emergency medical service for the county earlier that month. The contract is scheduled to end on Oct. 14. This decision came in the middle of the COVID-19 global pandemic. \u201cThe existing contract cost is about $1.1 million annually, or about $92,000 a month,\u201d said Mark Taylor, Greene's county administrator. \u201cThe future of Greene County Volunteer Rescue is uncertain. Per the state code the county may establish an EMS agency or may contract with any EMS agency to provide EMS service. We issued an RFP (request for proposals) earlier this year and got no responses. We could hypothetically reissue an RFP for contract service. We could form a regional organization or partner with a neighbor to provide EMS or we could do nothing. The provision of emergency medical services to the community is not mandated in the state code.\u201d Taylor said he does not recommend the county suspend or discontinue providing EMS to the residents. \u201cWe simply wanted to provide the whole spectrum of possibility and there\u2019s certainly been no suggestion from any supervisor, or anyone, that the county should not provide it,\u201d Taylor said May 4. \u201cIn today\u2019s modern world there are certain norms and expectations. It was not a suggestion; it was merely an observation of the state of the law.\u201d Taylor said often people expect that if there\u2019s a mandate there are federal or state dollars to help localities pay for those services \u2014 and that\u2019s often not the case. \u201cIt\u2019s still very much on the localities to pay those costs,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cEMS is something that we may do, but it\u2019s obvious from the comments over the last year, I would say, it\u2019s significant to our residents and it\u2019s an expectancy that folks move to communities, even little Greene County, in modern times with expectancy that this service will be available and respond when they call.\u201d Greene County Emergency Services Manager Melissa Meador told supervisors on April 28 that the county is not building this agency from scratch. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of infrastructure in place. There\u2019s been a contingency plan in place for this for quite some time,\u201d Meador said. \u201cThe numbers that I ran basically put us at about $1.57 million, and that includes the same level of service that we have now with the UVa contracts. So, that does leave us short of $466,000 that we would have to \u2014 for lack of a better term \u2014 find somewhere to make this department happen.\u201d Meador noted the agency already has an EMS license agreement that would stay in place, as well as an agreement between the Greene County EMS (paid staff) and the Greene County Rescue Squad (volunteers) as far as equipment, the building and supplies. \u201cI think we\u2019re in a good position for us to make this move,\u201d Meador said. \u201cThere are so many advantages to making this move. I wish I had an easy answer to where this remaining funding would come from, but I just wanted to make sure everyone understood that we\u2019re not at zero. We would not be starting from scratch.\u201d Board of Supervisors Chairman Bill Martin said he was encouraged to hear that Meador believed the county could continue the continuity of service once Oct. 14 arrives. UVa\u2019s Medic 5 was providing two shifts 24 hours a day, seven days a week after the Greene County Volunteer Rescue Squad told the county last fall they could not continue to cover any shifts. \u201cI think the hard reality is that we need to plan to cover all the shifts around the clock,\u201d Taylor said. He said he has spoken with some on the volunteer board of directors about what it might take to rebuild the volunteer program, but that\u2019s not something that will happen right away. Additionally, Taylor noted that throughout the past year he\u2019s been county administrator there have been significant questions about whether two ambulances per shift was enough to cover the county. \u201cThere are broad questions about how much service is enough,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd along with that goes the question, naturally, about how much [funding] is available to provide the service.\u201d Martin said on May 4 that he has every confidence the county will find a way forward. \u201cI suspect it\u2019s going to be more of an evolution rather than a revolution to get to where we need to be, but I\u2019m confident we\u2019ll sort through the issues,\u201d he said. \u201cI said last Tuesday that this is an opportunity, in my view, to have something more homegrown and something more directly under our control.\u201d The county initiated a fire and rescue services study from the state in late January and are awaiting the results. \u201cFirst of all, I want to thank the community for donated assistance already received with the face masks and cloth face masks that were donated to us with the COVID issue,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cThat sort of pulling together, I think, is fundamental to going forward. We are doing our best to focus on the continuity of service and the continuity of care and I think the best support that the community can give at this point is listening to the board\u2019s priorities for the budget and for the path forward.\u201d Martin agreed. \u201cThere will be some kinks to work out, I\u2019m sure,\u201d Martin said. \u201cBut over time, we\u2019ll get there. So my request would be for some patience on the part of the community. This was unexpected in a tough budget year with an ongoing emergency.\u201d Rebuilding the volunteer rescue program can save the county millions of dollars in the future. Those interested in becoming an emergency medical technician, can get in touch with the squad at greeneresq.org\/contact. Taylor said he hopes to have an update at the next Board of Supervisors meeting, set for 7:30 p.m. Tuesday.","108":"Two months into self-quarantines, social distancing and the shutdown of non-essential businesses, two-thirds of Central Virginians surveyed say they not only support stay-at-home orders but are hesitant to open up the state too soon. But those whose jobs do not allow them to work remotely are more likely to favor opening the state for business on a quicker timeline, according to the survey. The survey of nearly 700 area residents by the Weldon Cooper Center for Public Service\u2019s Center for Survey Research at the University of Virginia shows people are hesitant to jump back into social situations, even if some anti-COVID-19 restrictions remain in place. The respondents were asked a series of questions between April 28 and May 5 about whether they would engage in activities under various restrictions and more favorable health conditions, such as fewer deaths, fewer cases, widespread testing and effective treatments for the virus short of a vaccine. \u201cOne of the major takeaways is that respondents are largely supportive of the current social distancing restrictions in place,\u201d said Kara Fitzgibbon, director of the Center for Survey Research. \u201cIt may be surprising to some that, even in the scenario of the stay-at-home orders being lifted and improved conditions surrounding the spread and mortality caused by COVID-19, residents are going to remain cautious and continue maintaining social distances in many ways.\u201d \u201cI was very surprised about how cautious people were regarding lifting restrictions,\u201d said Tom Guterbock, academic director at the Center for Survey Research. \u201cThey are getting out of the house and going to the grocery store, walking their pets and picking food up from restaurants, but they are hesitant to travel to other states and are opposed to opening the state up for tourists from other states.\u201d According to the results, in the last seven days, an estimated 81% of households have bought groceries; 70% have walked pets or exercised out-of-doors; 52% have picked up orders from restaurants; 44% have left to go to work; and 35% have shopped for household goods or home improvement supplies. The study shows residents are almost evenly divided about whether they approve of people traveling out of the state, but are overwhelming opposed to opening the state up to tourists from outside of Virginia. When asked if they would engage in certain activities with the lockdown lifted and conditions improved, fewer than 20% of respondents were willing to travel outside by air or train or participate in religious services, eat inside a restaurant, or attend an event at an indoor or outdoor arena without social distancing measures in place. Even with social distancing measures and an improved medical outlook, only about 45% of respondents indicated a willingness to engage in those social activities. \u201cEven under more favorable conditions, people remained quite reluctant,\u201d Guterbock said. \u201cThey\u2019re cautious about returning to their normal, pre-virus activities and are even cautious about those activities for which social distancing is provided.\u201d Guterbock noted that the survey said people were feeling economic impacts from the shutdown. Still, the majority of people were more concerned with public health than personal wealth. \u201cPeople were in pretty clear agreement, with two-thirds saying it\u2019s important to continue to keep people at home,\u201d he said. \u201cThose who are unable to continue to work from home were more likely to be in favor of easing restrictions.\u201d BeHeardCVA is the first survey panel in the state and is designed to listen to residents of the city of Charlottesville and the counties of Albemarle, Fluvanna, Greene, Louisa and Nelson. Residents may sign up to participate in a variety of surveys sponsored by the center through BeHeardCVA. In the most recent survey, questions were formulated with input from more than 300 participants with suggestions from several local nonprofits, government agencies and health officials. Topics included COVID-19 impacts on economic conditions; mental health; physical health and health care; and the effectiveness of government policies. More results will be released later this week. According to Fitzgibbon, participants in the survey were recruited through \u201cprobability and non-probability\u201d methods. \u201cSome of our panel members were randomly phoned and invited to join BeHeard out of the blue. Another large portion of the panel was invited through a scientific, randomly drawn mail-out to households in the region,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause of the importance for BeHeardCVA to be inclusive and serve as a platform for all of the voices in our community, we keep the door open to any resident who wants to join,\u201d Fitzgibbon said. \u201cSo, in addition to our probability-based recruitment, we also have panel members who have signed up because they talked with us at a community event, or heard about the panel from a friend or coworker, and others read about BeHeardCVA in The Daily Progress.\u201d To address possible bias in survey results, the results are weighted to match demographic characteristics of the region. The researchers also have analyzed the results to show how different demographics or circumstances affect responses. \u201cFor example, we see that respondents who have a job that they are unable to perform from home prioritize re-opening businesses at a higher rate,\u201d Fitzgibbon said. Guterbock said the results show that people will be reluctant to jump back into the lives they led prior to the virus coming to Virginia. \u201cThe results imply that the new normal is not going to be the same and, for some businesses, recovering will take a long time,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the question on many people\u2019s minds is, when will life return to normal,\u201d Fitzgibbon said. \u201cThe BeHeardCVA results suggest that return to normalcy is not happening anytime soon.\u201d","109":"A vast majority of Central Virginians surveyed say they have not been tested for COVID-19 and have no symptoms but a third of them say they have friends or family members who have tested positive for the disease, according to a recent survey by the University of Virginia\u2019s Weldon Cooper Center for Public Service. The BeHeardCVA survey queried 683 residents of the city of Charlottesville and the counties of Albemarle, Fluvanna, Greene, Louisa and Nelson between April 28 and May 5. The results released Thursday are in addition to those released earlier this week by the center. As Virginia ramps up testing for the pandemic disease, using tests that trace the active virus and antibody tests that determine if someone was previously exposed, almost half of respondents felt that, if needed, they could get a test for COVID-19 in the next two months. Almost 70% indicated they would likely get an antibody test to determine if they had previously been exposed to the virus when those tests become available in the region. \u201cVirginia ranks very low compared to other states in the per-capita rate of testing for COVID-19. That\u2019s true in our part of the state as well,\u201d said Tom Guterbock, academic director at the Weldon Cooper Center\u2019s Center for Survey Research, which directed the survey. \u201c5.3% say they have had COVID-19-like symptoms, but less than 2% of survey respondents have had a COVID-19 test.\u201d BeHeardCVA is the first survey panel in the state of Virginia. It is made up of volunteer respondents, some of whom were recruited randomly through phone calls and mailings and others who signed up to participate. The panel is designed to give voice to the diverse population in Central Virginia. Questions were formulated using input from more than 300 BeHeardCVA participants and suggestions from several local nonprofits, government agencies and health officials. Not surprisingly, those who reported having friends or relatives testing positive for the coronavirus were most in favor of keeping stay-at-home policies and restrictions on business operations in place, with 86% supporting the lockdown compared with 14% in favoring of opening up for business. Of those who don\u2019t personally know anyone exposed to the disease, 69% favored the restrictions. Women were more likely to support the shutdown and men more likely to want to reopen. Guterbock said he found the results interesting in light of this week\u2019s decision by the Wisconsin Supreme Court that overturned the Wisconsin governor\u2019s shutdown order. \u201cIt\u2019s interesting to see what residents in our area think about the legality of the shutdown and stay-at-home orders in our state. Across the region, 62% say restrictions are fully legal; 23% think they are legally questionable; and 6% say they are clear violations of constitutional rights,\u201d Guterbock said. \u201cThese opinions vary across our region: In Louisa County, only 43% think the shutdown is fully legally, contrasting with 80% in the city of Charlottesville,\u201d he said. Opinions also vary across the region on whether Gov. Ralph Northam\u2019s restrictions and efforts by the state to control the virus through social constraints is too much, too little, or just right. \u201cAcross the region, 62% say the state is \u201cdoing the right amount\u201d and only 14% think the state government is doing too much,\u201d he said. \u201cBut in Louisa and Greene counties, the percent who say the state is doing too much is twice as high, while in Charlottesville, just 5% say it\u2019s too much.\u201d About 75% of respondents said they trust Centers for Disease Control and Prevention officials for information about COVID-19 and about 66% trust Northam. About 70% of respondents said they do not trust President Donald Trump as a source of information on the pandemic. Guterbock said it appears that the results are likely influenced by politics and geography. \u201cI believe opinions differ on the shutdown partly because of partisan sentiments; there are not many Republicans living in Charlottesville,\u201d he said. \u201cBut they also reflect real differences in people\u2019s circumstances, such as who is not able to work from home and whether you live in an area where COVID-19 cases are rarer.\u201d About 16% of the survey\u2019s respondents own their own businesses. Of those, 60% said the restrictions have had either negative or very negative impacts on the business, and a third of business owners said they have applied for disaster loans. About 20% of all respondents who are employed said they could lose their jobs in the next three months. While some communities have seen the wearing of face masks in public become a flashpoint, 96% of Central Virginians in the survey said they have a mask and 80% say they wear it at least occasionally. About 90% wear masks at stores, 40% in any public place, 21% wear their `smasks at work and 19% wear them at hospitals, clinics or when visiting health care providers. \u201cThere\u2019s been some worry about the availability of masks for the general public but that doesn\u2019t seem to be a problem in our area,\u201d Guterbock said. \u201cBut only two-thirds say they wear a mask \u2018frequently\u2019 when away from home.\u201d Respondents also worry that their families could be impacted by the virus more so than themselves. \u201cThis trend holds regardless of the respondent\u2019s age, though we do see younger respondents reporting the highest average level anxiety, a 7.1 on a scale of 0 to 10,\u201d said Kara Fitzgibbon, director of the Center for Survey Research. \u201cAnother concern is how the pandemic is affecting mental health, and residents are indeed feeling the effects. Nearly 80% of respondents report feeling some level of impact on their mental health and emotional well-being, with 17% reporting a serious impact.\u201d Results from this survey, along with graphic representations of findings, are available at beheardcva.org\/page\/beheardcva-coronavirus-ii-survey-april-may-2020. Survey results were weighted to reflect the demographic characteristics of the region, resulting in a statistical margin of error of plus or minus 7 points.","110":"Everything was spic and span. All nurses, doctors and other staff who entered my room wore all the appropriate protective equipment, including robe, mask, gloves. They repeatedly sanitized their hands. There was repeated disinfecting in my ER isolation room, including wiping down door handles, surrounding areas and nearby walls. It was a continual amount of hard work done by several of the staff. Nurses in the ER seemed especially gentle. I found it hard to believe that I could sleep through the night while my vital signs were taken every four hours; yet I was not awakened. Finally, a good night\u2019s sleep!\u00a0 When my COVID-19 test came back negative, I was moved into a room. There the gracious hospitality continued. It was there that it occurred to me that the word \u201chospital\u201d must be connected to the word \u201chospitality.\u201d In one room, I had a roommate who needed a lot of extra attention. With her, the nurses showed their exceptional amount of patience. At the risk of my credibility, I ask you to suspend your disbelief and know that my food was particularly delicious. Really, I was so comfortable that I pondered whether I could have this as my new home. I am so grateful to the UVa hospital and all its wonderful employees, many whose names I learned. It felt as if each one had become my treasured friend. I want the whole world to know what a great place that is.\u00a0 However, I would not suggest for anyone to go to the ER for a vacation. I dealt with my condition at home for several weeks before I could brave the pandemic to go to the ER. I apologize for extra work I may have caused there. My hope is for the health-care workers and all community service workers to be greatly respected, with the provision of the latest and best personal protective equipment. I pray for all those who must risk their health and the health of their families during these difficult times. May they all be generously rewarded both spiritually and financially.\u00a0 A big \u201cthank you\u201d to all associated with UVa, along with their supportive families. Great work is being done there. Sarah Litchfield Fluvanna County","111":"The novel coronavirus, previously thought to primarily attack and affects the lungs, could have a potentially devastating effect on the nervous system, brain, kidneys and heart, according to new research. A recent paper by Dr. William Brady, a professor of emergency medicine at the University of Virginia School of Medicine, and other colleagues around the country examined early reports and studies of cardiovascular complications brought on by the novel coronavirus. \u201cUnfortunately, with COVID, it seems to attack the heart as much as it attacks other systems,\u201d Brady said. Heart failure is a particular concern in patients with COVID-19. One study discussed in the paper found that almost a quarter of COVID-19 patients \u2013 24% \u2013 were suffering acute heart failure when they were first diagnosed with the coronavirus. Other viruses, such as influenza, sometimes cause heart conditions, but \u201cthe rate of issues was much lower,\u201d Brady said. The novel coronavirus, though, seems to directly attack the heart, as well as causing intense immune responses that can weaken the heart. Severe inflammation throughout the body increases the risk that fatty plaque built up in the blood vessels will rupture, leading to heart attacks and stroke. Patients with myocarditis, or inflammation of the heart muscle, are coming to the emergency room much more frequently than doctors are used to, Brady said, which has also forced teams to rethink how they deal with cardiac issues during a pandemic. Myocarditis can sometimes seem to be a heart attack, but each have different treatments and interventions, and if a patient appears to be COVID-19 positive, the nurses and doctors must take extra precautions and be patient while they sort out treatment in an environment where speed is crucial, Brady said. \u201cCare is even more individualized than it was before,\u201d he said. Of the patients with heart failure, nearly half were not known to have high blood pressure or cardiovascular disease. Another study reviewed, though, found that of 44,672 patients with COVID-19, a history of cardiovascular disease was associated with a nearly five-fold increase in the case fatality rate when compared with patients without that history, or a fatality rate of 10.5% versus 2.3%. The authors also briefly mention how potential COVID-19 treatments may interact with blood pressure and heart attack medications; both hydroxychloroquine, which has largely been discarded by researchers as a possible treatment, and remdesivir, which has shown promise in early trials and is authorized by the FDA, can affect heart rhythm. Hydroxychloroquine can cause heart damage and worsen cardiomyopathy. However, while COVID-19 appears to cause or exacerbate heart conditions, fewer people seem to be visiting hospitals for help with those conditions, according to a population study published Tuesday. Because heart conditions can become serious with even an apparently mild case of COVID-19, Brady emphasized the importance of visiting a doctor in case of a cardiac emergency or pain. \u201cI want people to know we are open for business and are providing appropriate care, and if you have an emergency, you should come in,\u201d he said.","112":"RICHMOND \u2014 After an initial delay, the Virginia Department of Health on Tuesday released the names of 55 hospitals to receive a share of remdesivir \u2014 currently the only drug with proven, though moderate, effects against severe cases of COVID-19. As the Mercury reported last week, Virginia was one of several states to receive a shipment of remdesivir from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, part of a donation from Gilead Sciences, the drug\u2019s manufacturer. While VDH received its first allotment of 10 cases early last week, the agency initially declined to release the names of the 19 facilities to receive the shipment, which included enough medication to treat approximately 36 patients. VDH worked with the Virginia Hospital and Healthcare Association to select the facilities through a \u201crandom selection model\u201d that took into account COVID-19 case numbers and hospital need. But Parham Jaberi, the chief deputy commissioner at VDH, said Friday that the state would not release the names of the hospitals until it had received its second, larger shipment of remdesivir \u2013 an allotment of 96 cases with enough medication to treat between 350 and 400 patients. There are currently 1,024 patients across Virginia who are hospitalized with confirmed cases of COVID-19. Only hospitalized patients are currently eligible to receive the drug. \u201cThe consensus is that [the first shipment] is only enough for 36, potentially more, depending on how it\u2019s used,\u201d Jaberi said. \u201cAnd sharing that information, in terms of the public health value, and potentially setting up questions and concerns about one hospital versus another, we\u2019re really weighing that.\u201d Those 19 facilities were disclosed Tuesday in a spreadsheet that also included the names of hospitals that received the second shipment. Included in the initial distribution were five facilities in Richmond and surrounding counties \u2014 including VCU Health System, Chippenham Hospital, and Bon Secours St. Mary\u2019s Hospital \u2014 as well as several in the Hampton Roads region, where one of the state\u2019s first COVID-19 outbreaks occurred. All but three of those hospitals (John Randolph Medical Center, Lonesome Pine Hospital and Sentara Virginia Beach General Hospital) have received second shipments of the drug, according to the VDH spreadsheet. Thirty-six additional facilities were added to the second distribution list on May 17, including the University of Virginia Medical Center, Carilion Medical Center and seven more hospitals within the Sentara Healthcare system. Julian Walker, the vice president of communications for VHHA, said that the three hospitals who did not receive second shipments had already received enough dosages to meet their patients\u2019 needs. Health Commissioner Dr. Norman Oliver said Monday that coronavirus patients across Virginia had an equal chance of receiving the state\u2019s limited share of the drug, regardless of where they were hospitalized. \u201cIt\u2019s set up in such a way that every single patient with COVID-19 has an equal opportunity, an equal chance, of getting this medication,\u201d he said at a news conference. \u201cEvery single patient has their name in the hat.\u201d","113":"For the last six years, Local Food Hub has partnered with health departments to provide low-income patients with healthy food and produce via their Food Farmacy program. In previous years, individuals were referred to the program by the health clinics and were usually seeking to make lifestyle changes to combat health issues. However, as COVID-19 \u2014 the disease caused by the novel coronavirus \u2014 spread throughout Central Virginia, disrupting jobs and causing more and more people to become food insecure, Laura Brown, director of community and policy for Local Food Hub, said the group knew it needed to expand its operation. \u201cEven before the pandemic there was a need for greater access to healthy foods and produce,\u201d Brown said. \u201cThe pandemic has, of course, disrupted every portion of the community and has only exacerbated that need.\u201d Last year, Brown said Fresh Farmacy served 283 individuals and anticipated serving the same population this year. However, in just one week in May the program served nearly double that. As part of this effort, Brown said the group reached out to UVa for assistance, knowing that the university had scaled back its own food services amid the pandemic and cancellation of in-person classes. Denise Herndon, program director for economic development at UVa, said the university was happy to assist Local Food Hub and in just the first two weeks of May helped pack and distribute more than 500 bags of food. Though the contents of the bags and the number of individuals they\u2019re distributed change from week to week, UVa is on track to pack and distribute 500 bags a week. \u201c[UVA President Jim Ryan] has made it a clear priority to be a good neighbor to the community and to provide support when we can,\u201d Herndon said. \u201cThis seemed like a great opportunity to help fill a need in the community.\u201d As part of their efforts, UVa Dining and Aramark workers pack paper grocery bags with produce and goods, all sourced from local farm partners, who according to Brown have also felt the economic impact of the pandemic. \u201cOur growers\u2019 world changed overnight too, leading them to lose traditional sales from local restaurants and even UVa,\u201d she said. \u201cBy expanding our operations we\u2019ve been able to buy some of that produce and distribute it to people in need.\u201d Local Food Hub has also adapted its health-provider referral system to expand who receives food, now not only seeking to provide supplies to individuals with health-issues, such as diabetes or obesity. \u201cWhile encouraging better health remains the underlying focus of Fresh Farmacy, we\u2019re also focused on expanding access to fresh foods and vegetables and supporting family farms,\u201d Brown said. \u201cUVa handling much of the logistical work we\u2019re unable to has freed up a lot of time for us to focus on other things.\u201d According to Brown and Herndon, the partnership is expected to last until Aug. 1, around the time classes may resume, though both emphasized that the situation is fluid and may change before that date. Local Food Hub has secured other community partners to assist after August, according to Brown. However, even after the pandemic passes, Brown said she expects the need for Fresh Farmacy\u2019s expanded operations to exist. \u201cFood access issues existed before the pandemic and while we hope the barriers are lessened after it winds down, we know there are going to be lasting impacts,\u201d she said.","114":"Nau, a 1968 graduate who majored in history, made the donation to support the College and Graduate School of Arts & Sciences\u2019 recently launched Democracy Initiative and its program on constitutionalism and democracy. Nau, a former Board of Visitors member, requested that $2 million be directed to the dean of the College as an unrestricted gift; such money is useful as universities wrestle with expenses related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The donation will be matched by more than $17 million, mostly through the Bicentennial Professors Fund matching program. The money will create 10 endowed faculty positions across a range of departments, up to four visiting positions and provide additional program and research funding, according to the university.","115":"In a video call earlier this month, executive staff with the University of Virginia Health System gave employees more information around the potentially \u201cprecarious\u201d financials of the institution. Last month, the UVa Medical Center announced pay cuts and furloughs as it saw surgeries and clinical visits drop by 70% and 90%, respectively, following Gov. Ralph Northam\u2019s order halting elective procedures. The changes led to a projected deficit of $85 million a month. During a virtual meeting between School of Medicine faculty in the University Faculty Senate and health system leadership, Dr. K. Craig Kent, executive vice president for health affairs, said that this past year, UVa Health had a budget margin of \u201cessentially zero.\u201d \u201cWe had a budgeted margin of $7 million on an almost $3 billion base,\u201d he said, in response to a submitted question about a \u201cperceived lack of transparency around the decision to proceed with salary cuts and furloughs,\u201d while sister institutions such as VCU Health made less severe cuts. With a small margin and a growing defict, UVa very quickly was looking at running into trouble, Kent said. \u201c...For us, we immediately... we were in the negative,\u201d he said. \u201cSo that puts us in a little more of a precarious position than say one of our competitors or one of our allies in academic medicine that started with a fairly significant margin.\u201d He said the health system had $900 million in reserves, which includes an endowment and other restricted funds. Some of the reserves were in investments, which decreased when the stock market dropped, Kent said. \u201cThen some of that we\u2019ve already spent, because in the month of March we lost around $30 million, in the month of April, we lost $85 million,\u201d Kent said. \u201cSo we\u2019re down to the high six hundreds. So if you then continued to subtract $85 [million] from that every month without any financial mitigation... at some point, you get close to not being solvent.\u201d When asked why the health system\u2019s reserves were low compared to other institutions, Kent said he was still trying to figure that out, as he had only been at UVa since February. He said there is a fair amount of funds flowing from the clinical side to the academic side, which means less to put away in the bank, as well as that the payer mix, which refers to revenue from private, governmental and investments, isn\u2019t as good as other systems\u2019. \u201cI alluded to the fact earlier that I don\u2019t think that we\u2019ve run very efficiently over the years in all parts of the health system,\u201d Kent said. \u201cSo if you don\u2019t run more efficiently, you don\u2019t make as much money, and you don\u2019t have as many reserves and you can\u2019t devote as much money to the academic mission.\u201d UVa recently restarted elective procedures in an attempt to revive revenues. Still, more than 600 employees in the health system and School of Medicine have been furloughed as part of the effort to help reduce costs, in addition to employees who have received pay cuts. As of mid-May, 561 health system employees and 78 School of Medicine employees have been placed on full-time, unpaid furlough. For palliative care liaison nurse Jonathan Bartels, furlough has been emotionally difficult. \u201cI love the patients that I interact with and the nursing staff that are taking direct care with those patients,\u201d he said. \u201cAll that, I really miss a lot. I miss being able to really do what I do best, which is that.\u201d He\u2019s currently furloughed until July 26, with the possibility of being pulled back in as patient numbers start to increase. Hospital spokesman Eric Swensen said the number of employees on a schedule adjustment will change frequently because staffing will be adjusted if patient care volumes increase. A 22-year employee of UVa, Bartels said he hopes that these furloughs help address the bottom line. \u201cWhat they\u2019ve done is they\u2019ve helped my peers get back to work, and they\u2019ve helped the hospital open up more to be able to provide a bigger scope of care for the community,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m willing, of course, to do the furlough, if that\u2019s going to help us stay viable and continue into the future.\u201d Originally, a UVa HR webpage said that medical center staff treating COVID-19 patients will not see any adjustment to their compensation or their jobs, but that statement was later removed. The webpage now requires a university login to view. Swensen said that at this time, there is a low number of COVID-19 patients in the hospital. \u201cStaff currently involved in treating these patients have not seen a reduction in hours,\u201d he said in an email. \u201cPhysicians in constant care of COVID-19 patients have not received a reduction in compensation.\u201d But some employees who deal directly with COVID-positive patients have reported compensation changes. One health system doctor, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of losing their job, said pay cuts to those who have been treating COVID-19 patients is a \u201cslap in the face.\u201d \u201cI feel like our work is more stressful, more taxing than it\u2019s been, and rather than recognizing that, they\u2019re cutting our pay,\u201d he said. Even though there may be fewer patients in the hospital overall, employees said the work remains hard and is different than doctors are used to. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of effort both physically \u2014 getting into all the [personal protective equipment] \u2014 and mentally for every single patient who comes in, wondering if you\u2019re increasing your risk or their risk, or bringing in to a different patient, or to your family exposing them to COVID,\u201d the doctor said. During the call with faculty, Kent said that that in addition to making sure the health system can remain solvent and open for business, officials also need to make sure it has enough money to be an academic medical center. \u201cThe difference between a community enterprise and an academic medical center is we spend a whole lot of money on research, education and community, and all those other things,\u201d Kent said. \u201cThat takes money in addition to what we might spend on the clinical enterprise.\u201d Coming out of the pandemic, Kent said the organization is going to be different. \u201cIt should be different,\u201d he said. \u201cWe should seize on this opportunity to find out how to be more efficient. We should seize on this opportunity to decide what are the programs that we really value and we want to invest in and enhance, and what are the programs that maybe are not as valuable.\u201d Another question on the call came from the basic science departments regarding why positions that are fully grant-funded by the National Institutes of Health have also had salary reductions. Kent said salary reductions accrue to the overall grant and a portion of it can be carried over to the next year. \u201cThen I have that resource available when COVID lifts and I can get my people back into the laboratory, to then pay my tech to be able to do the research that was originally designed in the grant,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s actually a positive thing for investigators.\u201d School of Medicine Dean Dr. David S. Wilkes said the university is still waiting for set guidelines from NIH. Swensen said the health system also has taken other steps to reduce costs, including reducing spending on medical supplies and pharmacy, reducing overtime, limiting work with contract staff, revisiting and adjusting facility lease commitments, eliminating non-essential travel, reducing discretionary spending and drawing on some reserves. Bartels said despite the difficulties, it has been nice to have some time off and he is doing OK financially. \u201cI\u2019ve had to file for unemployment, and that\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve ever had to do that in my 33 years of working, and that was difficult,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was very humbling to do.\u201d He\u2019s an ambassador for the Compassionate Care Initiative at UVa, which teaches health workers resilience and compassion in health care, but he can\u2019t go into the health system to provide that training while on furlough. \u201cI\u2019ve had a lot of nurses reach out to me through social media to have questions answered and have that type of support I would normally offer within the hospital,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m now doing it through social media, just because that\u2019s their way to contact me and that\u2019s my way to help them out.\u201d \u201cFor me, it\u2019s my passion,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m going to continue to do my passion.\u201d","116":"COVID-19 affects different communities in different ways. That is frustrating and unacceptable, Dr. Cameron Webb, an internal medicine doctor at the University of Virginia Medical Center, said Saturday during a virtual town hall hosted by Albemarle County high school students. \u201cIt\u2019s frustrating and it\u2019s frightening as a provider when you see the people who look like you are the ones who are filling the beds in the hospital with a disease that we don\u2019t fully understand,\u201d said Webb, who\u2019s also the director of health policy and equity at the University of Virginia and is running for the Democratic nomination for Virginia\u2019s 5th Congressional District. Health disparities and the broader COVID-19 pandemic were the focus of the town hall, which also included Janice Underwood, the state\u2019s chief diversity officer, and Lawrence Pilkey, who works in Sentara Martha Jefferson Hospital\u2019s Intensive Care Unit. They fielded questions about the virus, the role of social media in the pandemic and why the disease is disproportionately affecting communities of color. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to look at this from the perspective of what shapes chronic disease in our community because health doesn\u2019t happen in hospitals; it happens in communities,\u201d Webb said. \u201cIt happens where we\u2019re born, grow, live, learn, eat, play and pray.\u201d As of Saturday, 402 people in the Thomas Jefferson Health District have tested positive for COVID-19. African Americans account for a quarter of the 16 fatalities in the area, 27% of the cases and more than half of the 68 hospitalizations, trends that have held steady since the health district started releasing demographic data in early April. Naquel Perry Jr., a rising senior at Albemarle High School, moderated the town hall. More than 50 people joined the Zoom call. Webb and other doctors have pushed for better demographic data about the positive cases in the state. Statewide, African Americans make up nearly 22% of the cases in which race is known, and Hispanics account for almost half of the cases in which ethnicity is known. As of Saturday, race and ethnicity is unknown for about one-third of the state\u2019s 35,749 cases. Webb was a few minutes late to the virtual town hall, held over Zoom, because he was assisting with pop-up testing sites for communities of color in Charlottesville. UVa and Martha Jefferson performed the COVID-19 tests at the Jefferson School City Center and Mt. Zion First African Baptist Church from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Webb said more than 300 tests were administered across the two locations \u2014 he and public information officers said 174 occurred at Mt. Zion and 150 occurred at the Jefferson School. With the testings, Webb said doctors are not just showing up, testing individuals and sending them on their way. They have to build trust with the communities. \u201cMy patients themselves went to segregated wards,\u201d he said, referring to the old University Hospital, which until the 1960s separated black and white patients. \u201cAnd so the reality is we have to acknowledge that history and evaluate that when we say testing for coronavirus for this new and scary disease that\u2019s gonna have a different impact on different communities. We had to start by gaining that trust, I believe.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s what seeing this through an anti-racist lens looks like, because to me it means that we\u2019re reversing those systemic structures that are in place that are creating the dynamics and health that we\u2019re seeing,\u201d he said. Underwood had been working to create a state strategic plan for diversity, equity and inclusion, but that campaign paused during the pandemic. Now, she\u2019s leading a health equity task force that has worked to provide personal protective equipment to those who can\u2019t socially distance or stay at home and has focused on testing communities of color across the state. \u201cBecause what we realized is that those structural inequities that we were fighting against have bubbled up and we see a disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on communities of color, in particular, black and Latino communities,\u201d she said. \u201c... These structural and racial inequities didn\u2019t start with COVID-19 and they\u2019re certainly not going to end with COVID-19.\u201d She also encouraged students on the committee and those at the town hall to ask their parents and other adults if they\u2019ve completed the 2020 census and to vote in elections. Pilkey also provided information about the virus and research into it. He advised students to be skeptical about studies regarding the virus and to look at the sources to try to figure out the validity of the data. Before the pandemic, the students behind the town hall were part of a committee to implement the school division\u2019s anti-racism policy, which was drafted by students and adopted in February 2019. The policy established reporting requirements on disciplinary actions and racial disparities throughout the division and mandated anti-racism training for staff, a more transparent process for class recommendations and the creation of anti-racist curriculum. Division staff have worked in the last year to devise a plan to carry out the various provisions of the policy. One such provision called for the creation of a student committee to assist with the policy. The students named their leadership committee the Student Equity & Advisory Team, or SEAT, to highlight the importance of everyone having a place at the table.","117":"At least some University of Virginia students likely will be able to return to Grounds in August, though their semester will be abnormal. In an email from President Jim Ryan on Thursday, some details of the fall semester were presented, including an on-time start to the semester of Aug. 25. Many issues \u2014 such as whether tuition and fees would increase as planned \u2014 are yet to be detailed, and all come with caveats. A variety of changes and safety measures are anticipated, including keeping large classes and those taught by staff with health concerns online; allowing most students to attend class virtually; and testing and conducting contact tracing for those with COVID-19. Ryan\u2019s email, which is also signed by other executives, emphasizes the university\u2019s belief in the importance of the residential campus. \u201cWe also appreciate that learning remotely is much harder for some students than others, given different living arrangements, family circumstances and family obligations,\u201d Ryan wrote. \u201cThere is also no end in reasonable sight for this virus, which makes it even more imperative that we do our best to adapt.\u201d Another anticipated and significant change is the length of the in-person semester, which will see students not return to Grounds after Thanksgiving. Students would not return until January, which officials hope will minimize the inevitable risk associated with travel back and forth to Charlottesville. UVa is still determining if exams can be hosted before Thanksgiving or whether they will be offered remotely. Additionally, UVa is developing protocols for testing, tracing and isolating people who test positive for COVID-19, as well as identifying spaces to quarantine on-Grounds residents exposed to those who have contracted COVID-19. The university is working to acquire personal protective equipment, such as masks, for students and staff and is developing social distancing guidelines. No further details were available as of press time Thursday. \u201cThis fall will not be a normal fall, even with some students back on Grounds and some classes being held in person,\u201d Ryan wrote. \u201cThere inevitably will be greater risk in having students return, and we will be placing a good deal of trust in our students to look out for the safety and well-being not just of each other but of our faculty, staff, and community members.\u201d These details were discussed Wednesday in a video conference with UVa faculty. The email couches the announcements as \u201cplanning assumptions.\u201d A more formal announcement is expected in mid-June. One aspect not addressed in the email is whether UVa will continue with a previously approved tuition rate increase, despite financial hardships caused by the coronavirus pandemic. In December, the Board of Visitors voted to approve a 3.6% tuition increase for the 2020-21 academic year. Per the approved rate, tuition and mandatory fees will increase for current in-state students between $510 and $880 annually and $1,710 to $2,094 for out-of-state students. The changes apply to those in the College of Arts & Sciences, the Curry School of Education and Human Development, the School of Architecture and the McIntire School of Commerce. Some universities and colleges, including the College of William & Mary, James Madison University and the Virginia Community College System, have walked back tuition increases in the wake of the pandemic. Virginia Tech\u2019s Board of Visitors is considering no increases. UVa\u2019s Financial Analysis and Planning division did not respond to requests for clarification about whether the school would continue with its approved tuition increase. During an April 27 Board of Visitors meeting, when asked about tuition rates, Ryan indicated that no decision had yet been made. \u201cIt\u2019s our view is that the decision is tied up with what we do in the fall,\u201d he said at the meeting. \u201cIt would be premature for us to have a conversation about that at this point.\u201d The issue also was not broached during the public portion of the board\u2019s May 18 meeting. UVa\u2019s planning efforts involve surveys sent to undergraduate students, graduate students, faculty and staff seeking input for recommendation for the next academic year. About 73% of the 12,300 undergraduates surveyed responded, according to the university, and 92% of respondents \u201cagreed\u201d or \u201csomewhat agreed\u201d to practice safety behaviors such as frequent hand-washing, masking and social distancing. And 86% \u201cagreed\u201d or \u201csomewhat agreed\u201d to hold their peers accountable on those measures. Brian Coy, a UVa spokesman, said Ryan and the university are expected to announce plans for the fall semester by mid-June. James Toscano, of Partners For College Affordability and Public Trust, said he hopes UVa revisits its fall tuition decision in light of the financial and public health crisis. \u201cSo often, Virginia looks to UVa for leadership when it comes to higher education, but in this case, UVa needs to look for others when it comes to how to treat Virginians as a result of the pandemic,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a degree of tone deafness for an institution to set a tuition rate months before one of the world\u2019s worst pandemics and not revisit that decision.\u201d Other universities and colleges have found ways to freeze tuition with more limited financial resources, Toscano said. \u201cThere is an urgency to this situation \u2014 families are having to make budgetary decisions and they\u2019re having to make trade-offs,\u201d he said. \u201cAround the country there is a conversation going on, and UVa needs to consider that.\u201d","118":"RICHMOND \u2014 Virginia\u2019s COVID-19 restrictions prevented more than 700,000 cases of the virus, but new cases are expected to peak at between 5,000 and 9,300 a day in late July or early August, according to updated modeling from the University of Virginia. All of Virginia on Friday will have loosened some of the measures Gov. Ralph Northam ordered to help mitigate the spread of the virus, which has killed more than 1,300 people in the state, according to state data. But researchers at UVa say the state isn\u2019t in the clear yet. \u201cWe\u2019re where we are today because of Virginians and I say thank you to all of them,\u201d Northam said at a news conference Thursday. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a long road ahead of us, and the only way we\u2019re going to get through this is to put the politics aside, put the jabs aside and just be part of the solution.\u201d When the peak of new weekly cases comes, and how severe it is, depends on the extent to which residents practice social distancing, researchers say. Under a \u201clight rebound,\u201d where interactions return to one-sixth of pre-pandemic levels, Virginia\u2019s peak of new confirmed cases is projected to come during the week ending Aug. 9, according to the latest UVa model. If residents interact even more, returning to one-third of pre-pandemic levels, the model suggests, the peak will be higher (65,454 new confirmed cases compared with 38,546) and come the week ending July 26. \u201cThis disease is very much with us,\u201d said Madhav Marathe, a researcher with UVa\u2019s Biocomplexity Institute, which created the model that is among a few being used by state leaders. \u201cWe can\u2019t let our guard down. That doesn\u2019t mean that we can\u2019t interact, but people need to be very cognizant. This disease has not been eliminated.\u201d He added: \u201cIf we work together as a collective, we have a far better chance of managing this rather than having a fractured way of doing this.\u201d Northam in March ordered non-essential businesses to close, banned in-person gatherings of more than 10 people and closed school buildings for the rest of the academic year, among other steps. Earlier this week, he mandated that, beginning Friday, masks be worn in public buildings and businesses, some of which have reopened as part of the state\u2019s first reopening phase. Richmond, Northern Virginia and Accomack County, the exceptions to Phase One, which started for the rest of the state May 15, are set to enter that first phase on Friday. Northam said Thursday that Virginia will remain in Phase One for at least another week. The restrictions the state has put in place so far, labeled by the researchers as \u201ccommunity mitigation strategies,\u201d have prevented 710,144 confirmed cases of the virus, the model estimates. \u201c[The restrictions] did in fact slow down the spread of this disease and let folks get their arms around it,\u201d said Chris Barrett, executive director of the UVa Biocomplexity Institute. The measures, the researchers said, bought the state more time to increase its testing capacity \u2014 an issue Virginia has struggled with worse than other states \u2014 and purchase more personal protective equipment, among other things. \u201cIt\u2019s not completely out of the woods, but it\u2019s better,\u201d said Bryan Lewis, one of the UVa researchers.","119":"Zhen Yan, an expert on exercise and its impacts at the cellular level, said the new research method allows lab rodents to work out on their own schedules and without human intervention. That helps researchers determine how weight-bearing exercises affect the mice, and probably humans \u2014 from their muscles and organs to cells and genes. Yan is director of the Center for Skeletal Muscle Research at UVa\u2019s Robert M. Berne Cardiovascular Research Center. He recently found a link between exercise and surviving acute respiratory distress syndrome, a major cause of death from COVID-19. \u201cWhen we\u2019re talking about the benefits of exercise, everyone understands how important it is but the reality is we know very little about how it impacts the body. We only know the tip of the iceberg,\u201d Yan said. \u201cThe more we understand, the more we can try to energize the general public to exercise and take advantage of the information we\u2019ve learned to improve health.\u201d The study of rodents running wheels in their cages helped researchers to pin down the advantages to aerobic exercises such as walking and running, but Yan said weight-bearing exercises are not as well understood from a metabolic angle. \u201cWe know a good deal about aerobic exercise. We know a lot because of the animal model. You can measure the effects of aerobic exercise on rodents who are running in their cages and doing so on their own,\u201d Yan said. \u201cWhat we don\u2019t have is a good model for weight training that doesn\u2019t involve a human intervention.\u201d Methods used to study rodents and weight training tend to over-develop muscles and require the animal to use the muscle group all of the time, Yan said. \u201cThe research involves a procedure that is difficult, tedious and requires human handling and it results in the muscles being worked 24-7,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t lift weights for 24 hours a day, and it\u2019s hard to measure how the exercise is beneficial.\u201d Like most research, the problem led to inspiration, which led to exploration, which led to discovery. \u201cI worked in the garage and made prototypes, trying to figure out how this could work,\u201d Yan said. \u201cI fabricated a cage top that took advantage of the feeding behavior of rodents at night. We put a plate on a hinge attached to one side and food.\u201d Without humans forcing them to pump iron or use a muscle group, the rodents went scurrying about their nocturnal business. That business includes eating, and that\u2019s where Yan\u2019s cage top came into play. To get to the nuggets of food, the rodent would need to lift the cage top using a squat-like maneuver, same as athletes and gym members do. The impact of the exercise on rodent legs could then be extrapolated to their human counterparts. \u201cWe\u2019ve discovered that the movements build muscle very consistent with the way humans build muscle in the gym,\u201d Yan said. Those muscle impacts also led to muscled mice with thicker bones and improved ability to utilize insulin. \u201cAs we age, we add more body fat, our bones grow weaker and we are at greater risk of diabetes,\u201d Yan said. \u201cThis tells us that we may be able to use weightlifting to help in the treatment of diabetes and address problems of aging such as osteoporosis and loss of muscle mass, things that concern everyone over 40.\u201d Learning how weight-bearing exercise impacts the body at the cellular level also could lead to medications down the road. \u201cWe understand why exercise is very important, but we know very little about exactly what it does, and this helps us see the impacts more clearly,\u201d Yan said. \u201cI imagine we will never generate a pill to get all of the benefits of exercise and exercise will still be the best alternative compared to pharmacological intervention. But we may be able to develop drugs that can mimic the benefits of exercise in some ways to help those who cannot exercise because of medical problems or disabilities.\u201d Yan said the research is just beginning. \u201cThe findings are truly the tip of the iceberg,\u201d he said. \u201cWe hope many researchers in the scientific community can use this model to unveil the effective exercise secrets to benefit the general public.\u201d","120":"The University of Virginia will not require students to take either the SAT or ACT when applying this fall. Provost Liz Magill said that with the COVID-19 pandemic, this was an easy call for officials, and one other universities have made in recent weeks. University officials will use this admissions cycle to learn about the impact of the policy change and decide next spring whether to extend the pilot. \u201cOur admissions office will continue to offer a comprehensive and holistic review of every application, and applicants won\u2019t be at a disadvantage if they don\u2019t submit test scores,\u201d Magill said during a Board of Visitors meeting Thursday. The pandemic, which closed schools and other businesses and pushed UVa online, disrupted in-person spring SAT and ACT testing. College Board, the organization that administers the SAT, asked colleges and universities Tuesday to be flexible with their testing requirements as it announced it was suspending an at-home SAT option. Magill noted other challenges with the SAT this year, including difficulties with the registration system and uncertainty about whether testing centers will be open. \u201c[These disruptions] underscore the fact that every college, including us at the university, needs to ensure as level of a playing field as possible in a year we don\u2019t even know whether high schools are going to be open or test centers will be able to administer tests,\u201d Magill said. More than two dozen colleges have decided to waive testing requirements due to the pandemic, The New York Times reported last month, with the University of California system voting to phase them out entirely. UVa\u2019s pilot policy applies to all applicants for undergraduate admission. UVa also is pushing back its early decision application deadline to Nov. 1. The university is planning to start the 2020-21 school year on-time and end in-person classes by Thanksgiving. A more detailed plan for fall classes is expected mid-June. Racial issues Earlier this week, UVa President Jim Ryan announced a task force that will make recommendations to improve racial equity at the university. On Thursday, he discussed the task force and addressed national protests that have taken place since George Floyd, a black man, died under the knee of a Minneapolis police officer May 25. \u201cOur faculty, students and staff, especially those of color, are angry, upset and worried, understandably so,\u201d Ryan said. \u201c... They are looking to us as leaders, not just to talk about this, but to do something here at UVa, to make the university more equitable, more inclusive and more welcoming for all students, faculty and staff but especially for those of color who have not always felt that way.\u201d A letter signed by hundreds of students and staff members calls on Ryan to make substantial changes to address racial injustices and inequalities that African American students face at UVa and outlined 15 steps for change. Board member Barbara Fried and student representative Mazzen Shalaby supported \u201cimmediately\u201d creating a course about race and ethnic relations in America for all students to take \u2014 which would meet one of the student demands. \u201cI think there is a hunger on the part of the students, not just for a thoughtful analysis, which we will have to have, something immediate that says, we get it,\u201d Fried said. Tuition increase remains Also on Thursday, board members approved a $3.85 billion operating budget for UVa\u2019s academic division, the Medical Center and the College at Wise that was drafted before the pandemic started. A revised budget will be presented in September after officials have more information about how much state funding may decrease and the pandemic\u2019s impact on other financial metrics. J.J. Davis, UVa\u2019s chief operating officer, said she expects the revised budget to be smaller than what board members approved Thursday. Rector Jim Murray said the tuition increase approved in December remains unchanged, though board members could look at that decision in September as part of the revised budget. Ryan said a commitment to meeting and expanding financial aid, as outlined in a recent strategic plan, remains critical. Other schools in the state have made changes to upcoming tuition rates. Building name change Also, on Thursday, the board voted to rename Ruffner Hall, part of the Curry School of Education and Human Development, in honor of Walter Ridley, the first African American to earn a doctoral degree from UVa. Earlier this spring, Dean Robert Pianta recommended changing the name of Ruffner and the school itself following an extensive review first announced in November 2018. Ruffner was a former superintendent of Virginia\u2019s public schools and first president of what is now Longwood University. However, the university said his accomplishments were overshadowed by his clear support for segregation and his stated belief that African Americans were intellectually and morally inferior to whites. \u201cWe are delighted to celebrate Walter Ridley\u2019s pathbreaking leadership and contributions to education and society,\u201d Pianta said in a statement. \u201cAs a school dedicated to realizing human potential, we can look to Mr. Ridley\u2019s writing, statements and actions as models for engaging in our work.\u201d The board will consider the proposal for removing Curry as the namesake of the education school at a later date, the university said in a news release.","121":"The University of Virginia will spend nearly $400,000 to purchase masks and protective gear in an effort to safely reopen in the fall. The university has ordered 25,000 \u201cwelcome back kits\u201d from Bright Ideas LLC, a business in Troy. It also has ordered face masks, according to purchase orders reviewed by The Daily Progress. In an email May 28, President Jim Ryan and other officials said UVa will provide personal protective equipment for students, faculty and staff upon return. Bright Ideas, which is a small woman- and minority-owned business, will receive $288,000 for protective equipment and $89,7000 for face masks. Supply Room Companies of Ashland will receive $20,240 for 19,040 face masks. According to The Cavalier Daily, the kits will include a 14- by 18-inch drawstring bag, two cloth face masks, two 2-ounce containers of hand sanitizer and a touch tool that can be used to pull on door handles and activate keypads. UVa leveraged existing cooperative contracts to source the items, according to spokesman Brian Coy, and navigated multiple selections and orders due to supply chain fluctuations. UVa\u2019s procurement, emergency management, health and safety and facilities teams worked together to review products for quality and adherence to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines, Coy said. Last month, Gov. Ralph Northam mandated wearing masks in public buildings, including in schools and universities. UVa updated its policy book to require faculty, staff and students wear masks while inside a university facility, other buildings on Grounds, on university buses or in the presence of others. University community members who are off-site for school or work are expected to wear masks in the presence of others, and contractors, visitors and volunteers are expected to wear masks at UVa, as well. \u201cAppropriate use of face coverings or face masks is critical in minimizing risks to others near you,\u201d the policy reads. UVa\u2019s policy went into effect Monday. Failure to comply with requirements of the policy can result in disciplinary action, according to the policy. UVa currently plans to start the fall semester on Aug. 25 with a variety of safety and public health efforts. Measures include keeping large classes and those taught by staff with health concerns online; allowing most students to attend class virtually; and testing and conducting contact tracing for those with COVID-19. More details on how the school expects to enact such measures are expected later this month.","122":"The Thomas Jefferson Health District is almost done hiring a five-person team that will help staff a series of COVID-19 testing sites throughout the summer and fall. New members of the team tested community members at four clinics this week. The district is planning to hold two to three drive-thru clinics per week moving forward. While appointments are limited to 48 for each two-hour clinic, the district recently relaxed requirements regarding who could get tested. Now, anyone interested should be able to make an appointment or be placed on a waitlist. Before, only those showing symptoms of the disease could receive a free test through the district. \u201cWe\u2019ve never done this before,\u201d health district spokeswoman Kathryn Goodman said. \u201cIt\u2019s new to us as well as to the community. We\u2019re trying to work hard to increase as much as we can while also making sure that we can maintain the ability to offer so many testing events. We plan on leading this into the fall. We want to sustain these operations.\u201d In recent weeks, case numbers have ticked up. For seven consecutive days in May, the district reported daily double-digit increases in daily cases. As of Friday evening, 579 people have tested positive, 70 are hospitalized and 19 have died in Charlottesville and the counties of Albemarle, Fluvanna, Louisa, Greene and Nelson. \u201cToday we had four new cases, so it really is up and down,\u201d Goodman said Wednesday. \u201cWe\u2019re definitely concerned as cases increase; however, it\u2019s expected that we\u2019re going to see more cases because we\u2019re offering more testing.\u201d Friday marked the beginning of a new phase for Virginia as the economy reopens. As part of Phase Two of Gov. Ralph Northam\u2019s plan, restaurants can offer indoor dining at half capacity. Gyms also can reopen. Face masks are still required for those going inside a business. While total cases in the state and district continue to increase, the statewide rate of increase has slowed, according to department data. Between May 15 and June 5, however, confirmed cases in the district increased by 30%, a rate higher than the 15 days prior. Currently, about 6% of COVID-19 tests are positive, according to the district\u2019s seven-day average, a metric that remains below the state\u2019s average of 10.1%. Goodman said the district is continuing to trace contacts and isolate those affected when a positive case is identified, which helps to prevent the virus\u2019 spread. Still, COVID-19 testing represents only a snapshot in time since the state doesn\u2019t have the capacity for widespread surveillance testing. Appointments for the drive-thru clinics are limited because the testing team can only administer 24 tests an hour due to space and staffing constraints. If there\u2019s enough demand, the health district can extend the clinic to provide more, as they did for a Nelson County clinic recently. \u201cWe\u2019re hoping that we can continue to offer more and more of these so that people can continue to get in the flow and understand that it will be 48 people at each site,\u201d Goodman said. Next week, the district is holding clinics in Louisa and Greene County on June 9 and 10, respectively, from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m. Residents can call (434) 972-6261 to schedule an appointment. More information is available at vdh.virginia.gov\/thomas-jefferson\/covid-19-testing-sites\/. Testing for COVID-19 in Virginia has lagged behind other states, but a patchwork of hospitals and providers have steadily increased the number of tests administered in the district. On May 28, the district reached a new high \u2014 447 \u2014 of daily test encounters, according to the Virginia Department of Health. CVS has started providing drive-thru tests to those who met federal and state guidelines, and the University of Virginia and Sentara Martha Jefferson Hospital have taken on testing in Charlottesville, allowing the health district to focus on the five counties in its service area. \u201cWe\u2019re trying not to turn anyone away,\u201d Goodman said. \u201cWe know that there is a waitlist sometimes. There are a lot of people who call that we might not be able to get in for a testing event, but we\u2019ll be coming back to that locality in a week or two afterward, hoping that we can get through and get everybody tested who wants to be.\u201d UVa Medical Center and Martha Jefferson employees are tested if they show symptoms or were exposed to the virus. \u201cWe also ask employees about their health on a daily basis,\u201d said Eric Swensen, spokesman for the medical center. \u201cWe do not offer testing to asymptomatic employees, as testing is not an accurate predictor of whether an employee may develop COVID-19 at a later time due to its long incubation period.\u201d UVa also is leading the state\u2019s effort to determine how many Virginians have been infected through antibody testing, The Department of Health wants to collect blood samples in June and July from 5,000 patients \u2014 1,000 from the state\u2019s five health planning regions \u2014 that will be tested at UVa. Other hospitals are participating in the Virginia Coronavirus Serology Project. UVa will collect 1,000 samples from the \u201cnorthwest\u201d region of the state, which includes TJHD. Dr. Eric Houpt, the chief of UVa\u2019s Division of Infectious Diseases and International Health, is coordinating the project. \u201cThe confirmed COVID case counts in Virginia, or in any state, are an underestimate because testing has been incomplete and there are many cases with mild or no symptoms at all,\u201d said Houpt in a news release. \u201cThe question this project will answer is how much are we underestimating infection, how far are we from herd immunity and are we especially missing cases in certain groups or regions.\u201d Preliminary results of the project will be released no later than the end of July. For now, Goodman said the district is comfortable with its testing capacity. \u201cBut that said, of course, there still is a little bit of a shortage, so our testing events are limited,\u201d she said. \u201cBut they will be going throughout the summer.\u201d The health department\u2019s new hires have been funded by an anonymous donation; health districts and other state agencies have had budgets and hiring frozen, Goodman said. The added staffing means other workers who had been doing COVD-19 testing can go back to offering other public health services such as immunization clinics and sexual health testing. \u201cWith this testing team getting on board, it allows for our staff to go back to operating these clinics while we\u2019re also simultaneously expanding testing throughout the district for COVID,\u201d Goodman said. The donation also helped the district purchase cloth face masks to distribute throughout the surrounding counties. \u201cWe know that people are tired of being home,\u201d Goodman said. \u201cAs we enter into the new phase, it\u2019s important that people still practice the distancing as they can and wearing face coverings. We\u2019re happy to hear that people can go out more but want to make sure that we prevent further spread of COVID.\u201d","123":"Terry was one of three new members named to the commission. The others are Norfolk Police Chief Larry D. Boone and Lori Haas, senior director of advocacy with the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence, according to a news release from UVa. The 13-member commission studies and makes recommendations on all areas of public safety and protection. Terry came to the Weldon Cooper Center in 2018 from Dallas, where, according to a news release from the center, \u201che worked to improve the lives of citizens in the Dallas region and beyond, including launching the Community Leadership Academy.\u201d \u201cHe has experience working for organizations dedicated to working for restorative justice and second chances,\u201d Northam said. Terry said, \u201cAt this difficult and evocative time in our history, when we are deeply examining the role of public safety institutions and the role of the communities and individuals they serve, I am pleased to bring to the commission\u2019s work my experiences, both as executive director of UVa\u2019s Weldon Cooper Center for Public Service and in my work in Dallas empowering citizens and law enforcement leaders to make communities safer.\u201d Before his years in Dallas, Terry was an assistant professor of public administration at both Long Island University-Brooklyn and Arizona State University. \u201cJust as we at the Cooper Center are reimagining how we support and strengthen communities across Virginia, we all now must reimagine our roles in promoting our shared humanity and commitment to each other \u2014 whether it is through wearing masks to protect each other against the disease of COVID, or unmasking the systemic racism that tears at the fabric of our relationships, communities, and individual potential,\u201d Terry said in the release.","124":"This story has been updated. With a new state law concerning public statues about to take effect, Albemarle County officials are hoping residents will chime in through an online survey and virtual meetings on how the Court Square grounds in downtown Charlottesville should look. The county launched a February Court Square Community Conversations project designed to give residents a voice in how the grounds could be redesigned as an inclusive public space. The project was to include public meetings and gatherings that were quickly quashed the next month amid COVID-19 restrictions. \u201cThis important engagement process relied heavily on coming together to explore a more inclusive history and to develop a common understanding of Court Square as an important public space,\u201d officials wrote in a news release seeking public input. A law going into effect July 1 will give local governments the power to remove, relocate or put monuments into perspective. Albemarle had outlined a six-month time frame during which county staffers were to lead community conversations around memorials, monuments and uses of public space; educational tours of the Albemarle County Courthouse Historic District; and public listening sessions. The county\u2019s Office of Equity and Inclusion\u2019s equity work group, along with county staffers and members of Albemarle\u2019s Historic Preservation Committee, were to draft options for the future of the property for the Board of Supervisors to consider in June. That didn\u2019t happen. \u201cThe timing of COVID-19 and the restrictions on gathering resulted in many events being paused,\u201d officials wrote. \u201cAs a local government, many of our resources were diverted to our pandemic response.\u201d Officials said the current courthouse grounds are a hodgepodge patchwork of memorials and monuments with no design or intended meaning. \u201cThe property is home to several markers and monuments, including tributes to American presidents and Confederate soldiers, commemoration of exploration [and] a heroic ride, and memorialization of a local lynching,\u201d officials said on the county webpage addressing Court Square. \u201cEach of these markers were placed under specific circumstances, but no cohesive vision or master plan for this public space has been articulated.\u201d That, officials say, may be changed with the new law. \u201cThe legislation granting local authority over monuments and memorials for war veterans by the General Assembly earlier this year presents an opportunity for the Albemarle County Board of Supervisors to establish a vision for the space,\u201d they wrote on the website. \u201cThis important public space has not been curated to craft a narrative and to do so, we need your help,\u201d officials wrote. \u201cAlbemarle County has spent the past several weeks re-tooling the Court Square Community Conversation to invite the community to participate. As a community, we need to have conversations about what\u2019s important to us, what do we want this space to say about us, what do we want to project today and moving forward, and how do we do that at Court Square.\u201d The county has planned a virtual discussion at 6:30 p.m. June 29 on how to present multiple stories in a public setting. The meeting will be led by Sara Bon-Harper, executive director of James Monroe\u2019s Highland; Louis Nelson of the University of Virginia; and Jennifer Stacy, a member of Highland\u2019s Descendant Advisory Panel. Court Square will the topic of a virtual panel at 6 p.m. July 20 on the cultural landscape of the square and the historic significance and design of its current markers and monuments. UVa\u2019s Elgin Cleckley; Justin Reid of Virginia Humanities; Kirt von Daacke, of UVa; and Betsy Baten will serve on the panel, and Andrea Douglas, of the Jefferson School, will moderate. Two community conversations on memorials, public spaces and Court Square are scheduled for July, as well. The first takes place at 6 p.m. July 8, while the second is scheduled for noon July 24. Links to join the virtual discussions will be posted at publicinput.com\/courtsquare closer to the time of the events. The county has opened a survey for local comment on the same site.","125":"As the COVID-19 pandemic hit in March, Roger Dean Huffstetler, John Lesinski, Claire Russo and Dr. Cameron Webb were faced with the unprecedented challenge of campaigning with very limited human contact. Door-knocking was replaced with texts and phone calls, and candidate forums were relegated to digital platforms. Nevertheless, in recent interviews with The Daily Progress, each candidate said they think potential voters are still engaged with the process and all highlighted the success of their voter outreach efforts. Whoever wins the primary will face off against Bob Good, a former Liberty University athletics official who won the Republican nomination this past weekend over Rep. Denver Riggleman, of Nelson County. Roger Dean Huffstetler Huffstetler is a Charlottesville entrepreneur who served in Afghanistan and Iraq as a Marine and later received an MBA from the Harvard School of Business. A familiar face to the 5th District, Huffstetler ran for the district\u2019s Democratic nomination in 2018, losing to Leslie Cockburn, who was beaten in the general election by Riggleman. Huffstetler led the Democratic field in donations before the caucuses in April 2018, a trend that continued this election with Huffstetler raising nearly $1 million ahead of the primary. Huffstetler\u2019s campaign has highlighted the need for access to high-quality and affordable health care, infrastructure improvement and increasing educational and economic opportunities within the district. \u201cI\u2019ve been afforded a lot of privileges and opportunities during my life, and we need to make sure all Americans and residents of the 5th District have access opportunities that will better their lives,\u201d he said. \u201cAs the pandemic winds down, we will no doubt go through some hard times and we need to make sure we\u2019re prepared.\u201d In light of recent global protests against police brutality and systemic racism, Huffstetler said he is in favor of ensuring community services, such as social services, are adequately funded. \u201cThe police can\u2019t continue to be the first line of defense against the sum of all problems in our communities,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s just way too much responsibility when there needs to be more options tailored to the situations community members find themselves in.\u201d Over the course of his two campaigns for the seat, Huffstetler said he\u2019s come to know the massive district and its mixture of rural and urban communities. The 5th District needs a strong candidate who can appeal to right-leaning and undecided voters, something Huffstetler said he can fulfill. \u201cI\u2019ve lived the American Dream, and my job in public service is to try and bridge these two communities \u2014 the right and the left,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe in my heart that I give us the best shot at turning this district blue.\u201d Huffstetler has been endorsed by Charlottesville City Councilor Heather Hill and Albemarle County Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney Jim Hingeley, among others. Hufftstetler said his many endorsements indicate his strength as a unifying candidate. John Lesinski Lesinski, a Marine veteran and Rappahannock resident, believes his service in various local government and state-appointed positions has prepared him well for Congress. Lesinski served in the Marines Corps and then settled in Virginia, where he has now lived for 35 years. In addition to his work in commercial real estate, he previously was elected to the majority Republican Rappahannock County Board of Supervisors and School Board. \u201cI really think that experience and the ability to work across the aisle are important in this election,\u201d he said. \u201cI am the only candidate here who has served in local office, and twice at that, to bodies where I was the only Democrat.\u201d As someone with ample leadership and business experience, Lesinski said he sees himself as well-situated to lead the district through what he sees as a difficult crossroads. According to Lesinski, a chief issue facing the district is climate change, a widespread and multifaceted problem that he said affects every aspect of life in the district. Renewable energy and creating better infrastructure will benefit the district in the long term, he said. However, as the COVID-19 pandemic has brought to light inequities in society, Lesinski said health care has become a more significant issue. \u201cHealth care is, of course, on everyone\u2019s minds right now, as a lack of access to affordable health services has impacted residents like never before,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that the district needs a strong leader who will fight for the right to health care.\u201d The pandemic and protests spurred by police-involved deaths of African Americans across the country have served to further highlight injustices within the United States, Lesinski said. \u201cThe issues we\u2019re seeing now cut across a lot of different spectrums: income inequality, gender inequality and racial inequality,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are a lot of things we as a society should do to address these issues and among them is limiting the legal protection for police officers who kill people on the job.\u201d Claire Russo Russo sees public service as a calling and something she said she has consistently sought to do. Also a veteran of the Marine Corps, Russo led counterinsurgency efforts in the Middle East. She sees herself as part of a wave of women veterans, such as Rep. Abigail Spanberger, D-7th, who have won House seats across the country. \u201cBeing a veteran and someone who has been willing to lay down my life for the people of this nation is something that establishes trust and helps folks agree to sit down to have conversations,\u201d Russo said. \u201cFor years I have been in the trenches doing the hard work of actually making changes in our bureaucracy.\u201d Russo has been open in campaign advertisements about a sexual assault committed against her in 2004 by a superior officer. After the Marine Corps declined to press charges, Russo brought the case to the attention of the San Diego district attorney, and eventually the man was discharged and sentenced to three years in prison. \u201cThe story of my assault and how I fought and broke down the door to change shows my tenacity and willingness to fight for what\u2019s right,\u201d she said. \u201cThe status quo is no longer acceptable.\u201d As with many Democratic candidates across the U.S., Russo said she sees health care as a human right and believes there should be a public option for Americans. With the pandemic still in full swing and many businesses and localities struggling financially, Russo said ensuring economic recovery is a key issue. \u201cWe have to take the lessons from 2008 and make sure we\u2019re bailing out Main Street, not Wall Street, and we should be using this time to expand unemployment benefits, paid leave and preparing ourselves to weather a crisis like this in the future,\u201d she said. Russo said she supports demilitarizing the police, whose equipment and demeanor, she said, does not encourage healthy conversation. Citing her experience leading Marines in Afghanistan and Iraq, Russo said she would direct those under her command to remove their helmets and don scarves when talking to locals in an effort to deescalate and build trust. \u201cWe were tasked with winning hearts and minds,\u201d Russo said. \u201cPolice can\u2019t be meeting protesters with tear gas and batons and expect them to talk with them.\u201d Dr. Cameron Webb As the director of health policy and equity at the University of Virginia, Webb said he has been particularly busy over the last few months. Webb said his work involves overseeing a research lab that examines access to health care, including how Medicaid functions, though the pandemic has affected that work. In addition to campaigning and holding regular digital town halls, the physician has been assisting with COVID-19 care, which he said has given him new insight into systemic issues. Webb\u2019s more recent efforts have been to increase testing in communities of color. \u201cThere are a number of inequities in health care and there have been more COVID-19 cases in Latinx communities and more deaths in black communities,\u201d he said. \u201cBy expanding accessible and free testing to these communities, hopefully we can help end those trends.\u201d Webb\u2019s campaign also attracted the attention of Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., who recently endorsed him. Webb said he has long been interested in how policy and health care collide, an interest that helped earn him a White House fellowship that spanned the end of Barack Obama\u2019s administration and the beginning of Donald Trump\u2019s tenure. In addition to health care, Webb said the biggest issues facing the 5th District are climate change and social mobility, the latter of which has been exacerbated by the pandemic, he said. \u201cThe disparities we\u2019re seeing in terms of economic mobility are only going to widen as the pandemic affects every aspect of our lives,\u201d he said. \u201cBut another facet is the need to ensure that schools are well resourced; if all children aren\u2019t getting access to a high-quality education, then these disparities will further widen.\u201d The current civil unrest prompted by the deaths of several black Americans at the hands of police is not solely a police issue, Webb said. \u201cI think the circumstances that we\u2019ve seen have made it abundantly clear that we need reform,\u201d he said. \u201cFrankly, we need reform throughout \u2014 sentencing, corrections, adjudication, reentry \u2014 in all those areas, there are racial disparities.\u201d Webb said he is uniquely qualified to represent the district given the intersection of racial and health inequalities facing the nation right now. \u201cI\u2019m able to speak on issues of racial injustice and health care in a way that is meaningful and substantive,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m a healer by vocation, and healing is precisely what we need right now.\u201d","126":"Students, faculty and staff will return to Grounds this fall, but life in and out of University of Virginia classrooms is going to be very different with virtual classes, social distancing, restroom assignments and daily symptom checks as the school responds to the COVID-19 pandemic. In a Wednesday letter to the university community signed by UVa President Jim Ryan and other school leaders, officials said they plan to start fall classes on Aug. 25, \u201cassuming federal and state guidelines allow it.\u201d Research laboratories are cranking back up and professional schools at the university have begun welcoming students back this summer, officials said. First-year students and others living in university housing will move in on a staggered schedule over several days, but the school will make allowances for students who prefer to learn from home. Practicums and courses that require a student to attend in person to receive a license will still require students to attend in person. \u201cWe have designed this fall so that students can take courses from wherever they are,\u201d the letter states. \u201cRegardless of where students are, our aim will be to provide all of them an engaging and enriching academic experience.\u201d Besides Ryan, the letter was signed by Provost Liz Magill; K. Craig Kent, executive vice president for health affairs; and J.J. Davis, executive vice president and chief operating officer. According to the letter, the need to limit the spread of the coronavirus will result in smaller class sizes. Lectures and classes that normally have a large student audience will be moved online, officials said. In-person classes also will be offered online for those students who choose to stay away from Grounds. \u201cDecisions about which classes will have an in-person option will be made based on the format of each class, our classroom capacity in light of public health requirements, and the availability of faculty instructors to teach in person,\u201d the letter states. \u201cStudents can expect to hear more from individual schools in the coming weeks and no later than the end of July, which is before the start of the add-drop period.\u201d The university also is allowing students to take a course during the January semester \u2014 from Jan. 4 to Jan. 15 \u2014 and during the 2021 summer term without paying additional tuition. \u201cTaking five classes online at one time could be rough and the limited in-person class sizes could lead to situations where students need to take a course during those terms to keep current,\u201d said Brian Coy, UVa spokesman. \u201cThe idea is to provide students with as much flexibility as possible during this time.\u201d \u201cMost students will therefore have the option, depending on their degree program requirements, to spread out what would normally be taken in fall and spring over fall, J-term, spring, and summer,\u201d officials said in the letter. Students who opt to move onto Grounds for the school year can expect to keep their distance and wear masks, according to the letter. \u201cAnyone sharing a classroom, lab, dining hall, lounge, or other common space will need to maintain a six-foot distance for any contact longer than 10 minutes,\u201d officials wrote. \u201cFace coverings will also be required in common spaces and physical barriers will be provided in libraries and in public-service locations like dining hall cashier stations and help desks.\u201d The school will provide students, faculty and staff with personal protective equipment, including masks, officials said. Students, faculty and staff will be required to track their symptoms daily using a cellphone application; tests for the virus will be given to anyone who exhibits symptoms; and voluntary testing will be made available for faculty, staff, contract employees and students who are concerned they may have COVID-19 but do not show symptoms. Students who test positive for the virus may isolate on Grounds and students exposed to the virus may quarantine on Grounds. Students also will discover some differences in university life, from changes to the academic calendar to where they shower. There will be no fall break for 2020 and in-person instruction will end by Thanksgiving with students not returning to Grounds until after Jan. 1, \u201cto minimize travel and possible transmission of the virus.\u201d Students living in dormitories will be able to choose roommates and will be in double rooms. Specific sinks, stalls and showers will be assigned to students, and there will be a limit on the number of students allowed in a communal bathroom at one time. In-person dining on Grounds will have social distance restrictions in place and more take-out options, with many activities being held online rather than in person and those in-person events keeping within public health guidelines, official said. \u201cWe are also developing additional guidelines, including around limiting travel to and from Grounds,\u201d the letter states. \u201cThose decisions are being made now, and we will share more information once we have it.\u201d As university life changes for students, so shall it change for staff. \u201cJust as we know that some students will not return to Grounds this fall, we know that even with the extensive precautions \u2026 not all faculty, staff, and graduate teaching assistants will be in a position to resume in-person work and teaching,\u201d the letter states. \u201cWe are mindful that individual circumstances make some individuals more vulnerable than others to the effects of this disease,\u201d officials wrote. \u201cWe will prioritize requests for modifications from those who are at higher risk for severe illness, as well as anyone with a household member at higher risk.\u201d Athletics will continue during the fall term but exactly what that will look like, and how many spectators may be allowed, is unknown, official said. \u201cWe have not yet made final decisions about fan attendance, but we will communicate plans to our ticket holders and supporters as those decisions are made,\u201d the letter states. \u201cThe steps above are designed to keep students safe, protect all faculty and staff, and prevent the spread of the virus in the broader Charlottesville community. In this case, the actions of even one person can affect many others. Keeping people healthy \u2014 and keeping students on Grounds \u2014 will require all of us to do our part.\u201d UVa officials noted that change is the only constant with COVID-19 and that plans they are putting in place could be altered as medical research into the virus continues and recommendations from health officials change. \u201cAll of this will make life and this semester more difficult, but our hope and expectation is that we can come together in these extraordinary times and make the best of an incredibly difficult situation,\u201d the letter states. \u201cDoing that will require flexibility and patience, but if the past is any indication, this year will also push us to be more creative, inspire us to be more selfless, and in many ways bring us closer together than ever before.\u201d","127":"This story has been updated. Eric Nagy was expecting the call; when it came, he and his wife drove to the Our Lady of Peace retirement community, and staff helped them suit up in protective gear. They walked down the hall of the nursing center, where Eric\u2019s father, Paul Nagy, was isolated in his room. \u201cHe was really weak, but he was still there enough to get everyone on the phone,\u201d Eric said. \u201cI\u2019m really grateful they let us in when they did.\u201d Paul Nagy died two days later on May 3 of the novel coronavirus. He was 83 years old, a former chemist who helped to develop the groundbreaking SX-70 instant camera for Polaroid and a lifelong musician. He didn\u2019t enjoy performing for others, but loved laboring for hours over difficult pieces.  \u201cHe would really work himself up into a sweat over hard music \u2014 that was his true love,\u201d his oldest son said. Paul Nagy was the son of professional musicians who kept a half-dozen pianos in their Boston home. Everyone learned to play, and as an adult, he and his sister would often listen to performances over the phone together. Later that month, on May 30, the Thomas Jefferson Health District marked more than 500 confirmed cases of COVID-19 since the first local case was reported March 16. That same week, the district marked a total of 19 known fatalities from the disease \u2014 a number that has held steady even as case counts rise in June. Officials warn, though, that as the state reopens and medical examiners process death reports, the numbers of confirmed cases and deaths are likely to increase. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ll be out of the woods until there\u2019s a vaccine,\u201d said Ryan McKay, a senior policy analyst with the health district. A majority of outbreaks in Virginia have happened in long-term care facilities, and on Friday, Gov. Ralph Northam unveiled a plan to use federal funding to help nursing homes and other facilities to safely reopen. The Virginia Department of Health also on Friday released a database of outbreaks at specific facilities, something officials had long resisted doing. The data does not match information collected by the Centers of Medicare and Medicaid Services, which the department attributed to differences in how and when data was collected. The VDH database details five outbreaks at long-term care facilities in the Thomas Jefferson Health District. Case counts can include both residents and staff. The database lists an outbreak in progress at Albemarle\u2019s Westminster Canterbury of the Blue Ridge, with an unidentified number of cases, and an outbreak pending closure at Our Lady of Peace, with 56 total cases and five deaths. On Saturday, Westminster Canterbury of the Blue Ridge released a statement to media disputing the state\u2019s description of an outbreak at the facility. A spokeswoman said that all staff and residents tested through point prevalence and other testing have so far had negative results, though some results are still pending. When asked how the pandemic has affected the facility and to confirm the number of cases at the facility, executive director Sara Warden said in a statement that Our Lady of Peace \u201cenacted comprehensive infection control measures in accordance with the Centers for Disease Control and Virginia Department of Health guidelines.\u201d \u201cWe express our sorrow for the passing of residents due to this global pandemic,\u201d Warden wrote in the statement. \u201cFortunately, we have also seen more than 30 residents who have fully recovered and are doing well.\u201d Warden later confirmed that the facility has had 66 total cases among staff and residents. Only one case is active, she said. Fluvanna County\u2019s Envoy at the Village, which also is listed as an outbreak pending closure, has had 53 cases and six deaths, according to the state. Two facilities in Orange County, Dogwood Village of Orange County and the Village at Gordon House, are listed as outbreaks in progress, with five identified cases associated and no deaths reported. Paul Nagy moved into Our Lady of Peace in 2016, after coming to Charlottesville to be near family. He suffered from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and in the past six months, that and other conditions had worsened, until he was moved into Our Lady of Peace\u2019s nursing unit, which offers more intensive care, in April. By that time, the nursing home was on lockdown, and Eric struggled to stay in touch with his father, who had a hard time calling frequently or navigating video calls. Even toward the end, though, Nagy remained a scientist, curious about the medicines he was being prescribed; Eric said his father would have liked knowing that among many other treatments being tested nationally for the coronavirus, doctors tried an anti-parasitic drug, ivermectin. Staff went to \u201cheroic efforts\u201d to set up a video call when Nagy entered hospice care, Eric said. They also made sure to coordinate a priest to give last rites; Nagy\u2019s Catholic faith was important to him. Melanie Mason, a social worker with Hospice of the Piedmont, remembers that effort clearly. Nagy was the first COVID-19 positive case she handled. The facility had largely restricted hospice staff from entering, and so in order to get a spare iPhone into the building for the Nagys to FaceTime to their dad, hospice staff hatched a handoff. An employee left the phone on a bench outside of the building and waited for a nursing home staff member to take it inside to Nagy\u2019s room. \u201cWe were trying to relieve some of the pressure on staff inside, give peace of mind to the family and help the patient, all while in the midst of a global pandemic,\u201d Mason said. \u201cThe whole way we do hospice has changed.\u201d Nagy\u2019s case, in the chaotic early days as local health care workers tried to devise playbooks for various scenarios, helped hospice staff to make a game plan for future cases, Mason said. A week later, she was fit-tested for an N95 mask, trained on how to don PPE and began taking an iPad into the facility regularly to check on other hospice patients and connect them to their families. She had to carefully plan visits to avoid cross-contaminating positive and negative residents. Mason said not going to work wasn\u2019t an option. \u201cWe\u2019re all going to die; this is just one more cause of death,\u201d she said. \u201cEveryone deserves to die with dignity, and I wouldn\u2019t be doing my job if I picked and choose who to help based on how they\u2019re dying.\u201d Mason also has worked to counsel families through uniquely challenging aspects of grief and help them to find closure. She doesn\u2019t normally help with death certificates, but Eric Nagy wanted to make sure that COVID-19 was listed as his father\u2019s cause of death and stated in his obituary; though he had other chronic conditions, doctors and family members were sure coronavirus killed Paul Nagy. \u201cHe said, \u2018It gives legitimacy to the chaos of his death,\u2019\u201d Mason recalled. \u201cOn a personal, social, political level, being able to see that confirmation gave him some closure. That\u2019s a statement I keep going back to every day \u2014 how to help families find closure right now.\u201d v v v Another area COVID-19 casualty was Betty Bradshaw, a former Charlottesville City Schools employee who had lived in the area her whole life. \u201cI\u2019m still riddled with guilt,\u201d said one of her sons, Keith Bradshaw. Betty Bradshaw was an antique car collector who was active with the Piedmont Region of the Antique Automobile Club of America. She went back to work when Keith was in middle school, and was always a steadying presence, he said. \u201cIt was always wonderful to have her there because she got me out of trouble,\u201d he said. She loved knickknacks of all kinds; one of her favorite possessions was a bread baking bowl her grandmother had used. When she moved to Our Lady of Peace after the death of her husband, the bowl had a place on her nightstand. Keith and other family members visited her regularly, working to get used to changes in her routine and mood as dementia set in. Since September, Bradshaw had lived in the facility\u2019s memory care ward, and Keith said nurses were alert to her decline in April and early May. She entered hospice May 7. Bradshaw had tested negative once for COVID-19, but on May 9 she tested positive, and on May 11 she died. COVID-19 was listed as her cause of death. Keith, who has asthma, said he decided not to go see her during those final days. \u201cThat\u2019s what mom would have wanted, too \u2014 she wouldn\u2019t have wanted it that way,\u201d he said. Keith has talked with family members of other Our Lady of Peace residents who have had to make tough choices about whether to pull their loved ones out of nursing homes. Bradshaw\u2019s older sister, Martha Shepherd, died at a local assisted living home in March \u2014 she didn\u2019t have the coronavirus, but the family has been unable to gather in person to mark her passing. They hope to have a joint service for the two sisters in the future. \u201cIt\u2019s so bizarre, who survives and who doesn\u2019t,\u201d he said. He said it\u2019s hard, after his family\u2019s loss, to see people out and about in town without masks. And it\u2019s been hard to grieve, too, not only because of the limited funeral options, but because the pandemic has complicated other aspects of his life, from his work to his daughter\u2019s senior year of high school. Hospice workers have pushed to find ways for people to grieve with others, even though many of the things they typically counsel people to do \u2014 go to church, spend time with friends \u2014 aren\u2019t possible right now. \u201cGrieving already tends to be an isolating experience, and this environment tends to make that even more isolating,\u201d said Teresa Haase, director of bereavement and supportive care services with Hospice of the Piedmont. Hospice workers are using technology to counsel family members and set them up with support groups, she said; the hospice now has private Zoom calls for spouses, children and parents to talk together. Those who have lost loved ones to COVID-19 can feel a different level of heartache, Haase said, because of doubts about whether care was handled appropriately or guilt about not seeing them often enough before death. People aren\u2019t sure how long the pandemic will force them to grieve this way, or where to find hope, she said. \u201cI really believe in resilience, and we\u2019re really relying on it right now in lots of ways,\u201d she said. Mason said that in recent weeks, as the local situation has leveled out, staff and residents in nursing homes seem more cheerful and hopeful. \u201cNow that we\u2019ve been through this initial jolt, we can take a step back and assess,\u201d she said. v v v \u201cWith the caveat that deaths can be a lagging indicator, my understanding is that we\u2019re pretty low in fatalities compared to other parts of the state and country,\u201d said McKay, with the Thomas Jefferson Health Department. He said that after an initial wave of deaths from very sick and high-risk patients, he believed the health care system caught up to treat the virus much earlier; local cases now appear to be less serious. Data from the University of Virginia Medical Center appears to bear that out, according to spokesman Eric Swensen. Case mix index, which refers to how sick a specific group of patients is, has been declining for COVID-19 patients, Swensen said. COVID-19 patients appeared to be at the sickest levels the week of May 4, after a high number of patients from hospitals with maxed-out ICUs were transferred to UVa. Still, the statewide picture remains grim compared with a typical summer. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, since April, Virginia has seen death rates from all causes exceeding normal levels; the excess rate of 13% to 25% in recent weeks can be attributed to the pandemic, according to officials. Locally, one point of disparity remains the racial makeup of cases, hospitalizations and deaths. Black residents make up 18% of confirmed cases, but 48% of hospitalizations and 22% of local deaths, according to the district. Officials have pointed to disparities in access to medical care as likely causes and, as part of a broader effort to enact racial equity in public health and address those disparities, Director Dr. Denise Bonds said in a statement Thursday that the district plans to hire a consultant to review internal policies. Increased testing has made it easier to spot emerging incidents at long-term care facilities and other communal settings, officials say, and the health district has worked to educate heath care workers about precautions and equipment. A big effort by the Albemarle County Fire Rescue Squad also helped fit-test area workers for N95 masks, McKay said, which increased staff confidence about working. But all of that work is now in the past: Health care professionals are acutely aware that the situation could shift at any point, especially as Virginia reopens. Fall school schedules and university classes likely also will present new populations and vectors for infection, experts say \u2014 making it more important than ever to maintain social distancing guidelines until an effective vaccine is created. \u201cIf individuals and the community stop adhering to mitigation efforts, things that each individual person can do on their own, that would put us at risk of increasing local cases,\u201d McKay said.","128":"The University of Virginia currently plans to participate in interscholastic athletics this coming season, school President Jim Ryan said in a news release circulated last week. \u201cThe University expects fall sports to take place and student athletes will hear from coaches about steps to allow them to train safely and compete safely,\u201d it read. \u201cDecisions about fan attendance have not yet been reached but will be announced when complete.\u201d Also yet to be determined is when Virginia\u2019s players will be returning. Most ACC schools have already begun bringing back its football players for voluntary individual workouts. The Cavaliers, along with Duke and Boston College, are the last of the league\u2019s members to announce when football players will return. Meanwhile, the NCAA continues to make plans to get college athletics back in action. The NCAA last week approved plans for an extended preseason to give teams more time to hold walk-throughs. With the coronavirus pandemic wiping out spring practice for most teams, along with the usual required summer activities for players such as weight training and film study, schools want to make up for lost preparation time. However, there continues to be evidence of potential pitfalls. The University of Texas announced on June 17 that 13 football players tested positive for COVID-19 or are presumed positive, and contact tracing has 10 more in isolation. Texas started bringing football players back to campus for workouts on June 8. The school has also identified four other players who tested positive for the COVID-19 antibody. Kansas State officials reported on June 18 that eight Wildcats athletes have tested positive for COVID-19 out of 130 tested. Michigan State\u2019s athletic department says it conducted COVID-19 testing on 124 athletes on June 15, and one tested positive and will be isolated for 10 to 14 days. Michigan also disclosed testing results. Sami Rifat, a physician with the athletic department, says the school has had two positive tests on athletes, out of 221 tests.","129":"The Albemarle County Board of Supervisors likely will be among the first Central Virginia officials to publicly discuss removing a Confederate monument under a new law as the Charlottesville City Council continues to face hurdles. According to the Board\u2019s July 1 agenda, Civil War monuments and memorials will be discussed. The meeting is the same day that a new law goes into effect, allowing localities the authority to remove, relocate or alter their war monuments after following a public process. A \u201cJohnny Reb\u201d statue has sat in front of the Albemarle County courthouse since 1909. The law requires localities to first publish a notice of intent in a newspaper, followed by a public hearing within 30 days, which county spokesperson Emily Kilroy has said could run in The Daily Progress as early as July 7, with a special meeting to follow in August. After holding a special hearing, a locality must offer the monument or memorial for relocation and placement to any museum, historical society, government or military battlefield, and must wait 30 days before removal. The language of the law gives the locality \u201csole authority to determine the final disposition of the monument or memorial,\u201d indicating that the locality can grant possession of a statue to a private entity. If Albemarle sticks to the potential timeline, then the earliest the statue could be removed, relocated recontextualized or covered would be Sept. 5. Remaining legal complications will likely extend the process for removing Charlottesville\u2019s monuments, should the city try to do so again. The winners of a lawsuit that found the Charlottesville City Council violated state code in a vote to remove a Confederate statue in 2017 recently ceded to the new law. No hearing or further motions have been filed since the Monument Fund filed to partially dissolve the permanent injunction barring the statues\u2019 removal, but Charles \u201cBuddy\u201d Weber, a plaintiff and spokesman for the Monument Fund, said the group is not interested in extending the litigation. The motion also indicates that the Monument Fund has received an offer from a \u201cgenerous donor\u201d to relocate the Lee statue and perhaps also the Jackson statue, and several locations are under consideration. In an email, City Councilor Heather Hill affirmed the body\u2019s \u201ccommitment to following the process under the new statute,\u201d but did not clarify whether the city had a potential timeline for removing the Robert E. Lee and Thomas \u201cStonewall\u201d Jackson statues. \u201cThe city council is currently working with its legal counsel to pursue the necessary steps to dissolve the injunction and conduct a public hearing about the removal of the statues pursuant to the recently enacted legislation,\u201d Hill wrote. Elsewhere in town, the fate of other statues remains unclear. In November, the council voted to direct city staff to create a plan for removing a West Main Street statue commemorating the Lewis and Clark expedition. The statue, which depicts explorers Meriwether Lewis, who was born in Albemarle County, and William Clark, accompanied by Lemhi Shoshone interpreter Sacagawea, has received criticism for its depiction of Sacagawea. City spokesman Brian Wheeler said the city had nothing to announce yet in terms of a cost estimate or plan for its removal. The Lewis and Clark Exploratory Center in Albemarle County has expressed interest in having the statue relocated to its facility and recontextualized, according to Alexandria Searls, the center\u2019s executive director. Searls said the center has not had further communication about moving the statute since the fall, but would seek to work with descendants of Sacagawea and other Indigenous individuals and groups to contextualize the statue. \u201cWe are definitely interested in having an American Indian interpretation of the statue,\u201d she said. \u201cPerhaps the statue, portrayed in a more accurate light, could have draw attention to Indigenous causes and get young people interested.\u201d Further down West Main Street, a statue of George Rogers Clark has also attracted calls for removal. Clark, who was born in Albemarle County, was a general who fought Native American tribes as the U.S. expanded westward following the Revolutionary War. The statue calls him the \u201cConqueror of the Northwest.\u201d It sits at the intersection of West Main Street and Jefferson Park Avenue on University of Virginia property. According to UVa spokesman Wes Hester, discussion on what to do with the statue has been referred to the UVa President Jim Ryan\u2019s Commission on the University in the Age of Segregation; the group has been on hold for several months due to the COVID-19 pandemic.","130":"COVID couldn\u2019t, but a conundrum in the regional contest almost did. UVa had won the National Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition for the previous two years running. Team members were looking to defend their title. \u201cThe regionals were challenging; we had issues with our firewall that we were unable to recover from,\u201d team captain Maggie Gates told Raytheon Intelligence & Space, which presents the NCCDC, for an online story. Virginia lost at regionals. However, this year the competition featured a wild-card category, for which UVa was chosen. Moving on to the next level, UVa beat out eight other teams to win the national championship for the third year. Last month\u2019s competition had teams facing a devised scenario in which they had to defend a hypothetical company against a cyberattack. Raytheon explains that the teams not only had to protect the company against attack \u2014 keeping safe its intellectual property, its customers\u2019 personal data and its employees\u2019 personnel records. But they also had to do so while keeping the company\u2019s cyber presence safely up and running \u2014 including email, websites, cloud storage and other functions. The COVID-19 pandemic and the isolation strategies it demanded made that even tougher this year. \u201cUsually, we\u2019re all huddled in a room together, looking over each other\u2019s shoulders, passing notes back and forth, because communication is key in the competition,\u201d Ms. Gates told Raytheon. \u201c\u2026While the virtual aspect was harder, it was made easier since we all trust each other\u2019s skills and abilities, and if one of us says, \u2018I got this,\u2019 then we move onto something else.\u201d \u201cI got this,\u201d indeed. That combination of teamwork and individual initiative resulted in UVa getting something else: the 2020 national championship. Congratulations, cyber superstars!","131":"A new collaboration has been formed between the UVa center and the Central Virginia Small Business Development Center. Called the Propel Management Consulting Program, it assigns students to help businesses transition more of their activities online. On both sides of the equation, the collaboration was propelled by COVID-19. Students lost internships because studies were shifted online and businesses closed to the public. Businesses that had to close to the public needed to compensate by moving more of their activities online. Result: Students could gain real-world experience by helping businesses do exactly that; they essentially become interns for the CVSBDC. The new director there, Rebecca Haydock, says their help will greatly improve her agency\u2019s response to growing demands created by the coronavirus pandemic. The program targets Fluvanna, Louisa, Orange and Greene counties. This is a smart response to one of the many problems imposed by the pandemic. Instead of two groups struggling alone to confront separate versions of that problem, we now have those two groups meeting each other\u2019s needs \u2014 and their own as well. Kudos to the CVSBDC and the UVa Career Center for a creative solution.","132":"Each year since 2013, Carrie Heilman, a professor in the University of Virginia\u2019s McIntire School of Commerce, asks students in her yearlong Promotions course to participate in a national competition of the American Advertising Federation. And, recently, a team of McIntire students won the competition, even amidst challenges brought on by the coronavirus pandemic. The National Student Advertising Competition is \u201cthe premier college advertising competition that provides more than 2,000 college students the real-world experience of creating a strategic advertising\/marketing\/media campaign for a corporate client.\u201d This year\u2019s advertising client was Adobe and, unlike previous years of presenting an advertising campaign directed to consumers, Adobe asked the student teams to pitch a campaign to raise awareness, generate site visits, garner earned media and create sales leads for its ad tech software bundle, Experience Cloud for Advertising, a product aimed at advertisers. A business-to-business presentation would require focusing on a different audience: executives and decision-makers versus direct consumers. The strategy put together by Heilman\u2019s students included reaching out to the McIntire alumni network for interviews in the ad tech community, an extensive social media analysis, and focus groups. In the midst of preparing the presentation, the COVID19 pandemic shut down in-person classes nationwide and converted the 2020 competition into a virtual event. Student team members had to change the way they collaborated, and Zoom meetings became the new means of communication. The virtual competition also added the challenge of producing a video presentation instead of the traditional face-to-face pitch. That video presentation, \u201cGet Noticed,\u201d propelled the McIntire team through the district and semifinal rounds of competition and placed them in first place over eight other schools and garnered a cash prize and trophy. The suggested strategy would position Adobe\u2019s data-driven product to grab the attention of those decision makers accustomed to ignoring advertising. Heilman\u2019s team also received the MRI-Simmons Inspired by Insight Award, given to the school with the best application of research demonstrated in its presentation and pitch book. This is the fourth national win secured by the McIntire School since it began competing in the early 1980s. Carl Zeithaml, dean of the school, said, \u201cFor decades, the Promotions experience at McIntire involved countless hours of very intense, face-to-face collaboration and interaction. This year, while the students, faculty and staff were dealing with the pandemic and the transition to online teaching and learning, Carrie, her support team and the students found creative ways to effectively translate those interactions into a rigorous and productive remote, distributed experience that resulted in a national championship. It was truly an extraordinary performance.\u201d","133":"RICHMOND \u2014 More than 1,500 of Virginia\u2019s 29,000 prison inmates have been infected with COVID-19, but officials say roughly nine out of ten had no symptoms and almost all are now believed virus free. The Virginia Department of Corrections had tested 22,538 inmates for the virus as of Tuesday as part of a large-scale \u201cpoint prevalence\u201d testing program. The results show that while it has infected about 5% of the prison population, the coronavirus has thus far not led to widespread serious illness as had been feared. As of Wednesday, 11 inmates had died and six remain hospitalized for COVID-19, but only 74 were known to still have the virus and most of them have no symptoms. Sixty-eight prison employees currently have the virus. No staff deaths have been reported. Seventy-four cases may be a lot, said Trey Fuller, assistant director of health services for the department, \u201cbut if the community had the same level of testing it would show that we are really stopping and slowing the spread quite a bit.\u201d Test results do not lead to treatment \u2014 there is none \u2014 but allows for a housing strategy to curb the spread, said Fuller. \u201cI would say there has been much less widespread transmission [here] than in other correctional systems because of our strategy,\u201d he said. Point prevalence testing is the testing of everyone \u2014 with or without symptoms \u2014 in a given congregate setting, such as a prison or nursing home, at a given time. It gives a snapshot of the virus\u2019s spread and effects. The department, assisted by the Virginia Department of Health, state hospitals and others, began the effort in April. Of those testing positive, 88% had no symptoms, the department reported. Those who test positive are periodically retested until they are negative or cleared by at least 14 days without symptoms following the positive test, said the department. The UCLA Law Covid-19 Behind Bars Data Project has been tracking confirmed cases in prisons across the country. They said roughly a dozen states, like Virginia, have tested significant portions, if not all, of their inmate population. However, they said they do not have a breakdown on how many offenders testing positive in other states showed symptoms and how many did not. Fuller, who helped head up the prison system\u2019s testing program, said he was not surprised by the number of infected inmates without symptoms. \u201cWe are doing so much point prevalence surveillance \u2014 which is really just not occurring in the community or any other setting, except for maybe long-term care facilities,\u201d said Fuller. He said the asymptomatic results were seen early on, starting at a small, 70-offender work camp where 84% tested positive and none showed symptoms. Several who had symptoms that prompted testing there had already been moved and quarantined. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen how rapidly it spreads and how it oftentimes doesn\u2019t cause any symptoms,\u201d he said of the virus. \u201cI think it\u2019s probably happening in the community as well, but the testing is just not nearly as widespread,\u201d Fuller said. Dr. Leana Wen, a public health professor at George Washington University, said the prison testing results illustrate the need for more public testing. \u201cCongregate settings such as nursing homes and prisons are extremely high-risk settings for COVID-19,\u201d said Wen, who is also an emergency physician and former health commissioner for Baltimore. \u201cIt\u2019s critical that surveillance is done in these congregate settings . . . that\u2019s because where there\u2019s one case that\u2019s detected, often that is the canary in the coal mine.\u201d The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said that as of last week there were 2.6 million reported cases in the U.S., but that there are likely 10 times as many people who have been infected by the virus. \u201cAsymptomatic transmission is one of the reasons why this virus is so difficult to contain,\u201d Wen said. Fuller said that \u201cvery quickly we found out that once the virus was there, especially if the virus had been there for days or a week or two, that the spreads were very rapidly.\u201d He said that typically, point prevalence testing is not done unless there is a treatment available, which there is not for COVID-19. However, Fuller said the testing has enabled the department to keep those who test positive with no symptoms living in one place and those who test negative in another. Those who are ill are quarantined. \u201cWe created not a treatment strategy, but a housing strategy to really try slow the spread \u2014 stop the spread if possible \u2014 of the virus,\u201d said Fuller. The ongoing testing has been done with the help of the Virginia Department of Health, specialists at the VCU and UVA hospitals and the National Guard. Both public and private laboratories have been used for the testing. Fuller said the program began before guidance on point prevalence came out from the CDC or VDH. \u201cWe saw its utility and moved forward with it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a two-pronged approach: the National Guard is going across the state and testing nursing homes and prisons as well as, clinically, if there is a need for point prevalence due to positive staff or positive offenders we will also do point prevalence on our own,\u201d said Fuller. He said there have been offenders who have tested positive for extended periods of time but that he was not aware of any who were reinfected. Early on in the epidemic, other facilities with closed environments, such as nursing homes, were experiencing serious, deadly outbreaks in Virginia and across the country. Advocacy groups here and across the country warned of a looming medical crisis behind bars where maintaining social distancing, inadequate protective equipment and other issues could lead to many deaths and the spreading of the virus in communities where the prisons are located.","134":"But intent does not necessarily align with impact, and the impact here is devastating both for affected individuals and for the health-care system at the University of Virginia and beyond. This is only the most recent in series of restrictions that have made it harder for foreign-born physicians to work in America. Although these rulings attempt to exempt health-care providers, in practice this has not been the case, and UVa physicians are seeing their careers derailed and families torn apart. Immigrants are indispensable to our health-care workforce. This is evident in the make-up of our resident physicians, the newly minted doctors who help run academic medical centers like ours.\u00a0 Of the 37,256 physicians slated to begin their residency training this summer, 4,222 were born outside of the United States. In our field, pathology \u2014 which encompasses the study and diagnosis of disease \u2014 immigrant physicians comprise 33.8 % of incoming trainees nationwide. To be clear: There is no queue of qualified, unemployed Americans ready and eager to do this work. These are positions that, if not available to our highly qualified foreign-born candidates, would go unfilled.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 From biopsies to blood tests, pathology results are critical for patient care. Institutions like ours are fortunate to have immigrant health-care providers willing to share their expertise to ensure that those results are correct. Many physicians \u2014 including one of the authors \u2014 have had their personal and professional lives torpedoed by this ruling and those that preceded it. But the suffering does not end with us; it extends to our patients, who will not have access to the high-quality diagnostic services if America continues to slam its doors on immigrants. The fallacy and cruelty of draining expertise from the field of medicine centered on laboratory diagnosis \u2014 including COVID-19 testing \u2014 during a pandemic should terrify us as much as it angers us.

Mills, MD Akriti Gupta, MD Albemarle County","135":"He misses friends, but hasn\u2019t really minded being at home, he said \u2014 many of his classes require watching a lot of movies, and he turned that homework into a family affair. He recently watched the Japanese horror film \u201cThe Grudge\u201d with his parents. Chharia actually hopes to stay with them during the upcoming fall semester, too, as he works to finish his undergraduate degree early. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t been that bad, though it\u2019s been hard to go out to shoot,\u201d said Chharia, who is a film student and hopes to go to Los Angeles after graduation. \u201cBut then, when we talk about the fall semester \u2014 I just need to focus on finishing school in a year, so I can move to California.\u201d He\u2019s not expecting to know for sure which of his 18 semester credits will be online until mid-July, he said, at which point he\u2019ll need to decide whether he can spend the semester at home or in Charlottesville. At this point, UVa does not have a firm estimate of how many students will be on Grounds this fall, spokesman Brian Coy said, and officials expect numbers to fluctuate until the first week of August, when students finish course registration and see which courses will be online or in-person. According to UVa\u2019s current reopening plan, students should have the option to stay home and participate remotely, defer admission or take a gap year. Larger classes will remain online, and the university has said that faculty with health concerns also will be able to keep classes online. UVa has added a face mask policy to its handbook; ordered hand sanitizer and face masks; and is working to clarify how testing, contact tracing and quarantine will work among the student body and broader community. Still, students \u2014 and a chorus of university staff and faculty informally surveyed online \u2014 aren\u2019t quite sure how it will all work out. And students drive a portion of university revenue \u2014 according to a UVa Health System presentation reviewed by The Daily Progress, a 10% decline in in-state and out-of-state students not enrolling in Virginia colleges this fall could cause a $526 million hit. If Chharia does need to return to Charlottesville, he said he\u2019s nervous about the university\u2019s ability to enforce social distancing guidelines at off-Grounds gatherings. \u201cI know people at other schools who are not taking it very seriously,\u201d he said. \u201cBut then, how do you handle parties and social gatherings from a school standpoint? I don\u2019t know what to expect, but more communication and more enforcement would be nice.\u201d v v v A key part of UVa\u2019s reopening plan will be the ability to quickly identify, test, treat and isolate people who become COVID-19 positive. Dr. Mitchell Rosner, chairman of UVa\u2019s Department of Medicine and a lead on the team working to organize UVa\u2019s student COVID-19 testing plan, said last week that the university is still at least two weeks out from releasing its fall testing plan, but that it hopes to do some combination of symptomatic testing \u2014 when someone gets sick \u2014 and point-prevalence testing \u2014 checking groups of people at a specific point in time, such as residents of a dorm floor or the returning third-year class. A preference would be to test everyone returning to Grounds in August, plus every person who displays symptoms throughout the semester, but the eventual plan will depend on resources and money, Rosner said. \u201cReally, we need to make sure that a plan for symptomatic people is in place first,\u201d he said. Currently, the university plans to use its standard PCR test, which it has been able to use and validate repeatedly, though supply chain issues still exist. If an effective saliva or antigen test comes online in time for August, the university might supplement with those formats, Rosner said. Rosner wouldn\u2019t say just how many tests the university is planning to do over the course of the fall \u2014 but that officials know they might need a lot. \u201cWe\u2019re prepared to do a lot of tests if we have to, but it\u2019s going to be dependent on circumstances,\u201d he said. \u201cThe key thing is going to be for us to really behave like a community that cares about each other \u2014 and, to me, that means wearing a mask when you\u2019re out in public, keeping your distance.\u201d \u201cWhen those things break down, outbreaks occur,\u201d he said, referring to proven public health and social distancing recommendations. According to a joint letter sent in June to state officials, one avenue to reopen UVa, Virginia Commonwealth University and Virginia Tech could require 20 weeks of testing during both the fall and spring semesters, with special emphasis on the start of the semesters. During those beginning weeks, campuses around the state could need to administer 19,700 tests per day; Virginia currently averages about 10,000 per day. According to material reviewed by The Progress, UVa hopes to be able to conduct 1,700 tests per day by mid-summer. Welcoming students and faculty back to college this fall represents \u201cone of the most challenging examples of resumption of normal activities,\u201d Dr. K. Craig Kent, UVa\u2019s executive vice president for health affairs, wrote state Health and Human Services Secretary Daniel Carey on June 17. The letters don\u2019t really represent an actual plan, Coy said, but offer a benchmark for the costs that various measures might incur. The UVa academic division received an allocation of $10.1 million from the state, originating from the federal CARES Act Coronavirus Relief Fund. The money will be for personal protective equipment and other expenses related to the coronavirus, according to Coy. From the same CRF money, the UVa Medical Center received $16.3 million, part of which went toward the spring expansion in testing, but would not cover a broad, campus-wide testing system \u2014 such a program remains unfunded right now, according to the university. Rosner said he knows there is some inherent risk to a large public health effort that relies in part on college-age people following rules. \u201cBut, personally, if I didn\u2019t have some confidence that we can bring students back and have school, I wouldn\u2019t be doing this,\u201d he said. v v v Sarah Marks, who grew up in rural Prince George County, said UVa\u2019s location, culture and challenging academics appealed to her when she began considering colleges. She still is looking forward to starting her first year of college on the pre-med track this fall \u2014 though she\u2019s nervous about what that might look like during COVID-19. \u201cI started thinking about how college might turn out when our senior graduation got canceled in March,\u201d she said. She already had signed a housing contract to live on Grounds, \u201cbut I\u2019ve been having a lot of second thoughts about it.\u201d Marks said that after the initial flood of information about cancellations and changes, she\u2019s waiting to see how the semester might turn out for her personally: Will she be able to get tested? Will any of her classes be in person? How will she meet people and make friends? \u201cIf all of my classes will be online anyways, I should just stay home, but I do think being on Grounds will be part of the experience,\u201d she said. \u201cNo one really knows.\u201d Still, she said, she doesn\u2019t want to defer a year or go to a community college instead. She\u2019s committed, for now, to spending four years at UVa \u2014 though she does hope that if the university transitions fully online again, she gets a rebate on tuition. \u201cI can understand they\u2019re really in an uncertain time and they\u2019re trying to take precautions,\u201d she said. If she gets sick on Grounds, though, Marks said she\u2019s already decided to fight COVID in Charlotesville, rather than go back to her parents\u2019 house. \u201cI told them, if I get sick, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll come home,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s too risky. It\u2019s just how it is right now.\u201d","136":"Stacey Washington took a chance on the Fourth of July weekend. Yes, the coronavirus pandemic was still limiting everyday life, but her birthday was July 6 and so, she thought, it would be fine to go without a face mask for a celebration in the backyard, right? \u201cBoy, was I wrong,\u201d she said. \u201cA couple of days later I woke up out of my sleep and I could not breathe.\u201d Washington\u2019s spouse had to catch her before she collapsed from breathing difficulties. Sure enough, she tested positive for the virus. \u201cI took it for a joke, I really did, and I\u2019m regretting it every day, every moment that I\u2019ve been sitting in this room ...,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s just not worth it.\u201d Washington shared her story in a virtual press conference Monday held by Charlottesville Mayor Nikuyah Walker. The event focused on the ongoing pandemic and safety measures local residents should take to limit the spread of the virus. \u201cIt\u2019s very, very, very, very serious,\u201d Washington said. \u201cThis community isn\u2019t taking it seriously.\u201d Walker said the city has received reports about gatherings with \u201chundreds of people.\u201d Walker and City Manager Tarron Richardson said city leaders are in discussion with Albemarle County officials about requesting that Gov. Ralph Northam allow the area to return to Phase Two of the state\u2019s reopening guidelines. \u201cWe are very concerned about the numbers spiking in our area,\u201d Walker said. The Thomas Jefferson Health District, which includes the city and county, reported 1,236 cases of the coronavirus and 29 deaths as of Monday. In the first 13 days of July, the district saw 308 new cases, putting the month on pace to surpass June\u2019s 380 cases. Nationally, cases continue to skyrocket as states plough forward with eased restrictions. The U.S. has seen more than 3.3 million cases of the virus, and more than 136,000 people have died. TJHD Director Dr. Denise Bonds said that 7% to 8% of people who are tested for the virus are positive locally. The rate of positive local tests was as low as 4.6% a month ago. Taking a step back in reopening would help to limit capacity at businesses and gatherings. Walker acknowledged that \u201cthere have been a lot of mixed messages\u201d from the state, federal and local levels about how to limit the spread of the virus. \u201cWe\u2019ve been taking the approach of just getting the message out and having conversations with people to change behaviors instead of very heavy-handed enforcement,\u201d she said. \u201cIf we were getting a clearer message out to the public, we would be more comfortable with a more firm response.\u201d Safety measures have become a political football, particularly recommendations to wear a face mask; President Donald Trump only recently appeared at an event with a mask for the first time. Some people choose not to wear one and say it restricts their breathing, while others wear one but don\u2019t fully cover their mouth and nose or they frequently remove the mask. \u201cWhen you go outside, you say, \u2018I can\u2019t breathe with this mask on, I\u2019m going to take it off,\u2019\u201d Washington said. \u201cTry breathing with COVID.\u201d Jeanita Richardson, a professor at the University of Virginia\u2019s School of Medicine, said everyone should be wearing a mask, even if it\u2019s not heavy duty, because \u201cwearing one is better than not wearing one.\u201d Charles Alexander, who helped to integrate Charlottesville schools and is known in his youth educational work as Mr. Alex Zan, spoke during the press conference and said there\u2019s one piece of information that is reliable \u2014 everyone is at risk of catching the virus. \u201cCOVID-19 doesn\u2019t care about you,\u201d he said. \u201cCOVID-19 doesn\u2019t care about age, area code or ZIP code.\u201d Richardson said that those who have received a negative test are not safe because they could still contract the virus. Richardson said anyone who has attended large gatherings or any events since mid-June should be tested. \u201cThis is not a drill,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is about saving your life and saving the life of people that you love.\u201d Sentara Martha Jefferson Hospital is offering 250 free tests from 5 to 7 p.m. Thursday at Washington Park in Charlottesville. The hospital will conduct another testing event at the park on July 23. UVa is conducting a testing event at Buford Middle School in the city from 2 to 4 p.m. Saturday. Washington said that her body aches from the virus and she cannot sleep. She has isolated herself in a bedroom and can\u2019t spend any time around her 11-year-old son. \u201cFor those couple of hours I took my mask off, I said I\u2019m alright, and I really wasn\u2019t,\u201d she said. \u201cI just want everyone to know that it can happen, and it can happen to you. It can happen to any of us.\u201d","137":null,"138":"After hundreds of division employees signed an open letter calling for a virtual return to school, Albemarle County schools Superintendent Matt Haas said he\u2019ll present an online-only option for the School Board to consider at the end of this month. \u201c[The letter] tells me that there is a real fear that our employees are feeling about returning to school in the fall,\u201d Haas said Tuesday. The letter, written by two Albemarle County teachers, followed the release of the division\u2019s reopening plans and is similar to efforts from from Charlottesville teachers and teacher associations throughout the state who have sought to persuade superintendents and School Boards to opt for all virtual classes. Teachers locally and across the country have said they are terrified to return to work and are concerned about the quality of in-person classes that abide by social distancing and other measures to slow or prevent the spread of the coronavirus. By Tuesday afternoon, more than 500 staff members \u2014 20% of the division\u2019s workforce \u2014 signed the letter, which included eight pages of questions for division leadership. Those unanswered questions factored into the call for online-only classes. \u201c... All of the facilities questions, the instructional questions, the health questions that go along with that are just highlighting a level of uncertainty that I think most of the people who have signed that letter are just not comfortable with in terms of returning to work,\u201d said Vicki Hobson, an Albemarle County instructional coach who helped to write the letter, adding the list is just the tip of the iceberg of what staff want to know. Hobson and Katherine Gerry, a teacher at Broadus Wood Elementary, helped to write the letter and worked with other teachers to edit the document and compile the questions. Haas outlined a reopening plan last Thursday that would send elementary students to classes four days a week while middle and high school students could go to school one or two days a week, a plan similar to what was proposed in Charlottesville City Schools. Parents also can choose an all-online option. Haas said Friday that the plan would keep students and staff safe. In recent days, school systems including Arlington Public Schools have reconsidered sending students back to face-to-face classes as positive cases of COVID-19 continue to climb. The city school system provided information Monday night about the pros and cons of online-only classes and is surveying families and school staff about the different options. Haas said in an update to employees Tuesday that recent health developments in the region are making offering in-person classes \u201ca more difficult path forward every day.\u201d \u201cWe are not yet at the point where we can open our schools with confidence that our students, their families, and our staff will be safe,\u201d he wrote. \u201cHopefully, these conditions will improve over the next two months or soon thereafter.\u201d On Tuesday, the health district reported an additional 41 cases for a total of 1,277, and the percent of positive cases ticked up to 8%. Albemarle County has the highest case totals in the area with 578. Why all-virtual classes Hobson, who has two young boys, had initially planned to send her kids to school in-person. But she changed her mind after reading research about the virus, seeing families not wearing masks or social distancing and hearing about an Arizona teacher who died after contracting the virus. The teacher had worked in the same classroom as two other educators to run a virtual summer school program. \u201cAnd for me, it just hit home; this isn\u2019t theoretical,\u201d she said. \u201cThe likelihood of somebody that I know might die and do I want that to be my children? Do I want that to be me? Do I want that to be my friends? Do I want that to be anybody in our school system and greater community? \u2026 I have my own children and I cherish them like all parents do, and I just wasn\u2019t willing for them to be guinea pigs.\u201d The University of Virginia\u2019s plans to bring back students to Grounds also led to her change of mind. Hobson called for a virtual return to school at last Thursday\u2019s county School Board meeting and said she received an outpouring of support afterward, which evolved into teaming up with Gerry to write the letter. Hobson said she was overwhelmed by the response. \u201cIt speaks to the fact that we have a whole community of educators that desperately want to do their jobs and do them well and care deeply about families and students, but also care deeply about their health,\u201d she said. \u201c... I\u2019m proud of people for putting themselves out there and putting their names publicly on a letter.\u201d Gerry, who teaches third grade at Broadus Wood, said she felt a responsibility to ask questions about the division\u2019s plan to know that she can keep herself and her students safe. She also was inspired by the Charlottesville teachers who penned their own open letter last week. \u201cWe\u2019re using their lessons as a starting point, which was great,\u201d she said. In the letter, the teachers wrote they are aware of parents\u2019 concerns and of the arguments in favor of face-to-face classes, adding that they recognize the first iteration of virtual learning during the spring didn\u2019t adequately serve all students and families. However, they want to protect the community\u2019s well-being. Monica Laux, a teacher at Albemarle High School, helped with the letter because she\u2019s worried about marginalized communities and fears that in-person classes would put Black and Latinx students more at-risk. Local, state and national data about COVID-19 infections shows that the virus is having a disportationate effect on communities of color. In the Thomas Jefferson Health District, Black people make up nearly half of those who have been hospitalized for the virus while Hispanic people comprise 17%. \u201cMany of our families will have the resources and wealth available to choose online learning or private tutoring while we send our most marginalized communities, families, students, and teachers alike, into unsafe indoor environments,\u201d they wrote in the letter. Laux said the division should evaluate at-risk students\u2019 needs and seek community-centered and safe solutions. Additionally, she doesn\u2019t think benefits of in-person schooling outweigh making virtual instruction robust, collaborative and helpful. \u201cI think that an in person environment where we\u2019re all masked, and teachers are put in a position of policing students, yelling at them to put their mask back on or stay six feet apart is more traumatizing than trying to build an online community and show our support and love for students that way,\u201d she said. Drafting a new plan Haas said Tuesday that division leadership will go back to the drawing board to draft a plan for virtual learning that includes more professional development for staff, a consistent schedule for students and childcare options for employees and parents. The School Board meets July 30 to decide on a reopening plan. Haas said the plan presented last week was created based on what was allowed for Phase Three. Division officials used building and school bus capacity to come up with the scheduling options. Virginia schools can provide in-person classes to all students if the state remains in Phase Three of its reopening plan. Under Phase Two, school divisions are allowed to offer limited in-person classes for students with disabilities, English Language Learners and preschoolers through third-graders. On Monday, Charlottesville officials said they are weighing whether to ask Gov. Ralph Northam to allow the area to return to Phase Two. Haas said that opening schools would expose teachers and support staff to more risk. Haas said another concern with in-person classes is the return of UVa students next month, a worry echoed by city officials and School board members. \u201cYou throw in the other potential for the super-spreaders, which is bringing the students back, even a portion of students back to UVa, I think you\u2019re increasing the chances for spreading [the virus] exponentially and having it get into the schools,\u201d Haas said. Further complicating decisions about reopening is a lack of federal leadership and murky guidance from state officials, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard,\u201d Haas said. \u201c... What I hear from many of my colleagues is that they really would appreciate it if someone at the state level would just make a decision about how schools across the state would be run.\u201d","139":null,"140":"All University of Virginia students will have to submit documentation of a negative COVID-19 test and quarantine for 14 days before returning to Charlottesville for the start of classes next month, the school said Thursday. The mandatory testing is one of several public health measures UVa announced as it seeks to bring students back for fall classes. Charlottesville and Albemarle County officials have criticized the decision to have in-person classes, saying that it puts the wider community at greater risk for exposure to the virus. Last month, the university detailed how it planned to bring students back, which includes having a mix of in-person and online classes. That plan is contingent on state and federal guidelines, as well as the status of the pandemic. UVa is contracting with a vendor, Let\u2019s Get Checked, for the tests, which will be provided at no charge to students who use that vendor, according to the plan. Tests will be mailed to students\u2019 houses and need to be sent to the lab no fewer than seven days before returning to Grounds. Results will be available within 24 to 48 hours after the lab receives the sample. \u201cThe information we share today is comprehensive, but its message is simple: Tackling COVID-19 is a challenge, but we will have a successful return to Grounds if we pull together and take the individual steps necessary to keep ourselves and the people around us safe,\u201d Provost Liz Magill and Chief Operating Officer J.J. Davis said in announcing the plan details. Students on Grounds still will be expected to wear masks, follow guidelines for physical distancing, regularly wash their hands and limit contact with others. Those who test positive will be asked to self-isolate at home for 10 days before they can be cleared to return to Charlottesville. During the school year, anyone with symptoms of COVID-19 will be asked to get tested and self-isolate until the test results are back. Those who don\u2019t have symptoms but want to be tested can do so once every 60 days, or more frequently if prior authorization is obtained from Employee Health or Student Health. If there\u2019s an outbreak of cases in a certain area on Grounds, those who spent time in those areas will be tested. The public health measures primarily concern activity on Grounds; however, students are encouraged to follow all state and federal guidelines to prevent the spread of the virus. Earlier this week, Charlottesville Mayor Nikuyah Walker and other officials voiced concern about large gatherings of students in bars and apartments this past weekend. Allen Groves, dean of students at UVa, condemned the gatherings in an email to students Tuesday. \u201cPlease recommit to observing social distancing and wearing masks when in the company of others with whom you do not share a home,\u201d he wrote. \u201cFailure to do so places the most vulnerable at significant risk and will likely lead to an end to on-Grounds education this fall.\u201d In addition to the negative tests, all students are asked to quarantine for 14 days before returning to Grounds. Those who are unable to self-quarantine should minimize contact with others during this 14-day period, the university said. \u201cSpecifically, the student should not attend any large social events or interact with more than a few people (3-5) at a time,\u201d officials wrote, adding that students should follow physical distancing guidelines and other mitigation strategies such as hand-washing and wearing a mask. International students traveling from abroad are required to self-quarantine for 14 days upon arrival in the United States. The university will not restrict students\u2019 travel after they move back to the Charlottesville area. However, officials recommend that students remain in the area. Students and employees also will be required to complete training about how to mitigate the risk of spreading the virus. \u201cThese steps are crucial to keep members of the UVa community and our Charlottesville neighbors safe, and we ask that all students take responsibility for protecting our numerous faculty, staff, students and neighbors who are at high risk of serious COVID-19 complications,\u201d university officials wrote in the public health measures. UVa classes start Aug. 25, and in-person instruction will end by Thanksgiving. Each employee will receive two cloth face coverings, while students will receive two masks and two 2-ounce containers of hand sanitizer. The university is planning to place 2,600 hand-sanitizer stands in high-trafficked areas and implement enhanced cleaning protocols. Before and after classes, faculty and students will be required to wipe down podiums, surfaces, desks, chairs and tables with disinfecting supplies provided in the rooms. Students, faculty and staff planning to be on Grounds will have to complete a daily health check of symptoms related to COVID-19 through a phone app or by email.","141":"The free summer program from the Curry School of Education and Human Development was part of an initiative from the Children\u2019s Defense Fund, which created the model for Freedom Schools that includes culturally responsive teaching materials. UVa\u2019s program is the third such school in Virginia and one of 181 nationwide, according to the defense fund. The last week of the Freedom School gave students a chance to show off posters made for the Children\u2019s Defense Fund National Day of Social Action. The posters, displayed at their homes, focused on what the students think is important. Many talked about Black Lives Matter, encouraging adults to vote for Black rights. Other posters asked adults to vote for COVID to go away and others supported votes in favor of animal rights and cartoons. \u201cEven if they\u2019re not old enough to vote, they can still have a voice within what\u2019s happening,\u201d said Johari Harris, an assistant research professor and project director of the Charlottesville Freedom School. \u201cThey are still very much a part of this movement.\u201d The Freedom School model, which is rooted in the 1964 Mississippi Freedom Summer project, was well-suited to help students incorporate current events, such as the pandemic and protests, into their oral history projects. \u201c[CDF is] very much focused on social movements and empowering students to be like civic actors in their local, state and national community,\u201d Harris said, adding that the curriculum also emphasizes cultures and narratives that have been traditionally marginalized. The UVa team, like other programs this year, had to switch to a virtual model because of the pandemic. Harris said going virtual allowed them to open up more slots for interested students. About 70 students from Charlottesville and Albemarle County schools started the program. During the five weeks, the students, whom the program refers to as \u201cscholars,\u201d went on virtual field trips to Monticello and to the Civil Rights Trail and worked on oral history projects. Each morning of the session focused on literacy skills through a live online program. Classes started at 9:30 a.m. daily. In the afternoons, the scholars had one-on-one sessions with their teachers for tutoring and relationship-building. There also were optional movie nights. Harris said Charlottesville and Albemarle schools provided the technology and hotspots, if needed, for students. They also had a bi-weekly pickup of materials where families could get school supplies, T-shirts and books. The Curry School's Center for Race and Public Education in the South partnered with Charlottesville City Schools to bring the program to the area. \u201cGiven the events in of August 2017, our colleagues in the center and members of the Charlottesville community thought a Freedom School could serve as a concrete way for the university and local community to collaborate on a project serving children,\u201d Derrick Alridge, a UVa professor and director of the center, said in a news release. \u201cGrounded in ideals of freedom and social justice, we believe a Freedom School could help bring about healing in Charlottesville and show our collective commitment to advancing civil rights and social justice in our time.\u201d Charlottesville teacher Christen Edwards oversaw the day-to-day operations as the site coordinator. Harris credited Edwards, the program staff, their partners and the students\u2019 parents for helping to make the first Freedom School successful. \u201cWhen there were technology issues, they were working through it, being patient with us and helping their children kind of engage with us,\u201d Harris said. The Freedom School was open to any student in third through fifth grade, and UVa students helped to teach the different sessions. \u201cIt\u2019s been pretty incredible,\u201d Harris said. \u201cSpeaking as project director, I was a little nervous. It was virtual programming in the middle of a pandemic.\u201d","142":"Furloughs and salary reductions at the University of Virginia Health System will not be extended. In April, it was announced that some employees were furloughed and others took a 20% pay cut as the UVa Health System saw surgeries and clinical visits drop by 70% and 90%, respectively, following Gov. Ralph Northam\u2019s order halting elective procedures. Dr. K. Craig Kent, executive vice president for health affairs at UVa, announced on Twitter earlier this week that the system was ending its financial mitigation measures and soon will be welcoming all faculty and staff back to work. \u201cI am so proud of everyone\u2019s hard work and sacrifice over the last three months,\u201d he said. \u201cTogether, we helped secure our future.\u201d As of mid-May, 561 Health System employees and 78 School of Medicine employees had been placed on full-time, unpaid furlough. Spokesman Eric Swensen said no UVa Health System furloughs will be extended beyond the initial designated three-month period. Furloughs at the Medical Center will end July 25 and furloughs at the School of Medicine will end Aug. 16. The Health System resumed elective procedures in May once the governor\u2019s order was lifted, as has been advertising that it is \u201cSafe. Ready. Open.\u201d since the late spring. In June, the Medical Center expanded its visitation policy for inpatient units and procedural areas. Swensen said the hospital has two units in its new South Tower dedicated to COVID care, but declined to say how many patients the units currently have.","143":null,"144":"\u201cA lot of what we do in preschool is learning through play,\u201d she said. \u201cBuilding with blocks and all that stuff.\u201d But she\u2019s having a hard time visualizing what her classroom will look like come fall under the state\u2019s Phase III guidelines for child care providers, which lay out a series of rigorous health recommendations for reopening. Those include six-foot social distancing between children, \u201crobust\u201d sanitation practices and cloth face coverings for staff and students over the age of two. For children under four, group size is limited to 12, including teachers (that increases to 22 for children four and older). Those groups should not mix, per the recommendations, and \u201cindividual play\u201d is strongly encouraged. The guidelines have left Efford with several unanswered questions. How can she make sure a group of four-year-olds keeps their masks on all day? How does she tell her students that they can\u2019t hug each other in the classroom? And how can she implement the guidelines without losing the basic tenets of early childhood education, which emphasizes social and emotional development? Then there are logistical questions about running a preschool during the COVID-19 pandemic. Efford said there\u2019s a quarantine room reserved at Scottsville Elementary School, where her program is based, for any student who starts showing signs of COVID-19 on campus. But she said she still hasn\u2019t seen a detailed plan on what would happen if the school had a confirmed case. And what if she came down with symptoms? She\u2019d need a substitute for at least a few days before the results came back, \u201cand we have a countywide sub shortage,\u201d Efford said. If she did get COVID, she knows she would be expected to quarantine. But what about her young students? \u201cThat\u2019s a huge question for me and I haven\u2019t heard any answers along those lines,\u201d Efford said. Nor has she gotten guidance from the school about ways to change her curriculum to adapt to the new guidance. Like many providers, her feelings right now are mixed. While some of the guidelines seem \u201cstrange\u201d or almost unworkable (Efford wonders what she\u2019ll do for students who can\u2019t tie their own shoes), they\u2019re also one of the only clear protections against new infections. Scientific evidence on COVID-19 transmission among schoolchildren is still mixed, and Efford said she\u2019s not confident that the state has enough testing and tracing resources to keep people safe. As the debate over how to reopen K-12 schools continues to rage across Virginia, child care providers have been notably absent from the discussion. Unlike schools, day care facilities and preschools were never required to close. In fact, in the first several weeks of the pandemic, Gov. Ralph Northam encouraged providers to stay open to care for children of essential workers. But parents and providers say navigating the guidelines has become an increasing challenge, especially as the rest of the state opens back up. As of July 14, 2,261 of Virginia\u2019s more than 6,000 child care care centers had closed \u2014 nearly 40 percent, according to the Virginia Department of Social Services, which regulates child care programs. Only 664 of those closed centers have contacted the agency to provide a reopening date, spokeswoman Cletisha Lovelace wrote in a Wednesday email. It\u2019s created a conundrum for many working parents, who are increasingly being asked to return to work with no clear options for child care. \u201cAre you going to be drawing straws?\u201d said Andrew Pennock, an assistant professor of public policy at the University of Virginia. \u201cBecause that\u2019s pretty crazy.\u201d Another problem, he pointed out, is that the state\u2019s guidelines are forcing some facilities to reduce class sizes even if they do remain open. Pennock said his family\u2019s co-op preschool in Charlottesville had to reduce enrollment from 26 students to 20 \u2014 almost a quarter of the school\u2019s normal capacity. \u201cWhich means, in practice, that we\u2019ve reduced our tuition as well,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to run a deficit this year because of that and because we\u2019ve had to hire extra staff. So, if we didn\u2019t have an endowment, we wouldn\u2019t be financially solvent.\u201d Child care providers across Virginia are facing similar challenges. Class size limits and new \u201cno-mixing policies\u201d are likely to become some of the biggest hurdles for providers, most of whom already operate on \u201crazor-thin margins,\u201d according to one study on the impacts of COVID-19 on early education in Louisiana. While some providers in the survey expressed concerns over finding crucial materials such as hand sanitizer, disinfectant cleaners and gloves, the price of those items would likely be far outweighed by staffing costs and reduced enrollment fees, said Anna Markowitz, an assistant professor at the University of California, Los Angeles\u2019 School of Education and Information Studies. \u201cMoving forward, those costs will still exist, but they\u2019ll be small relative to the changed operational costs that come around with new rules and regulations,\u201d added Markowitz, who collaborated with UVA researchers on the study. Reducing class size has an obvious effect on enrollment, but guidelines preventing groups of children from mixing also has an impact on staffing, she said. In Virginia, like most states, licensed child care providers have to follow set staff-to-children ratios, which are highest for babies and toddlers. \u201cSo, a director might have to plan for the maximum number of infants showing up,\u201d Markowitz said. \u201cBut if they don\u2019t show up that day, not only do they lose that revenue, but they also have to pay this teacher. Normally, they could flip them into another classroom, but instead, they kind of just have to be there. Because they can\u2019t go work with other kids.\u201d It\u2019s a particular challenge for state-subsidized providers, who typically receive funding based on enrollment. The state\u2019s $70 million allocation of CARES Act funding was intended to help mitigate some of those costs. According to VDSS, the state increased the number of paid absences for subsidized child care providers through April, May and June, allowing them to receive reimbursements even if their programs were closed. They also provided grants to child care centers that remained open and followed the state\u2019s safety guidelines. Northam even set aside $500,000 for local school districts who stepped in to provide emergency child care during the closures (though none of the state\u2019s 132 school divisions have taken advantage of the funding, according to Charles Pyle, spokesman for the Virginia Department of Education). A total of 2,566 programs have been approved to receive CARES Act grant, according to Lovelace. But Emily Griffey, policy director for the child advocacy group Voices for Virginia\u2019s Children, said some providers are reporting that they still haven\u2019t received their funding. Distributions were also capped at $100 times half the licensed capacity at each facility for April, May and June (for example, $2,500 per month for a provider with a capacity of 50 children or $600 for a capacity of 12). \u201cSo, for smaller providers, that\u2019s clearly not making up what you would normally have received from tuition,\u201d Griffey said. VDSS reported that it awarded just over $23 million through its 2,566 grants, but it\u2019s unclear how the remaining funding will be distributed. If the subsidies aren\u2019t extended past June, Griffey said providers will continue to struggle. At the federal level, there\u2019s proposed legislation to increase funding for child care, but the future of the bill is still uncertain. \u201cThere is a real concern that eventually places will shutter and eventually families will not have a place to send their kids,\u201d Markowitz said. \u201cThe calls for bailing out child care that you\u2019re starting to see \u2014 that\u2019s really what it\u2019s about. It\u2019s saying, \u2018This is not going to work. There\u2019s going to be massive closures.\u2019\u201d The Center for American Progress has estimated that up to 45 percent of Virginia\u2019s child care capacity could close without adequate support. Pennock said there are ongoing questions over whether Virginia\u2019s reopening guidelines are \u201cfinancially feasible\u201d for providers, a concern echoed by working parents whose daycares have closed or reduced class sizes. But both Griffey and Markowitz pointed out that it\u2019s difficult to avoid safety restrictions amid ongoing concerns over whether in-person classes are safe for students and teachers. Griffey said she\u2019s heard from child care providers in Northern Virginia and the Hampton Roads region who experienced cases of COVID-19 \u2014 among both children and staff \u2014 and received inconsistent guidance from their local health departments on how long to close and how siblings should be treated. While the Virginia Department of Health lists outbreaks in \u201ceducational settings\u201d on its public dashboard, it\u2019s refused to provide a breakdown of how many cases have occurred in preschools, colleges, or K-12 schools. Some parents just aren\u2019t ready to send their children back to daycare. Efford said her program typically has between 10 to 12 students enrolled, but so far this year, only six have signed up. Samantha Spinney, an education researcher in Fairfax County, said the daycare where she sent her two-year-old son closed temporarily in March but plans to reopen this August. A couple weeks after it closed, she and her husband had their second child, which helped them decide not to re-enroll for the next year or so. \u201cWe ended up hiring a nanny instead to minimize our risk, especially since we have a newborn,\u201d Spinney wrote in an email on Tuesday. For other parents, the shortage of child care options has become a significant source of stress. Haley Feldhaus, who works at a fitness center in Northern Virginia, said she was furloughed after gyms in Virginia closed, which allowed her to care for her two sons \u2014 then in preschool and first grade \u2014 while their schools were shut down. Now that she\u2019s back at work, she\u2019s juggling child care and her job and wondering what to do if school goes fully remote in the fall. \u201cIf I have to quit my job, my family will be okay,\u201d she said. \u201cBut not every mom has that luxury, and there\u2019s really no solutions being offered for two-parent working households. The conversation is not even being had. And that\u2019s the frustration for me. What I\u2019m hearing is that, \u2018Okay, in 2020, I can either have kids or have a job, but not both.\u2019\u201d","145":"Thomas Jefferson Health District officials have received about 200 complaints for non-compliance with Gov. Ralph Northam\u2019s executive order requiring face masks as questions of enforcement linger when businesses and people don\u2019t cooperate with the rule. Health district officials say they are teaming up with the Virginia Alcoholic Beverage Control to make sure restaurants, bars and venues follow the face mask mandates. For businesses over which the health district does not have regulatory power, officials said they will work with those state agencies that do. \u201cIt\u2019s safe to say the health district has about 200 complaints for businesses from restaurants to grocery stores and retail stores,\u201d said Kathryn Goodman, district spokeswoman. \u201cIf it\u2019s a restaurant, we follow up in 24 hours. We\u2019re trying to follow up on complaints as quickly as we can. If it\u2019s a retail business, we refer the complaint to the lead agency, such as the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services.\u201d The Thomas Jefferson Health District is one of 35 health districts under the Virginia Department of Health and serves an estimated 250,000 people in the city of Charlottesville and the counties of Albemarle, Fluvanna, Greene, Louisa and Nelson. The state health department and its districts remained in charge of investigating complaints and enforcing the requirements in Northam\u2019s Executive Order 67 signed on June 30. That order allowed larger gatherings and permitted more businesses to reopen during the COVID-19 pandemic. On Wednesday, Northam ordered stricter enforcement of the executive order when the number of COVID-19 cases surged after the order lifted some restrictions on bars, beaches and public gatherings and people flocked to these locales, often without face coverings and in close proximity. \u201cIt is clear that step one is stronger enforcement because, quite frankly, of non-compliance,\u201d Northam said at a Wednesday press conference. \u201cIf you are a restaurant or a business and not following regulations, your license will be on the line.\u201d University of Virginia students in town last weekend to celebrate the annual Midsummers tradition were seen packing into night spots and restaurants, as well as parties, ignoring requirements for both face masks and social distancing. \u201cDespite rapidly rising cases of COVID-19 in many parts of the country, students were observed by peers and others in the community disregarding social distancing requirements and forgoing use of facial masks,\u201d Allen W. Groves, UVa\u2019s dean of students, wrote in an email to the university community Wednesday. Groves said he heard some students defended themselves by saying they are young, healthy and not at risk of serious health conditions caused by COVID-19. \u201cTo be clear, such an argument should be seen by each of us as repugnant to any idea of fundamental decency towards our fellow citizens,\u201d Groves wrote. The governor said businesses should refuse to serve maskless patrons, calling police if the patrons refuse to leave. He also directed enforcement teams made up of state agencies to conduct unannounced visits to enforce the rules. \u201cIf a patron in your establishment is violating the rules, you have the ability to say no service,\u201d Northam said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to serve a patron who is not wearing a face mask. You can tell them to leave, and if they don\u2019t, they are trespassing and you can in turn call the police.\u201d Goodman said the health district prefers to educate business owners and patrons rather than take enforcement actions that may range from restrictions on business to shutting down an establishment or seeking misdemeanor criminal charges. \u201cWe try to be sure that people understand the rules and have what they need to make sure patrons can wear face masks,\u201d she said. \u201cOur goal is to educate the businesses and make sure they have policies and procedures in place.\u201d Because the health department is not a law enforcement organization, a complaint filed with the district will not result in immediate enforcement. \u201cIt is hard to enforce this,\u201d Goodman said. \u201cBut businesses do have the right to refuse service to any patron not wearing a mask.\u201d Several chain stores recently started requiring customers to don masks. On Thursday, Target and CVS announced national masking requirements. They joined Costco, Walmart, Best Buy, Kohl\u2019s, Harris Teeter and Kroger. \u201cTo be clear, we\u2019re not asking our store employees to play the role of enforcer,\u201d Jon Roberts, chief operating officer at CVS, told The Associated Press. \u201cWhat we are asking is that customers help protect themselves and those around them by listening to the experts and heeding the call to wear a face covering.\u201d The face mask requirement has become a source of contention, taking on political connotations and resulting in angry and violent confrontations across the country. In a suburb of Lansing, Michigan, a man not wearing a mask knifed a 77-year-old mask-wearing man after being called out for not covering his face. The attacker was later shot and killed by a sheriff\u2019s deputy after rushing the deputy with the knife. Locally, customers have yelled at each other about mask wearing, fumed to store management about those not wearing masks and harangued store employees who ask them to mask up. Although few studies have been published, psychologists at several universities suggest the fervor and furor over mask requirements is likely due to pandemic-caused stress and insecurity at a time when jobs are being lost, the economy is listless, an election is approaching and people are being bombarded with news and views. \u201cThe pandemic is a different time for everyone and uniquely challenging to each individual,\u201d said Elizabeth Irving, executive director of the Charlottesville-based Women\u2019s Initiative, which provides counseling and support for area women. \u201cWe know that anxiety and depression are increasing, as well as a sense of isolation, and a lot of people feel powerless.\u201d For some, being required to wear a mask makes them feel like they are losing more control over their lives, some psychologists have suggested. But Irving said wearing a mask can be a way of taking control. \u201cWhen you feel anxious and overwhelmed and everything seems out of control, making the decision to wear a mask is one way you can feel that you\u2019re doing something positive for yourself,\u201d she said. \u201cIt can feel like a proactive step: You\u2019re doing something to increase your safety and that of others.\u201d Irving said limiting time on social media and news and political programs is another way to ease anxiety and anger. \u201cIt can be incredibly hard to take a break because the flow of information has become such a part of our daily lives, but it\u2019s important to step back and take a break,\u201d she said.","146":"Caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, also known as the novel coronavirus, COVID-19 presents doctors, nurses and researchers with medical mysteries from people with the virus who don\u2019t pass it on to those who spread it prodigiously; from people never showing symptoms to others languishing in intensive care. For those who end up hospitalized, about 20% develop pulmonary complications so severe that they need machines to help them breathe. \u201cBecause this virus is unique, the human immune system doesn\u2019t know how to respond to it,\u201d said Dr. William Petri of UVa's Division of Infectious Diseases and International Health. \u201cFor some, the virus seems to trigger a widespread attack on the immune system unlike anything we\u2019ve seen in other infectious diseases. It\u2019s like it goes through the body and turns on every switch in the immune system. It\u2019s a terrible disease.\u201d Petri and his team of UVa researchers\u00a0\u2014 Allie Donlan, Mary Young and Mayuresh Abhyankar\u00a0\u2014 may have found a puzzle piece to help detect who might suffer the most severe responses to the virus. The piece is called Interleukin 13, IL-13 for short. A cytokine peptide, IL-13 is a creation of the immune system often found in patients suffering allergies, especially those that cause bouts of asthma and bronchitis. The peptide creates inflammation in response to allergies and infections and attracts other immune cells to help fight invaders. \u201cIt\u2019s a way that white blood cells communicate with each other. If a cell makes IL-13, it activates other cells to go to where IL-13 is located,\u201d Petri said. But if a body creates too much IL-13, pneumonia or severe asthma may result, with sometimes fatal impact. The last decade of research has shown that treating patients with Interleukin 13 blockers can help them recover from pulmonary problems. The cytokine also is associated with some cancers, and some cancer-related immunotherapies have been devised around the peptide. In a review of patients hospitalized for COVID-19,\u00a0Petri\u2019s research found that high levels of IL-13 were associated with worsened outcomes regardless of patient gender, age or health problems. \u201cAbout one of every five patients hospitalized with COVID-19 requires a respirator and what [the research team] discovered is that, compared with people who didn\u2019t need a respirator, those who did had much higher Interleukin 13 levels,\u201d Petri said. Researchers know that the virus causing COVID-19 creates cytokine storms, sudden all-out creation of the many peptides used by the immune system. The crush of cytokines can overwhelm the body and result in organ damage or death. \u201cIt\u2019s like when you enter an elevator and some little kid has hit every single button. Everybody who has looked into it has been astonished at how activated the immune system is by this virus.\u201d Petri said. \u201cIf you look at a patient and you see all of the cytokines elevated, looking at the proportions, you will see it\u2019s the IL-13 that\u2019s most elevated.\u201d If IL-13 proves to be a factor in severe COVID-19 cases, doctors may be able to determine who needs the most treatment before they need it simply by checking the blood of patients being admitted to the hospital. \u201cThat\u2019s what we hope. We know that higher levels are more prevalent in pneumonia cases, and we need to find out if that\u2019s because it\u2019s causing the pneumonia or if it\u2019s reacting to pneumonia and trying to save you from pneumonia,\u201d he said. \u201cWe suspect that a higher level may be a bad thing.\u201d That bad thing, however, could be a good thing, if found quickly enough. \u201cIf it\u2019s the case, there are drugs that target Interleukin 13 already available because of its relation to allergies,\u201d Petri said. UVa researchers are conducting more study to determine whether IL-13 is a cause or a symptom. \u201cIt\u2019s a hypothesis, and the scientific method is about testing your hypothesis,\u201d he said. \u201cIf it turns out to be wrong, it could provide more information to help someone else\u2019s research. At the least, it\u2019s a dead end you won\u2019t have to go down again.\u201d In the meantime, researchers across the university, the country and the world are looking into numerous aspects of how the virus does what it does. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely pedal-to-the-metal for researchers looking into this disease, looking at the information and saying to themselves, \u2018what do I know from my research that might apply?\u2019 There is an all-out effort across the country,\u201d Petri said. That is apparent at UVa, where researchers delving into cancer, HIV and other areas have switched gears to study the novel coronavirus. Others are looking at their previous, seemingly research in terms of COVID-19, and the government has altered grants and research funding to focus on the pandemic. \u201cIt\u2019s really inspiring to be around here. Everyone who is a scientist is thinking, \u2018what do I know that could possibly be helpful?\u2019 This is very much a foot-to-the-floor situation as far as research,\u201d Petri said. Research from around the world is being made available for others to study, and the U.S. government is backing several possible vaccines simultaneously. \u201cThere have been a lot of advances in the past 10 years and we know so much today that we didn\u2019t before,\u201d Petri said. \u201cBut at the same time, when I make rounds in the hospital, patients and doctors and nurses have so many questions we just can\u2019t answer, yet. That\u2019s what we hope to do, find those answers.\u201d","147":"As a rising senior at Virginia Tech, Andrew Williams is \u201cstrongly encouraged\u201d to test negative for COVID-19 before arriving on the Blacksburg campus next month. But he probably won\u2019t get that test. Not unless such an opportunity becomes more widely available around his home in the Hampton Roads area, where he works as a construction site inspector. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely ideal, but it\u2019s definitely not as realistic,\u201d Williams, 21, said of Tech\u2019s testing plan, which includes asking students to quarantine for two weeks before returning. \u201cPeople are doing different things, and some people can\u2019t just have that time to isolate before they go back.\u201d Meanwhile, Williams\u2019 sister, who attends the University of Virginia, will be sent a test kit in the mail, which she is required to return with a negative result\u00a0before being allowed on Grounds. Radford University plans to test 1,700 on-campus students upon their arrival, while Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond aims to mail tests to all residential students. As Virginia colleges prepare to reopen next month, guided by a patchwork of plans, questions are arising from faculty, parents and students about whether universities, and the students themselves, can control the spread of COVID-19: Are college testing plans stringent enough? Will students take physical distancing seriously? Is it safe to hold classes on campus? \u201cIf we continue on this trajectory in a month, there are no ways that any schools at any levels are going to be open,\u201d Katie Carmichael, an associate professor of English at Tech, said Tuesday about national trends, noting that increased travel, especially to small college towns, will increase spread of the virus. \u201cI think that any amount of movement is tempting fate.\u201d Amid a spike in COVID-19 cases in the Hampton Roads area, mostly among the young, Hampton University on Monday reversed course on reopening campus and announced classes would be online only. Big-name schools, including Harvard and Yale universities, have said all of their classes will be remote for the fall. But elsewhere in Virginia, 31 out of 33 colleges are planning for some type of in-person classes, according to a Chronicle of Higher Education tally as of Thursday. \u201cI am concerned about the return of students to campus because they are in the classroom for only a few hours a day, and we can\u2019t control what they do during the other hours of the day,\u201d Linsey Marr, a Tech professor and expert on the airborne transmission of diseases, said in an email Wednesday. Although Marr isn\u2019t teaching this fall, she said she would be comfortable holding in-person classes \u2014 so long as students wear masks and the room has proper ventilation, which she would measure with a portable carbon dioxide sensor. But outside the classroom is another matter. \u201cI am not confident that 20-year-olds will follow guidelines for distancing and avoiding crowds because I remember being that age and highly valuing socializing with friends and taking risks,\u201d she said. \u201cI expect to see a lot more cases in Montgomery County.\u201d Issues with testing Anyone who wants a COVID-19 test can get tested, President Donald Trump said in March and again in May. That remains untrue today, according to the Virginia Department of Health. \u201cAt this time, the New River Health District does not have the capacity to test every person returning to a college or university campus, and VDH does not recommend campus-wide testing of students or faculty\/staff upon arrival or at certain set intervals,\u201d Bobby Parker, a department spokesman, said in an email Friday. So with the prospect of thousands of people on campuses, Virginia colleges must submit a plan to the state that includes a testing strategy. Local health departments help to guide those. \u201cAgain, one size does not fit all, and these are complicated and difficult decisions to make,\u201d Gov. Ralph Northam said Tuesday. Testing by colleges only makes sense without certain restrictions, said Thomas Kerkering, a Virginia Tech professor in the field of infectious disease and a member of the Roanoke health district\u2019s communicable disease team, as 40% to 80% of people who test positive have no symptoms. \u201cSo it doesn\u2019t really do any good to limit testing to only those who have symptoms,\u201d Kerkering said Tuesday on a health department conference call. \u201cIt would have to be a more generalized population that\u2019s returning.\u201d Yet some college testing plans, such as those at Roanoke College and Hollins University, do not initially involve the testing of students who may be asymptomatic. Both colleges said the plans, which are subject to change, were made in consultation with VDH epidemiologists. In its four-page \u201cinterim testing recommendations\u201d for colleges, VDH recommends testing for asymptomatic persons who have had close contact with people who tested positive for COVID-19, only \u201cas resources permit.\u201d If anything is to help Tech reopen in the fall, President Tim Sands said in May, \u201cit\u2019s going to be the ability to test significant numbers of individuals, not just on campus but in the community, with less than 24-hour turnaround.\u201d A Tech spokesman Friday said the amount of testing supplies and the capacity to analyze them will become clearer closer to the start of the semester. Tech\u2019s testing plan asks an estimated 9,000 on-campus students to get tested, which the university says would give a representative snapshot of 30% of the total student population. The plan also encourages other students to get tested off-site and remain in quarantine, recommendations students and parents say will be hard to do. \u201cI\u2019m just spinning in circles because I refuse to pay for a test that could be false negative, false positive,\u201d Gail Asher, 59, of Newport News, said about trying to secure a test for her son, who does not have symptoms. \u201cHe could pick it up on the way down to Blacksburg.\u201d \u201cVirginia Tech recognized that access to COVID tests is not consistent across the country,\u201d Tech spokesman Mark Owczarski said in an email Friday. \u201cThat is why in the plan, testing prior to returning is a recommendation. The additional recommendation to quarantine for 14 days prior to return minimizes the opportunity to return to Blacksburg with the virus.\u201d Deborah Mayo, a professor emerita at Tech who studies the philosophy of statistics, said Tech\u2019s testing plan\u2019s \u201cvague and not enforceable\u201d rules risk causing an outbreak. \u201cI think it\u2019s completely an ill-laid out plan,\u201d Mayo said. \u201cSomething has to be done to fix it, to improve it, or we\u2019re really going to have a serious problem in the fall.\u201d She said the university should consider pooled testing, which can test more people cost-effectively, but whose efficacy remains in its infancy when it comes to COVID-19. \u201cThe university considered numerous options,\u201d Owczarski said. \u201cIf or as guidance evolves or circumstances related to the pandemic change, Virginia Tech (as it has done) will consider or reconsider other options.\u201d Containing the spread Testing alone is not a panacea. \u201cA person can become infected after the test has been taken,\u201d the health department\u2019s guide to colleges notes. \u201cThe test results should not be seen as implying that someone who tested negative on the date of the test will continue to not pose a risk to the campus community.\u201d Wearing masks, physical distancing and frequent hand-washing will be critical. Laura Hungerford, head of the Department of Population Health Sciences at Virginia-Maryland College of Veterinary Medicine, said that while the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates 40% to 60% of spread is asymptomatic, that means 40% to 60% of spread is symptomatic. \u201cSo, if one person infects two others, this would mean that one of them, on average, would show signs and we would find them after just one transmission cycle,\u201d Hungerford said in an email. \u201cThis is why health districts strongly emphasize contact tracing. When we find the case that shows signs, it should lead us to find and test others to determine who gave the infection to them and then trace where the disease may be spreading.\u201d Aris Spanos, a professor of economics at Tech, also expressed concern about the potential for COVID-19 to spread on campus by those without symptoms. \u201cI predicted that we\u2019re going to rush the opening and get ourselves in trouble, and that\u2019s exactly what happened,\u201d Spanos said about recent nationwide case trends, noting that Virginia, and Tech itself, do not exist in a vacuum. \u201cI expect in a group of 15,000, we will have, let\u2019s say, at least 100 [infected] who will show absolutely no symptoms,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that is enough to start a real problem within a couple of weeks.\u201d Parker, the health department spokesman, did not respond to a direct question about how many contact tracers the New River Health District has or hopes to have by September. He said, \u201cWe are currently handling our caseload and have a plan for surge, as we do expect an increase in cases as the students return and our population increases.\u201d If one is worried about transmission, Hungerford said, \u201cthen the best thing we can do is to adopt practices that stop spread \u2014 wearing masks, physical distancing and practicing good hygiene \u2014 which have been shown to inhibit spread even when there are infected people among us.\u201d That\u2019s why masks are required on campuses, faculty will teach behind shields and most classroom occupancy is reduced by about 75% and capped at 49 students. Blacksburg Mayor Leslie Hager-Smith said the town works closely with Tech, and she doesn\u2019t share her Charlottesville counterpart\u2019s assessment that UVa\u2019s opening will be \u201ca recipe for disaster.\u201d In her view, testing is the \u201cleast effective part of staying safe,\u201d and that \u201cnone of that is as important as practices we can put into play,\u201d such as physical distancing and wearing masks. \u201cThe bugaboo, really the big concern, is that there are going to be out-of-control parties,\u201d Hager-Smith said. Dr. Noelle Bissell, director of the New River Health District, said that residents shouldn\u2019t hold students to a higher standard. \u201cThe students are not bringing in COVID. It\u2019s here,\u201d she said Thursday at an economic development conference. \u201cIt\u2019s all over the New River Valley. \u2026 There\u2019s no bad place. There\u2019s bad behavior. It\u2019s not where you go, it\u2019s what you do.\u201d Williams, the rising Tech senior, expects he won\u2019t travel over fall break or engage in as many activities as usual. \u201cWe have this kind of imaginary vision of what college was like before the pandemic,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of things that make college fun, I think, like concerts that we have, and social gatherings that would be organized at the beginning of the semester, and hanging out with friends, are just not going to happen.\u201d And he\u2019s left with his own unanswered questions: Will football happen? Will he work his campus dining job? How will buses deal with physical distancing? \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody knows what\u2019s really going to happen,\u201d he said. \u201cEverything changes, every single day.\u201d","148":"Have you been ill or anxious? Have you lost your job, had a hard time paying bills or buying food? Or has life been more or less the same, but different? While you might feel you\u2019ve been talking about nothing but the coronavirus since March, Virginia\u2019s researchers haven\u2019t had a unified way to tap into that information until now. A COVID-19 registry is being developed so that scientists can find answers to their questions from Virginians. The Virginia Department of Health provides a wealth of daily data, where researchers can go to find out basic information about the 80,393 cases of COVID-19 that have been reported as of Wednesday, and that have caused 7,351 hospitalizations and 2,051 deaths. But they can\u2019t easily know how the disease has affected people\u2019s lives and livelihoods, and what the differences are across communities. The COVID-19 database seeks to provide some of the answers. The Integrated Translational Health Institute of Virginia, known by its simpler name of iTHRIV, has partnered with the Health Department to collect information from people and make it available to qualified researchers. Any Virginian who wants can contribute to the COVID-19 database. That information will then be shared over secured systems with researchers whose projects have been approved to use the data. \u201cWe just have a tiny sliver of information as to what is happening in our state. So we are trying to supplement that with a standard set of questions,\u201d said Johanna Loomba, who is leading the iTHRIV research team at the University of Virginia. \u201cWe had scientists with the Department of Health and our partner institutions come up with those questions to say here are the things we have been trying to gather information on,\u201d she said. \u201cSometimes you see one-off surveys go out and ask people about social distancing or the impact of jobs or other such things. Rather than it be small, small efforts that are only used by one team of researchers, our goal is to create a broad bank of data that can be reused by many people and also can be updated over time.\u201d ITHRIV is a partnership formed by UVa, Virginia Tech, Carilion Clinic and Inova Health System and funded by a $23 million award last year from the National Institutes of Health. The goal is to collaborate, rather than compete, on projects to advance the pace of medical discoveries from labs to clinics. \u201cThere are many ideas that people have in terms of looking at social inequity issues in the state,\u201d Loomba said. ITHRIV will begin soon reviewing researchers\u2019 proposals. \u201cAll of these projects will be published on our website so the public will be able to watch and see who is using the data over time,\u201d she said. To participate, go to the website and answer the survey questions, which gather demographic information and then ask about whether you have been tested, infected or hospitalized with the disease. It also asks if you comply with social distancing and whether there are changes in your physical, mental or emotional health; if you are a health care worker; have lost income; have difficulty paying bills or accessing the internet. Loomba said that participants can go in later and change any of the information should their circumstances change. The Health Department will be leading the marketing campaign to ask people to participate. The survey is open to all Virginians, and there is no limit as to how many can participate. \u201cThe more people who contribute their data, the better. We\u2019d like to have all communities represented,\u201d she said.","149":"Albemarle County is considering making masks mandatory in public, limiting restaurants to 50% occupancy indoors and restricting public and private in-person gatherings to a maximum of 50 people. During a special meeting on Wednesday, the Albemarle Board of Supervisors discussed the measures as the COVID-19 pandemic rages on. Last week, the supervisors said they wanted to go back to the regulations that were in place under Phase Two of the state\u2019s reopening guidelines, in light of a then-increasing COVID-19 percent positivity rate and the specter of University of Virginia students returning to the area. The board Wednesday decided to defer a vote on the ordinance until its regular meeting on August 5, or at an earlier special meeting, so county staff can get prepared and to give Charlottesville and the University of Virginia time to review the ordinance. \u201cWe\u2019re obviously interested in having regional coordination, so they\u2019ll have the opportunity to see it and see if they would like to go along, so that there can be some parallel ordinance,\u201d Board Chair Ned Gallaway said after the meeting. The emergency ordinance under consideration by the board states that the authority to implement the regulations is within the general powers of counties outlined in state code. The law says counties can adopt measures \u201cto secure and promote the health, safety and general welfare of its inhabitants which are not inconsistent with the general laws of the Commonwealth,\u201d including \u201cthe adoption of necessary regulations to prevent the spread of contagious diseases among persons.\u201d A spokesperson for Gov. Ralph Northam said Tuesday that the statewide \u201cForward Virginia\u201d phases represent a floor for regulations, not a ceiling. \u201c[Northam] welcomes localities\u2019 requests in consultation with their local health departments,\u201d Alena Yarmosky said in an email. Yarmosky said the governor had not heard from either Albemarle or Charlottesville, which has also discussed returning to Phase Two, as of Tuesday. She did not answer an email asking whether localities must request permission to revert. According to the draft ordinance, indoor occupancy at food establishments, farm wineries, limited breweries, and limited distilleries would be capped at 50% of the lowest occupancy load, or not more than 50 persons. Workers do not count toward the limits. Violations could result in the owner being charged with a Class 3 misdemeanor, according to the ordinance. All public and private in-person gatherings of more than 50 people would be prohibited, except for outdoor gatherings for activities allowed at farm wineries, limited breweries, and limited distilleries, gatherings for religious exercises, including religious ceremonies, and wedding ceremonies and receptions. People working do not count toward the limits. Violations could result in the business or property owner being charged with a Class 3 misdemeanor, and those attending could be charged with a Class 4 misdemeanor, according to the ordinance. A gathering, according to the ordinance, does not include a place of employment, events or activities on the grounds of an institution of higher education- or public or private school-owned property, or persons engaging in religious exercise at their place of worship or other place of religious significance. The ordinance also includes a face covering mandate in public places, except for children 10 and under, those for whom wearing a face covering \u201cposes certain risks\u201d and employees of the public place for which regulations established by a state entity apply. Face coverings would not be required to be worn during outdoor activities, if people maintain six feet of distance between each other, or while eating food or drinking. Violators could be charged with a Class 4 misdemeanor, according to the ordinance. County Attorney Greg Kamptner said hired ambassadors would do preliminary enforcement, but that the Albemarle County Police Department would come in later. The police would enforce instead of the health department, Kamptner said, because the health department is operating under Phase Three, which allows full occupancy of restaurants. \u201cIt would be up to the health department to make certain that the tables are properly spaced ... all of those types of issues,\u201d he said. \u201cFor PD, it\u2019s really just looking at the occupancy total and counting the heads of the non-employees within the restaurant. Lance Stewart, the county\u2019s director of facilities and environmental services, said the ambassadors would cost roughly $123,000 through the end of the year. \u201cThis is not the board\u2019s one opportunity to deal with the pandemic,\u201d Kamptner said. \u201cSo as circumstances change, we will be coming back with amendments to it that changes the scope.\u201d The Thomas Jefferson Health District at the meeting presented information that showed the University of Virginia Health System\u2019s COVID ICU is full, COVID acute care is at 86% capacity, ICU is at 72% capacity and acute care is at 83% capacity. UVa Health spokesman Eric Swensen said he wasn\u2019t sure where that information came from, and that the university\u2019s COVID caseload is similar to what it has seen through the spring and early summer. \u201cThe number of COVID patients we\u2019re caring for now is within the range of patients we\u2019ve seen over the past few months, and we continue to have capacity to care for both patients with COVID as well as patients with other conditions,\u201d Swensen said. A health district official told the board that UVa Health will not solely cater to local COVID patients. \u201cUVa in particular is not just going to have individuals from our Health District, from the city from the county, they\u2019re really bringing in people from across the state and potentially across state lines,\u201d said Ryan McKay, senior policy analyst for the health district. Gallaway said he was concerned about staffing and capacity at the hospitals, and wanted to know more information. \u201cIf we start to have an uptick, what kind of strain and pressure do we put on our local hospitals to deal with the situation,\u201d he said, \u201cIf there\u2019s a way to get at this to understand fully what we\u2019re looking at ... and then what these capacity levels are, I think would be an important piece of information.\u201d Dr. Denise Bonds, director of the TJHD, said both UVa and Sentara Martha Jefferson have had issues with the ability to discharge people that are ready to go back into places like long term care facilities. \u201cThere\u2019s a little bit of a challenge in getting folks that don\u2019t really need that acute care any longer into a facility where their needs can be more appropriately met, and that has to do with outbreaks that we\u2019re having in long term care facilities\u201d she said. When asked about UVa students coming back, Bonds said she anticipates students will continue to have parties and gatherings as they have this summer. \u201cThat being said, it\u2019s not fair to put the entire burden on UVa, because we\u2019ve seen lots of social gatherings, over the Fourth of July weekend, for example, in the city of Charlottesville where we had two large block parties with several hundred people at them combined, and had a large number of people who were positive out of that as well,\u201d she said. The UVa Health System was supposed to help with additional community testing on behalf of TJHD, but Bonds said that state contract that UVa thought it was going to get to pay for the cost of the tests fell through. \u201cNow it\u2019s not clear that they\u2019re going to be able to do it because they won\u2019t do testing if they have to both pay for all of the employee time plus test costs,\u201d she said. After the meeting, Swensen said that UVa Health is committed to working with the TJHD and the Virginia Department of Health to provide community testing in the Charlottesville area. \u201cWe will have more details to share in the coming days,\u201d he said. Sentara Martha Jefferson Hospital, Bonds said, will not be able to provide community testing after this week. Currently, the TJHD testing team is paid for by a private foundation grant and the state was supposed to fund another testing team, but that funding has not yet come through. \u201cWithout that additional state resource and funding, we\u2019re going to be really hampered,\u201d she said. \u201cSo while things look good now, I\u2019m very worried that come the middle of August when I don\u2019t have UVa necessarily because we can\u2019t figure out how to pay for their tests, and then Sentara has taken that asset back, I\u2019m going to be left with our testing team trying to do the best they can with the resources that we have. So that\u2019s where we\u2019re at.\u201d","150":"Charlottesville appears ready to join Albemarle County in tightening restrictions to slow the spread of the coronavirus. The City Council will hold a virtual special meeting Monday to consider an ordinance related to the virus. The ordinance largely mirrors Albemarle County\u2019s plan to go back to something akin to Phase Two of the state\u2019s reopening plan. The ordinances would make masks mandatory in public, limit restaurants to 50% occupancy indoors and restrict certain public and private in-person gatherings to a maximum of 50 people. Notice of the city\u2019s meeting, which was posted Friday afternoon, says that the council will \u201cconsider, discuss, and take action on an emergency ordinance to address the containment of the novel coronavirus.\u201d The county was scheduled to vote on its ordinance earlier this week, but delayed a vote to give Charlottesville and the University of Virginia time to review the ordinance. The county is moving forward with the ordinance, it appears, without permission from Gov. Ralph Northam. County officials have said the locality has the authority to implement stricter regulations, although areas such as Richmond and Northern Virginia had to request authority to delay moving forward with loosened regulations. A spokesman for Northam said Friday that the statewide Forward Virginia phases represent a floor for regulations, not a ceiling. As of Friday, the governor had not heard from the city or county about changing regulations. When asked if localities need permission from the governor to move back in regulations, spokesman Grant Neely said, \u201cMost city and county charters give their governing bodies a mechanism to take emergency action at the local level, but I\u2019m not aware that any has done so.\u201d Albemarle officials pointed to a section of state code that says a county may adopt measures \u201cto secure and promote the health, safety and general welfare of its inhabitants which are not inconsistent with the general laws of the Commonwealth,\u201d including \u201cthe adoption of necessary regulations to prevent the spread of contagious diseases among persons.\u201d The city plans to focus on Section 14 of its charter, which allows it to establish \u201csuch quarantine regulations against infectious and contagious diseases as the said council may see fit, subject to the laws of the state, and of the United States.\u201d The push to return to stricter regulations comes as the localities are concerned about returning UVa students and an increasing number of COVID-19 cases. Through Friday, the Thomas Jefferson Health District reported 1,551 cases of the virus, with 129 hospitalizations and 46 deaths. Cases have increased 67% since July 1, with 625 cases so far this month, compared with 926 between mid-March and the end of June. A majority of the cases are in Charlottesville and Albemarle, which combine for 1,090 cases, 72 hospitalizations and 18 deaths. Under the county\u2019s proposed ordinance, indoor occupancy at food establishments, farm wineries, limited breweries and limited distilleries would be capped at 50% of the lowest occupancy load, or not more than 50 people. Workers do not count toward the limits. Rather than farm wineries, breweries and distilleries, the city\u2019s ordinance focuses the same regulations on micro-breweries, micro-wineries, micro-distilleries and small breweries. Both ordinances also would prohibit all public and private in-person gatherings of more than 50 people, except for gatherings for religious exercises, including religious ceremonies, and wedding ceremonies and receptions. People working do not count toward the limits. K-12 schools and higher education institutions also would not be subject to the smaller limit on gatherings. Violations could result in the business or property owner being charged with a Class 3 misdemeanor, which carries a $500 fine, and those attending could be charged with a Class 4 misdemeanor, which carries a $250 fine. The ordinances include a face covering mandate in public places, except for children ages 10 and under, those for whom wearing a face covering \u201cposes certain risks\u201d and employees of a public place for which regulations established by a state entity apply. Face coverings would not be required to be worn during outdoor activities so long as people maintain six feet of distance between each other, or while eating food or drinking. County officials have said that \u201chired ambassadors\u201d would conduct enforcement at first before the Albemarle County Police Department started enforcement. It\u2019s unclear what approach the city will take with the ordinance. News of the county\u2019s plans has riled business owners. On Friday, the Virginia Restaurant, Lodging and Travel Association sent a letter to Albemarle officials opposing the ordinance. The letter, signed by President Eric Terry, says his organization understands the need to take appropriate measures, but \u201cthe hospitality and tourism industry have been one of the most heavily impacted\u201d by the pandemic. \u201cIf the county has funding that can be allocated to place additional restrictions that are not supported by public health data on food vendors, the county should provide a restaurant-specific fund to offset their loss of revenue,\u201d the letter says. \u201cImposing new standards will create additional financial hardship and loss of economic activity that will further harm the local recovery.\u201d The Board of Supervisors meets at 3 p.m. Monday to discuss the regulations and the City Council meets at 4 p.m.","151":"Medical wards and intensive care units are filling up in the region\u2019s two hospitals, but officials say that\u2019s caused by more and sicker patients seeking medical care and not a result of a spike in COVID-19 cases. Officials with the University of Virginia Medical Center and Sentara Martha Jefferson Hospital say they have seen a spike in people seeking care for chronic health issues \u2014 care that was delayed during the first few months of the pandemic. Those patients are also sicker, most likely because of the delayed care, official said. \u201cOverall, our ICU numbers have been low and steady and our COVID unit has patients but we haven\u2019t been overflowing,\u201d said Andrea Chapman, infection control practitioner at Martha Jefferson. \u201cWhat we\u2019re really seeing is an increase in the medical unit and the acuity of cases. The increased acuity and raw numbers of patients in the medical units has impacted our capacity way more than COVID.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re busy now, busier than I anticipated, but a lot of that is patients from all over the region being sent to UVa for treatment of serious non-COVID medical issues,\u201d said Dr. Craig Kent, executive vice president for health affairs at UVa. \u201cThe number of those patients in the last two months has grown significantly.\u201d In March, Gov. Ralph Northam ordered a halt to elective surgeries and non-critical treatment at hospitals, dentist offices and veterinarian offices as part of a statewide lockdown designed to keep COVID-19 cases from overwhelming hospitals, as happened in New York City in the early days of the pandemic. Lifesaving medical procedures, trauma treatment and other emergency care were not affected by the order. In May, Northam rescinded the order and allowed medical offices to resume routine care. But some patients were reluctant to make appointments because of the fear that COVID-19 could be caught at the facilities. \u201cWe don\u2019t really know why there has been an increase in the number of people coming in who seem to have more acute medical problems than before the pandemic, but it could be that people were staying away from medical offices,\u201d Kent said. \u201cWe are a teaching hospital and provide care on a level that many local hospitals cannot, and they refer those patients to us. We\u2019re seeing more.\u201d The officials said both hospitals have in place prevention protocols and policies to protect patients from contracting COVID-19. \u201cWe don\u2019t want patients to ignore significant medical problems because they\u2019re worried about the possibility of contracting COVID in the hospital,\u201d said Dr. Paul J. Tesoriere, vice president of medical affairs at Sentara Martha Jefferson. \u201cWe have procedures in place to keep them safe.\u201d Kent said the university hospital has the ability to handle increased COVID cases, should a spike occur. Although recent figures from the Thomas Jefferson Health District showed that UVa\u2019s COVID care ICU was full, Kent said that information was misleading. He said the figure represented only one of many intensive care units at the hospital and that the hospital has the flexibility to turn regular beds into intensive care beds, if needed. \u201cWe have 700 beds at UVa and we have multiple medical intensive care units. We have some units that are now closed and can be reopened, if needed,\u201d Kent said. \u201cWe are in a great position because we have the new tower that we opened just after pandemic and that has 84 beds, all of which are ICU compatible.\u201d Kent said the hospital is seeing about the same population of COVID-19 patients recently that it saw at the beginning of the pandemic. He said the population sometimes spikes as outbreaks occur in nursing homes or other locations and then drops back down as those outbreaks are resolved. Tesoriere echoed Kent. \u201cWe certainly had a fair amount of COVID patients early in April and we saw some spiking around Memorial Day in June, and the whole country is seeing a spike as things open up,\u201d Tesoriere said. \u201cWhen it first hit, probably 50% of our patients were going into ICU and on respirators but we\u2019ve done a good job of avoiding that as many of the newer patients are younger and the research has shown that it\u2019s better to avoid using respirators, if possible,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve developed some different treatment protocols as a result. We\u2019ve been dealing with this virus for months and things are changing so fast. I\u2019ve never seen research come out so quickly and changes come so fast. Everyone is working hard on this,\u201d he said. Officials from both hospitals said that should a surge of COVID cases occur, they currently have the capacity and capability to handle it. \u201cI\u2019m concerned that if, as a community, we don\u2019t follow social distancing and those precautions, that our numbers will go up. All we have to do is look around the nation to see that,\u201d Kent said. \u201cIf that happens, we would do a few things. First, we shut down the elective surgeries again, limit the number of transfers from other hospitals and convert staff and facilities to handle the increase. We have that flexibility.\u201d Sentara Martha Jefferson staff members have continuously reviewed the hospital\u2019s plan for COVID care, officials said. They believe they will have staff and facilities ready should a spike occur. \u201cWe realize COVID-19 is going to be with us a long time,\u201d Chapman said.","152":"Nevertheless, it is more than mere speculation that the return of thousands of students to Charlottesville will be accompanied by a significant increase in COVID cases. This is buttressed by recent reports on Midsummers social gatherings where local bars, fraternity houses and apartments were the scene of large numbers of students partying without masks or social distancing, similar to what has occurred in Florida and California. The local economy will not benefit if businesses are forced to close down, as they did in April and May, because of a major COVID outbreak in our area spawned by that segment of students who are not concerned about catching COVID themselves, but selfishly ignore the danger they can pose to others. Students need to understand that attending the university is not a right but rather a privilege that, in our present circumstances, must be earned by avoiding behaviors that put the health of others at risk. Likewise, the university must enforce its COVID protocols if it wants to receive the economic benefit of tuition and fees. In order to return, students should be required to sign a pledge to strictly abide by the university\u2019s COVID protocols; and if they do not there should be meaningful consequences, including dismissal for the remainder of the semester for intentional violations of that pledge. A violation of the UVa Honor Code results in permanent dismissal from the university. COVID poses a far greater threat to the community than a student\u2019s cheating on a term paper, and it is not unreasonable to impose sanctions on students who decline to voluntarily adhere to rules designed to protect all of us. S. Miles Dumville Albemarle County","153":"Charlottesville and Albemarle County have approved stricter restrictions to slow the spread of the coronavirus. In virtual meetings Monday, the City Council and Board of Supervisors approved similar ordinances targeting the virus. The ordinances make masks mandatory in public, limit restaurants to 50% occupancy indoors and restrict certain public and private in-person gatherings to a maximum of 50 people. The new regulations take effect at 12 a.m. Saturday for a 60-day period. Officials would have to hold a public hearing and another vote to extend the measures. \u201cWe are walking a bit of a tightrope here to make sure we\u2019re taking enough action without taking too much action,\u201d Supervisor Donna Price said. \u201cIf we don\u2019t take enough action, we run the risk of our residents getting infected. \u2026 If we do too much, we have to worry about the economic impact.\u201d The push to return to stricter regulations comes as the localities are concerned about returning University of Virginia students and an increasing number of COVID-19 cases. Through Monday, the Thomas Jefferson Health District reported 1,648 cases of the virus, with 133 hospitalizations and 30 deaths. Cases have increased nearly 78% since July 1, with 722 cases so far this month, compared with 926 between mid-March and the end of June. A majority of the cases in the health district are in Charlottesville and Albemarle, which combine for 1,151 cases, 73 hospitalizations and 18 deaths. Under the county\u2019s ordinance, indoor occupancy at food establishments, farm wineries, limited breweries and limited distilleries is capped at 50% of the lowest occupancy load. For businesses without an occupancy count, capacity is capped at 50 people. Workers do not count toward the limits. Rather than farm wineries, breweries and distilleries, the city\u2019s ordinance includes the same regulations on micro-breweries, micro-wineries, micro-distilleries and small breweries. Both ordinances prohibit all public and private in-person gatherings of more than 50 people, except for gatherings for religious exercises, including religious ceremonies, and wedding ceremonies and receptions. People working do not count toward the limits. The rules also exempt spontaneous demonstrations. K-12 schools and higher education institutions, such as UVa, are not subject to the regulations. A big difference between the two measures are the penalties for violations, which would occur after a warning. Both ordinances initially proposed that a business or property owner could be charged with a Class 3 misdemeanor, which carries a $500 fine, and those attending could be charged with a Class 4 misdemeanor, which carries a $250 fine. Over the weekend, the county upped that penalty to a Class 1 misdemeanor, which could carry up to one year in jail and a $2,500 fine. Albemarle Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney Jim Hingeley said the penalty is in line with Gov. Ralph Northam\u2019s executive orders. The city stuck with the lighter penalties to avoid sending people to jail. \u201cNo judge is going to put somebody in jail for failing to wear a mask,\u201d Councilor Lloyd Snook said. \u201cI see no advantage to having it be a jailable offense.\u201d Board of Supervisor Chairman Ned Galloway said he didn\u2019t have concerns about the difference in penalties. The ordinances include a face covering mandate in public places, except for children ages 10 and under, those for whom wearing a face covering \u201cposes certain risks\u201d and employees of a public place for which regulations established by a state entity apply. Face coverings are not required to be worn during outdoor activities so long as people maintain six feet of distance between each other, or while eating food or drinking. The county\u2019s ordinance allows an exception for anyone \u201cclaiming that wearing a face covering poses a substantial mental or physical health risk.\u201d However, that person would be required to provide documentation specifying the medical necessity and prove that the place they want to enter cannot provide services outside. \u201cThis is not something that can be presented later,\u201d Hingeley said. \u201cIf it were, there would be great difficulty in enforcing the ordinance.\u201d Hingeley said that many retail establishments are offering curbside pickup so those who cannot wear a mask can receive service outside of a building. The city\u2019s ordinance doesn\u2019t include such an exception. The county is planning to hire a third-party vendor for four to six \u201cambassadors\u201d who would conduct enforcement at first before the Albemarle County Police Department started enforcement, County Executive Jeff Richardson said. Richardson said a vendor hasn\u2019t been selected and he wasn\u2019t sure how much the service will cost. Deputy City Manager Paul Oberdorfer said the city is considering partnering with a vendor and using parks and recreation employees for enforcement. UVa President Jim Ryan sent an email to the board and council on Monday supporting the ordinance, writing that, \u201cWe are putting similar measures into place on Grounds for students, faculty and staff.\u201d Last month, Ryan announced that classes will start on Aug. 25, with reduced class sizes, some lectures online and daily symptom checks. There will be no fall break for 2020 and in-person instruction will end by Thanksgiving, with students not returning to Grounds until after Jan. 1, \u201cto minimize travel and possible transmission of the virus.\u201d UVa hasn\u2019t made any announcements since last month altering its plan for the coming school year. The Charlottesville and Albemarle school boards are both set to vote on school reopening plans during virtual meetings Thursday.","154":"President Trump\u2019s decision to drop prohibitions on international students was right and necessary. The prohibitions should never have been promulgated in the first place. The Trump administration had ordered that if their schools chose to shift to an entirely online schedule, international students would have to transfer to a school that had in-person classes \u2014 or else leave the country entirely. The rule had huge implications for schools such as the University of Virginia, which enrolls many international students, as well as for the individual students who were being targeted. The rule was wrong because it politicized decisions that should not have been political. The implication was that colleges and universities needed to bow to the administration\u2019s view of the COVID-19 pandemic \u2014 and if they did not, they would be punished. The rule was wrong because it federalized decisions that should have belonged to individual schools or to their states. The colleges and universities are best qualified to know what is right for themselves, their communities, and their students, faculty and staff. In states where the higher education system is more centrally managed, such decisions might fall to state officials. The rule was wrong because it disrupted higher education plans and threw students into panic. Colleges and universities that had been carefully designing their opening strategies suddenly had to cope with a new and bizarre variable. Students who had been preparing \u2014 perhaps for years \u2014 to attend school in the U.S. now had their dreams dislocated. We have no idea whether this order from the White House influenced UVa\u2019s decision to open at least some classes on Grounds next month, although it is at least a theoretical possibility. The university is requiring negative COVID-19 tests for returning students. The choice to reopen has been controversial in some quarters, as some local leaders fear that an influx of students might trigger a surge of coronavirus cases. Such fears were heightened recently when students showed up to Midsummers events in Charlottesville and were photographed packed into parties and nightclubs without masking or social distancing. UVa has strongly warned students against such behavior in the future and has hinted it might rethink its decision to re-open classes in person if health and safety can\u2019t be protected. In any case, such decisions should be made by the people closest to the problem \u2014 not mandated from Washington. The rule was not only unnecessary, it was unfair. Good riddance to it.","155":"Across the Thomas Jefferson Health District, the rate declined last week to 6.6% from the previous 7.6%. That\u2019s the good news. But it\u2019s not all good. Some localities continue to see high numbers. What\u2019s more, Central Virginia is not isolated from the rest of the state, nor is Virginia isolated from the rest of the country. COVID pressures from other areas can affect how well we can manage the crisis here. Charlottesville recorded a positivity rate of 7.8% last week, according to the TJHD, while Albemarle\u2019s rate was 7.7%. Both were higher than the state average of 7.5%. Meanwhile, over a five-day period positive cases jumped for those in the 20-29 age range, potentially heightening local concerns over re-opening the University of Virginia. Additionally, as the pandemic drags on, the numbers of deaths and infections \u2014 as opposed to the weekly percentage of positive new tests \u2014 continue to climb. As of July 27, the district had seen 1,648 COVID-19 cases and 30 fatalities. Local government officials have been concerned over another statistical marker \u2014 hospital capacity. The Board of Supervisors heard from the TJHD last week that University of Virginia Health System\u2019s COVID ICU is full, COVID acute care is at 86% capacity, ICU is at 72% capacity and acute care is at 83% capacity. The capacity issue also is, to some degree, affecting Sentara Martha Jefferson, according to District Health Director Denise Bonds. Both UVa and Sentara later pointed out that, overall, hospital census rates have risen not necessarily because of the coronavirus alone but because patients either have begun to feel comfortable with emerging from their homes to seek treatment for other ills \u2014 or have reached a serious stage where treatment no longer can be put off. Patients who delayed non-COVID treatment because of COVID fears became sicker than would otherwise have been the case, and therefore needed to be hospitalized in intensive- or acute-care units. And that\u2019s not all. A major hospital like UVa draws not just from the Thomas Jefferson region but from all over the state and beyond. UVa\u2019s patient census statistics likely do not reflect local infection rates for COVID or any other illness; they are driven by patient intakes from a much larger area. We would not want a hospital with UVa\u2019s stellar expertise to be limited just to local residents. The healing skills and technologies available at UVa \u2014 and Sentara as well \u2014 should be shared with those who need them. But that does raise the question: If UVa ever is at or near capacity treating patients, whether they\u2019re local or reside outside the district, what happens if infection rates surge here? Where would our patients go? We are fortunate to have two excellent hospitals in our midst. But if Sentara were at capacity as well, would local patients then be shuffled to still other hospitals? The cascade effect is not just theoretical, at least not in some parts of the state. In a question-and-answer session before Charlottesville City Council last week, Dr. Bonds noted that the Tidewater area has experienced a surge in COVID cases, stressing capacity at local hospitals. That in turn has affected other hospitals, as they take in patients who cannot be treated closer to home. The overflow even could impact hospitals as far west as our area, she said. A similar cascade of consequences could occur in Central Virginia if COVID cases surged here or nearby. And it\u2019s not just treatment of such cases that\u2019s affected by what happens elsewhere, it\u2019s also testing.","156":"Also important are the capacity to administer an adequate number of COVID tests plus the ability to receive test results back promptly, in order to determine if the people tested actually do have the virus. \u201cWe are seeing a huge, huge problem across the state with testing right now,\u201d Thomas Jefferson Health District Director Denise Bonds told Charlottesville City Council early last week. It\u2019s taking 10 to 14 days to get test results back from commercial labs. That lag time makes the tests almost useless. The lag is due to a combination of factors. As people began re-entering society under Phase Three of the governor\u2019s reopening plan, Virginia generally started to see an increase in cases or suspected cases. Add to that a clear surge of infections in eastern Virginia. Result: More tests began pouring into labs. What\u2019s more, in May and June, Virginia increased its capacity for administering tests, with the aim of detecting more coronavirus cases; now, labs were tasked with reading that increased number of tests. So far, our description of such activity is limited to Virginia. But the picture is bigger than that. Testing occurs among a network of state labs, local hospital labs and national commercial labs. Dr. Bonds told the Council last week that the Thomas Jefferson area is fortunate to have the University of Virginia hospital, which is able to complete some testing. However, she said, UVa had begun to have difficulty obtaining some testing supplies and shortages appear to be redeveloping. TJHD sends its tests to the state lab and as of last week was getting results back in just a few days. But, said Dr. Bonds, another (private) testing site in the Charlottesville area has been waiting up to 10 days for results \u2014 presumably because that provider is using commercial labs. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty pointless,\u201d she said. \u201cIf it\u2019s taking ten days to get a test result back, if you haven\u2019t been staying home that whole time, you\u2019ve been out potentially infecting lots of people. And it\u2019s really difficult for us to do any contact tracing ten days out.\u201d And some states, instead of solely using state labs, also send their tests to the national companies. Because they serve a nationwide clientele, when COVID cases surge in Florida, Texas, Arizona or elsewhere, the commercial labs are overwhelmed with submitted tests. That backs up the entire system \u2014 including any tests submitted by Virginia health professionals. So even though Virginia as a whole might be doing fairly well in keeping the coronavirus under partial control, we can be jeopardized by irresponsible actions in other states. When our tests can\u2019t be processed in a timely manner, people can\u2019t be quickly notified that they\u2019re COVID-positive. They may continue to spread the virus for days. As Dr. Bonds said, if contact tracers can\u2019t get on the case quickly, opportunities may be lost to warn people to self-quarantine or get tested themselves. Who can remember everyone they had contact with in the past two weeks? Odds improve, however, if you\u2019re asked to remember the places you went and people you were in contact with over, say, the past five days. Because contact tracing can be slowed by delay in test results, and delay in test results can result from infection surges far from Virginia, in a sense we are only as strong as our weakest link. We truly are all in this together \u2014 from Central Virginia, to the rest of the commonwealth, to the country as a whole.","157":"RICHMOND\u00a0\u2014 Virginia has avoided the possibility of 800,000 more COVID-19 cases since it started its phased reopening in May, but researchers from the University of Virginia are urging residents to stay vigilant with surges across the state. Most of Virginia entered the state's first reopening phase on May 15, which allowed businesses to reopen with industry-specific restrictions and let places of worship open at 50% capacity. The state has continued its reopening since, with businesses and schools in Phase Three since July 1. With the phased approach, Virginia has avoided potentially 827,377 additional COVID-19 cases, according to updated modeling from UVA. \"We cannot rest on our laurels though,\" researchers from UVA\u2019s Biocomplexity Institute wrote in their weekly update Friday. \"Beating COVID-19 is a marathon, not a sprint. It requires all of us to do our part to stop the spread.\" Nearly one-third (11 of 35) of Virginia's 35 health districts are experiencing surges of COVID-19 cases, seven of them in the Hampton Roads region. Gov. Ralph Northam announced Tuesday new restrictions in Hampton Roads, including a limit on public and private gatherings to 50 people, citing the rise in cases. The rest of the state is limited to 250 people. Just 2.4% of adults in the state have antibodies to COVID-19, indicating that they had the virus at some point, according to preliminary data that the Virginia Department of Health announced Wednesday. \"The big takeaway from this is the overwhelming majority, a very large portion of the population in the commonwealth, is still vulnerable to infection and we must continue to take precautionary measures,\" State Health Commissioner Norman Oliver said Wednesday. September peak? UVA modeling released in May after the state entered Phase One projected that new COVID-19 cases would peak at between 5,000 and 9,300 a day in late July or early August. Modeling unveiled Friday says that on our current course, Virginia will have an expected peak for new weekly cases at 12,926 (and growing) by early September. With a statewide surge that some areas of the state are already experiencing, that number climbs to 15,858. \"People's behavior has maybe relaxed a little bit as the summer season kicked off and people wanted to get closer back to normal,\" said Bryan Lewis, one of the UVA researchers. \"That may have led to increased transmission, certainly in the Tidewater area.\" He added: \"If you have one part of the state that's a little bit hotter than the rest, it's not going to take long before people move between those areas and re-seed (the virus).\" The researchers said in their report last week that cellphone data shows residents in the state are returning to work and visiting businesses \"almost at pre-pandemic levels.\" That's OK, they said, if residents and businesses follow the state's reopening guidance, but warned that not doing so could lead to a rollback of reopening plans, which has happened in other states. Virginia has been under a mask mandate since the end of May, which Madhav Marathe, another UVA researcher, said \"there's no denying\" has helped. \"Adherence is the real key,\" Marathe said. \"It is easy. It is effective.\" Richmond area The Richmond area has already seen its peak for new confirmed cases, with 1,281 per week during the week ending May 17, according to the model, which also showed that the region has avoided potentially 134,763 additional cases since May 15. \"If residents and businesses adhere to good social distancing and infection control practices, new case growth rates may remain low,\" the model, which doesn't stretch into the fall, says. \"Otherwise, cases may peak in the fall.\" Richmond, Northern Virginia and Accomack County delayed entering Phase One on May 15, waiting two weeks longer than other localities to start reopening. Accomack, which is home to two poultry plants, sought a delay after the virus spread in the plants. Poultry plants After initially declining to release data on COVID-19 at poultry plants, the Virginia Department of Health said Thursday that there have been 15 outbreaks in meat and poultry processing facilities across the state. Those outbreaks have led to 1,216 confirmed cases, 48 hospitalizations and 10 deaths, according to the health department. The majority of those cases (720 out of 1,216) were in the state's eastern region, where Accomack's plants are located. \"Initial cases of COVID-19 associated with meat and poultry processing plants were reported in March of 2020. Cases peaked in April and May,\" the agency said. \"Facilities implemented multiple interventions to reduce and prevent viral transmission. Cases have since decreased significantly and only sporadic cases are being reported at this time.\" There have been nine confirmed cases in the plants in July, according to health department data, down from 24 in June and 550 in May.","158":"ROANOKE \u2014 Thousands of Virginia Tech students will now be required to take a COVID-19 test when they start returning to campus in two weeks. Students living in university housing must get a less-invasive \u201cmid-nasal\u201d swab at Lane Stadium during move-in Aug. 14 to Aug. 23. Tech expects students to self-isolate until test results come back within about 48 hours. \u201cIf you do not submit to a test, you will not be allowed to live on campus,\u201d President Tim Sands said Friday at a virtual town hall. \u201cDon\u2019t come thinking you can just say, \u2018I don\u2019t want to do the test.\u2019\u201d Tech will ask those who test positive for the virus to return home and quarantine for 14 days, though students may stay in a university quarantine space if that\u2019s the best option for them, Sands said. University officials emphasized Friday how vital it is that both students living in university housing and students living off-campus confine themselves to their family unit before returning. \u201cI understand the anxiety and the concerns, but if we have 14 days of quarantine before arrival, then I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to have very many of these positive cases,\u201d Sands said. \u201cAssume it\u2019s going to be negative, and if it\u2019s positive, we\u2019ll deal with it.\u201d The revision to Tech\u2019s testing plan \u2014 which previously made testing voluntary for on-campus residents \u2014 comes as the university prepares for thousands of people to travel to Montgomery County, which saw a one-day record of 15 cases reported Monday, but which otherwise remains well below the statewide per capita average. Already this summer, athletes at both Tech and Radford University have tested positive for the coronavirus, Noelle Bissell, director of the New River Health District, told the Montgomery County School Board at a July 21 meeting. \u201cMy best guess would be two to four weeks when Virginia Tech comes back, we\u2019ll start to see cases and outbreaks. Same thing with Radford, two to four weeks,\u201d she said at the meeting, noting that both universities had hundreds of athletes on campuses then. \u201cWe have positive cases amongst the athletes. We are not having major outbreaks,\u201d Bissell said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t made national news that 46 of our football players have COVID. It\u2019s going really well.\u201d In an email last week, Bissell, citing state policies, declined to identify the exact source of an outbreak that health department data says exists at an \u201ceducational setting\u201d in the New River Health District. An outbreak is defined as at least two lab-confirmed cases. Tech has declined repeatedly to release testing data among athletes, unlike the University of Virginia, which has reported that three football players and another athlete have tested positive for COVID-19. A Tech spokesman cited the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, which says personally identifiable information includes \u201cinformation that can be used to distinguish or trace an individual\u2019s identity either directly or indirectly through linkages with other information.\u201d A UVa spokesman said, \u201cour position is the information we\u2019ve provided, which does not include personally identifiable health or student information, is permissible under federal privacy laws.\u201d A U.S. Department of Education spokeswoman said Friday that the FERPA office was \u201cslammed with other media inquiries,\u201d and referred a reporter to a coronavirus FAQ cited by the Tech spokesman. On Friday, Sands said the university would be assembling a public dashboard, composed of data from the health department to keep the community informed. Contact tracers from the health department will be in direct communication with people if they may have been exposed to someone who tests positive for COVID-19. \u201cYou can think of it as no news is good news,\u201d said Laura Hungerford, head of the Department of Population Health Sciences at Virginia-Maryland College of Veterinary Medicine. Though Friday\u2019s town hall focused on Tech\u2019s testing and contact-tracing plan, Sands said the first line of defense is for everyone to wear masks, maintain at least a six-foot distance, wash hands frequently and self-isolate when ill. \u201cIf we all did this all of the time we would knock SARS-CoV-2 to the ground. It\u2019s really that simple,\u201d Sands said. \u201cBut we know we are humans, and as humans we need to be around others and we need to have time to relax without all those constraints.\u201d That\u2019s why Sands and Hungerford encouraged students to \u201cidentify your pod\u201d \u2014 a group of roughly four to 14 peers \u2014 that can interact casually and agree not to hang out with outsiders, unless masks and physical distancing are involved. \u201cWe do need our students to hold up your end of the bargain. We\u2019re going to provide all the support we can, but the university can\u2019t do this alone,\u201d Sands said. \u201cIf I were to put this very simply, it means no big parties or late nights in crowded bars and restaurants. There\u2019s just no way to make a crowded indoor space safe without masks and distancing.\u201d If community members don\u2019t follow public health guidelines and cases tick up, Sands added, \u201cI am concerned that we will have to step back from our plans and go remote again.\u201d A link to the university\u2019s testing plan, and other updates, can be found at vt.edu\/ready.","159":"University of Virginia officials will open up Grounds to students later this month with a set of rules, protocols, a contact tracing cellphone app and a student-signed contract that they hope will allow classes to commence and continue despite the COVID-19 pandemic. The university\u2019s Board of Visitors met Friday afternoon mostly behind closed doors to review the school\u2019s detailed pandemic response plans, including testing for the virus, public health and safety issues on grounds and liability issues. The private meeting also included proprietary and business-related information about the UVa Medical Center\u2019s preparations for testing and clinical response, according to a prepared motion to go into executive session. Rector James B. Murray said the pandemic will put to the test the reputation of UVa\u2019s history of student self-governance. \u201cI think we have as well conceived of a plan as any in America, but we have to be clear. This boils down to whether or not we have compliance,\u201d Murray told the board in a virtual meeting. \u201cThe pandemic is going to be the ultimate test of our students.\u201d Murray said the university\u2019s tradition and history of student self-governance will be tested by whether students adhere to the protocols in place when returning to classes. \u201cIf we live up to our history, live up to our traditions then the plans we devise are going to work,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we can enforce these standards among ourselves, we will succeed.\u201d Murray curated questions from board members and led off the meeting by asking UVa staff to address concerns held by multiple BOV members. According to staff, it is up to students to self-identify any medical risks they may have and to either choose online classes or a hybrid class schedule to more safely attend classes. Students living in on-grounds housing will have isolation and quarantine quarters provided by the university but those living off grounds will need to arrange their own, staff said. \u201cWhat we have done, because we can\u2019t quarantine them, is have them think through it with their families and their roommates,\u201d said Patricia Lampkin, vice president and chief of student affairs. \u201cThe [Virginia Department of Health] will work on that with [off grounds students] as they do with any other citizen.\u201d Officials are also hoping students will download a contract tracing application to the cellphones developed by Google and Apple and in use in other parts of the world. The app is being deployed by the health department and will be integrated into the UVa student app on Aug. 10. Those apps will allow cell phones to communicate to each other via Bluetooth when students are in close proximity to each and record an anonymous list of those with whom a student comes in contact. If a student tests positive for COVID-19, that student would enter the test result into the app and that phone would text all of the phones in the app memory with which the student had been in proximity. Identities of those with whom a student had contact, and even the student who tested positive, would be kept confidential, according to information provided about the app. \u201cIt could well be the most important thing we do technologically,\u201d Murray said. \u201cThere is no way we\u2019re going to catch cases more quickly than this software can enable.\u201d Murray said that while the app will not prevent the COVID-19 spread, it can help contain it by identifying quickly who has come in contact with a carrier. \u201cI would love to see it in the hands of merchants and people who work around and in close contact with university students and faculty,\u201d Murray said. \u201cIf we could it in the hands of those most in close contact with UVa students, like bartenders and grocery store clerks, we could go a long way to catching the virus quickly.\u201d Undergraduate courses begin Aug. 25 and in-person instruction will conclude by Thanksgiving. Students will not return for the spring semester until after the new year. Students must submit to the university a negative test result for COVID-19 before returning and are asked to self-quarantine for 14 days prior to returning. Students who test positive may not return to school and will be asked to self-isolate at home, consult a local health care provider immediately. They may return 10 days after the date of a positive test or development of symptoms and a mandatory self-isolation. During the school year, students will need to take a daily health check of possible symptoms and wear face masks in buildings or on university property when others are around or on a university transit bus. If students fail to follow the rules and the virus breaks out on grounds, officials said they have several options. \u201cWe\u2019ve been contingency planning since March and have a variety of provisions,\u201d said Jennifer Davis, executive vice president and chief operating officer of the university. \u201cWe have the ability to do things like shelter in place, if we need to, and modify some aspects of our operations both in terms of academics and [daily operations.]\u201d Davis said officials could place restrictions on interpersonal interactions and could send some students home, providing it was safe to do so. \u201cLastly, we could also go back to only essential operations,\u201d Davis said. \u201cWe have multiple contingency plans and we continue to work on them.\u201d","160":"Spending time in the bed of an intensive care unit can leave its mark on a patient, and for those afflicted with COVID-19, studies show it can be even worse. That\u2019s why a small cadre of medical care providers at the University of Virginia Medical Center is following up with patients who spent time in the pandemic ICU once they go home. \u201cThe studies show that once you get out of the ICU, that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re really out of trouble,\u201d said Dr. Alexandra Kadl, assistant professor of medicine and pharmacology at UVa\u2019s School of Medical and the clinic\u2019s supervisor. \u201cWhen patients are on respirators, many times the lung function doesn\u2019t return to normal or there are other long-term issues that cause problems,\u201d she said. \u201cThere aren\u2019t many places that follow their patients post-release, and we thought, \u2018how about we bring them back and see how they\u2019re doing?\u2019\u201d According to studies collected by the National Institutes of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, patients in any intensive care unit \u2014 be it cardiac, trauma or medical \u2014 can develop persistent problems. Studies of patients from the 2003 SARS epidemic, which was caused by a coronavirus, showed that the virus\u2019 impacts lasted at least six months after recovery for nearly a third of patients, with 16% having significant lung impairment. Studies with COVID-19 patients in other states show that the virus causing the pandemic also can affect cardiovascular health, kidney health and even mental health. The virus leaves even the healthy patients who contract it physically exhausted for a period of weeks, studies show. With all of the possible problems, the UVa team created the post-COVID clinic to see how patients are faring post-release. \u201cIt\u2019s not just lung function \u2014 they have a difficult time going back to work and having their daily life because the virus has such impact,\u201d said Dr. Chintan Ramani, clinical fellow in pulmonary and critical care at the Medical Center. \u201cThat\u2019s why we started the clinic \u2014 to know what the impacts are on our patients and to help them recover.\u201d There are a few similar clinics around. Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City runs one and other large teaching hospitals are developing similar clinics. The process seems simple. Once a patient is released from ICU and the hospital, Ramani contacts them to ask them to participate in the clinic. Appointments are made and the patients are checked for lung health, heart health and general health. It\u2019s not all that easy, however. Many of the hospital\u2019s dozens of coronavirus patients treated early in the pandemic live outside of the area, many in Northern Virginia. Many also do not speak English as a first language, making communication difficult at times. The phone calls and scheduling fall on Ramani\u2019s shoulders, with help from Norma Nelson, a registered nurse with the clinic. \u201cI figured we\u2019d have maybe 10 or 12 who agreed to participate but we have nearly 40,\u201d Ramani said. The clinicians are especially concerned about lung issues. The CDC cites medical protocols that patients on respirators take sedatives to help them deal with the intrusive intubation tube that pushes air in and out of their lungs. Because the sedation may cause nightmares or hallucinations in some patients, many also take paralytic drugs to keep their reflexes from fighting the ventilator\u2019s tube. A pre-COVID study in 2013 of ICU patients needing respirators showed most patients on the machines for about three days could suffer weakness, memory loss, anxiety, depression and hallucinations after treatment. The study also showed many had difficulty sleeping, walking and talking and exhibited signs of post-traumatic stress disorder. For COVID-19 patients, that has been made worse by the oftentimes need to be on the machines for as long as eight days, according to studies from the CDC. So far, UVa patients in the clinic seem to have escaped those conditions, clinicians said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had almost all of our patients from the COVID ICU come back,\u201d said Kadl. \u201cWe assess them for physical changes and we assess them for post-traumatic stress disorder, which really doesn\u2019t seem to be an issue.\u201d Kadl said the UVa patients are doing \u201camazingly well.\u201d \u201cMost of them have fairly good, normal lung functions and are returning to normal living,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s still early in the recovery process so we want to see how they do long-term.\u201d The clinic staff is compiling results and statistics for research on why the outcomes are so good. Studies in other areas of the country show more difficulty in patient recovery, and Kadl said it\u2019s possible that the difference in outcomes comes down to the difference in treatment. Kadl noted that UVa has not been hard-pressed like some hospitals. It\u2019s seen fewer deaths among COVID-19 patients than many hospitals in other areas of the state and country. \u201cUnlike New York or other places, Charlottesville was not overrun. We haven\u2019t had a shortage of beds or caregivers who had so many patients they couldn\u2019t spend some time with one individually,\u201d she said. \u201cDoes that contribute to a better outcome? We\u2019d have to say yes. If you have enough equipment and personnel to treat patients and you do not have to decide which patient to treat, as they\u2019ve done in some hard-hit areas, that\u2019s going to translate into better patient outcomes,\u201d she said.","161":"Ryan and UVa\u2019s Board of Visitors are highly educated people who take their responsibilities to the university, Charlottesville, Albemarle County and surrounding areas seriously. So how can their decision to bring in thousands of potential COVID-carriers this month from all over the country, and internationally, be anything but very troubling to those of us who live here? I\u2019ve read their reasoning, and that of their colleagues. None of it makes any sense when they have the best solution of all at this stage of the pandemic: Remote classes until the virus is under control. And especially unnerving is to see the front-page headline and story in The Daily Progress on Aug. 1 stating \u201cCOVID prevention to rely on student self-governance.\u201d Really? Rely on thousands of twenty-somethings to all do the right thing and not congregate in groups, partying and drinking at frat houses and elsewhere all around the area? And if they do congregate, to do so in small groups with face coverings and social distancing? Ryan and company actually believe that would happen?\u00a0 Inevitably, we can expect a surge in transmissions, cases and hospitalizations. Even more frightening, the possibility of increased deaths.\u00a0 Adding thousands from outside our area all at once is truly a recipe for disaster. This pandemic is getting worse. Please, for all our sakes, young and old, the university should reconsider and reverse its course, as so many other schools, colleges and universities are doing. It\u2019s the right thing to do.\u00a0 Ed Cusick Albemarle County","162":"I disagree with my fellow Wahoo that Charlottesville Mayor Nikuyah Walker\u2019s comments about the university reopening plans are \u201cunnecessarily pessimistic.\u201d I believe she is being a realist. The reality is that the COVID-19 pandemic is more prevalent now than it was last March when the university suspended in-person instruction. Any progress that had been made with the initial shutdowns and travel restrictions has been erased by the recent resurgence. This resurgence has largely been driven by younger Americans not taking safety precautions seriously. Just a few weeks ago, images and videos of packed bars and fraternity houses circulated on social media during Midsummers. I believe Mayor Walker is very concerned that those scenes could recur, just with thousands more students around to join in. The university has access to federal CARES Act money and an endowment worth billions to care for its students. The Charlottesville community has a poverty rate of 23% and an uninsured rate of around 10.4%. While a young UVa student likely has good health insurance and resources to recover from COVID-19, many Charlottesville residents do not. If university students return and cause a large outbreak, it will likely lead Gov. Ralph Northam to issue another executive order shutting down businesses once again. Nothing is more harmful to economic prosperity than the continued uncontained spread of COVID-19. Experiencing cabin fever is far less traumatic than contracting COVID-19 without having health insurance, exposing yourself every day as a front-line worker, or experiencing job loss due to the economic downturn. There is nothing more I want than to start the school year celebrating and catching up with friends like I have been able to do the past three years, but I know this year that cannot and should not happen. The pandemic demands that we all \u2014 especially the young, mostly privileged UVa students \u2014 make sacrifices and exert selflessness, empathy, and compassion for our fellow citizens.

UVa leaders announced the change Tuesday in an email that also cited supply chain disruptions that have affected the availability of testing materials. The decision comes after elected officials and community members have criticized the decision to bring students back. Students were slated to move in Aug. 18 and start in-person classes on Aug. 25. Instead, online classes will begin Aug. 25 and in-person instruction for undergraduates will begin Sept. 8, the same day that thousands of students in the Charlottesville and Albemarle school divisions will start the academic year virtually. The delay will allow officials to track the progression of the virus and ensure adequate testing capacity throughout the semester, as well as make sure health and safety protocols put in place are continuing to work. Most UVa students live off Grounds, and university leaders urged those students to delay their return, as well. Graduate and professional programs will start as previously planned. Several other universities across the country have reversed plans to hold in-person classes as the virus continues to spread unabated. Within the Thomas Jefferson Health District, July was the worst month of the pandemic as deaths and hospitalizations spiked and cases climbed at a much faster rate than the previous two months. Tuesday\u2019s letter to the UVa community was signed by President Jim Ryan, Provost Liz Magill, Executive Vice President for Health Affairs Dr. K. Craig Kent and Chief Operating Officer J.J. Davis. \u201cIn response to these conditions, and based on the advice of UVa public health experts, we have decided to adopt a phased approach to the fall semester, which we believe will best safeguard the health and safety of our university community and our Charlottesville neighbors and give us the best chance of a successful return to Grounds,\u201d they wrote. \u201cWe still plan to welcome all students back to Grounds, but out of caution, we will do it a bit more slowly than originally intended.\u201d UVa spokesman Brian Coy said officials are monitoring specific metrics and will provide additional details on their approach in the next couple of days. University leaders will hold a virtual town hall Friday for students, faculty and staff, according to the email. Similar virtual gatherings for parents and Charlottesville community members will be held next week. UVa leaders wrote that they will continue to track closely key criteria such as viral prevalence rates, hospital capacity, compliance with health and safety measures and the availability of testing materials necessary for fall reopening plans. \u201cIf we need to change plans again due to the progression of the virus, the guidance of our public health experts, or guidelines from the Virginia Department of Health, we will,\u201d they wrote. \u201cFor now, we believe that this is the best plan to pursue in the face of the information we have, and we are optimistic that it will enable us to have a safe and productive semester on Grounds.\u201d All students are required to submit a negative COVID-19 test and quarantine for 14 days before returning to the Charlottesville area, one of several measures in UVa\u2019s health and safety plan. UVa has contracted with Let\u2019s Get Checked to test all students. With offices in New York City and Dublin, the company makes its own kits and tests the samples. On Monday, students posted on Twitter about challenges requesting and receiving the kits. When UVa officials detailed the initial reopening plan in June, they said the plans were subject to change based on the progression of the virus and the university\u2019s ability to respond. University officials said at last week\u2019s Board of Visitors meeting that the plan hinged on student self-governance. Charlottesville and Albemarle officials have roundly criticized the decision to have in-person classes, fearing that the return of thousands of students from across the country and world would spur more community spread of the virus. \u201cUVa students should not return,\u201d Charlottesville School Board Chairwoman Jennifer McKeever said last week. \u201cThey should not be coming back into our community from all over the world to hurt our community. The UVa thing is what keeps me up at night. I could probably protect a classroom. I might be able to protect the school. But with UVa students coming in from all over the world, I can\u2019t see how we can protect our community from that.\u201d Officials became particularly alarmed after students returned in early July for traditional mid-summers parties and were documented on social media gathering in large groups without masks. Allen Groves, dean of students at UVa, condemned the gatherings in an email to students shortly thereafter. \u201cPlease recommit to observing social distancing and wearing masks when in the company of others with whom you do not share a home,\u201d he wrote. \u201cFailure to do so places the most vulnerable at significant risk and will likely lead to an end to on-Grounds education this fall.\u201d UVa will work to accommodate students in extenuating circumstances who need to return to Grounds as originally planned with alternate housing arrangements for the two-week delay. International students planning to attend in person should plan to arrive in the United States by Aug. 25 in order to comply with quarantine and immigration requirements, according to the announcement. The letter also noted positive signs, including that university has resumed research activity that stopped in the spring, started some graduate and professional programs in-person and brought back some student-athletes for preseason training. \u201cThese early steps have shown that, by following proper precautions, we can resume in-person activity safely,\u201d officials wrote.","164":null,"165":"Many in Charlottesville let go a sigh of relief after the University of Virginia announced it would delay for two weeks the start of in-person classes for undergraduates. And many probably hope that the delay is preparatory to canceling, not just postponing, on-Grounds courses. If students really want to return to UVa and Charlottesville, then they damaged their own cause when many of them appeared at recent Midsummers gatherings without masks and without social distancing. That display of irresponsibility set up a wave of alarm in Charlottesville and Albemarle County. The pending all-at-once influx of some 17,000 students, a portion of whom had already demonstrated lack of concern for the community\u2019s health and safety, raised the specter that Charlottesville-Albemarle could experience a resulting surge in the deadly coronavirus. The UVa Board of Visitors didn\u2019t help when it said the re-opening plan would be a test of students\u2019 ability to self-govern by observing COVID-19 protocols. Self-governance is an honored tradition at UVa \u2014 but not always perfectly practiced, as Midsummers proved. To be fair, the university has tried to come up with ways to ensure safety. For one thing, it is requiring students to produce a negative COVID-19 test and to quarantine for 14 days before returning to the Charlottesville area. UVa had contracted with a private company. Some students had said on social media that they were having trouble in both requesting and receiving those tests.\u00a0UVa later said those disruptions were extremely brief in nature, and that testing was proceeding smoothly. UVa had cited supply chain disruptions in testing materials as one of its reasons for delaying in-person classes. Those disruptions applied to local hospitals, a UVa spokesman said, which is why the university went to a private company for student testing.\u00a0 A negative test and a 14-day quarantine are good requirements for minimizing the potential of a COVID outbreak. But they don\u2019t address the possibility of students becoming infected after arrival \u2014 or before arrival, for that matter, because they failed to obey quarantine \u2014 and then spreading the virus through the high-density campus and city environment. In addition to testing availability and student compliance with requirements, UVa says it will monitor other metrics \u2014 including infection rates and hospital capacity. Infection rates already have jumped following the easing of restrictions on public gatherings across the state and nation in recent weeks. We wonder how much hardship it might impose on students themselves if they are allowed back \u2014 but then are abruptly told to leave town, as occurred last spring, if COVID cases surge. Undergraduates were slated to return on Aug. 18 for classes beginning Aug. 25. Online classes still will begin on that date, but in-person classes are pushed to Sept. 8. Students who live off-Grounds are encouraged to delay their move back to Charlottesville as well. The announcement was made on Aug. 4. That didn\u2019t give students much time to pivot \u2014 but, then, nothing about this pandemic has allowed for predictability. The delay could be particularly hard on international students, for whom plans to return are complicated by visa requirements, airline schedules and other factors. UVa is making arrangements to house any students who face hardships in revising their plans. No matter how you parse it, both the original plans and the revised plans impose some kind of burden on someone. But even though yet another change of plans would cause some hardships, UVa officials must be ready to make that move should re-opening cause increased danger to students, staff, faculty \u2014 or the community at large.","166":"University of Virginia students and organizations that repeatedly don\u2019t comply with the school\u2019s rules for masking and social distancing could face suspension and other penalties, officials said in a virtual town hall meeting on Friday. The university will also test wastewater from residences and other buildings to determine if there is someone who may be asymptomatic with the virus but possibly communicable. The session was held for faculty, staff and others interested in the planning behind students and employees returning to grounds for fall semester. It touched on a variety of topics from returning funds for housing and food paid by students to classroom sizes. University Counsel Tim Heaphy said the school\u2019s requirements that students wear masks is enforceable on and off grounds and repeated offenses could result in suspensions and other sanctions through the university. \u201cFirst, it\u2019s important to realize that the university standards of conduct apply beyond the physical space owned and controlled by the university,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat that means is it isn\u2019t as if you can take off your mask when you cross off of university property or have a big party off grounds. Those matters are covered if they\u2019re in Charlottesville and Albemarle County by the obligations that we are imposing.\u201d Heaphy said the idea is that students will be admonished by peers to follow the guidelines and that masks, social distancing and other requirements will become a part of the school norm. \u201cIf someone isn\u2019t wearing a mask, our hope is that they will be reminded of that by a peer, by another student or a faculty member or staff and that there\u2019ll be compliance,\u201d he said. \u201cOver time, everyone starts to understand and take as normal adherence to those rules. If there\u2019s refusal to comply, if there are repeated violations or very serious ones, those are the issues where we will address with enforcement.\u201d UVa President Jim Ryan said school officials hope a mix of online courses and in-person classes will be able to accommodate most students and faculty. He said the mix of classes is important to provide the educational, social and community interactions integral to college education. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to be fully online unless we have to and at the same time we don\u2019t want to bring all of the students back on grounds unless we can do so safely,\u201d Ryan said. On Thursday, Ryan announced that the school would delay opening by two weeks in the face of an increasing number of positive COVID-19 test results in the Charlottesville area and the state. Classes are now slated to start online on Aug. 25 with in-person instruction for undergraduates beginning Sept. 8. Graduate and professional programs will start as previously planned. Students will need to submit a negative COVID-19 test taken within seven days of their planned move-in dates. They will be allowed to move into residence halls a few days prior to the beginning of classes. \u201cOur decision to take a phased approach to opening is not universally popular and has caused some frustration. Some are wondering why we don\u2019t just decide now that we\u2019re going to be online all semester,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cOthers are wondering why we\u2019re delaying at all. It might help to start with the basic question of why we\u2019re even trying to bring back students.\u201d Ryan said the university\u2019s mission is \u201cto educate students, conduct research and provide medical care.\u201d \u201cAll of those are better done in person and students are involved in each part of that mission,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why, from the very beginning, we\u2019ve talked to have students returned to grounds as long as we could do so in a reasonably safe manner.\u201d Ryan said that being on grounds for some students is the safest place to be. He said other students face challenges learning online from home and that some university employees and contract workers have jobs that depend on students being on grounds. \u201cWe also know that roughly two thirds of our students live off grounds and outside of the university housing, which means that thousands of students are going to be living in Charlottesville,\u201d he said. \u201cOur view is it will be better for everyone if these students feel like they\u2019re a part of the university community rather than outside of it.\u201d Health system officials said they believe they have the resources to adequately test the university community and treat any cases that may develop. One way officials hope to head off an outbreak is by monitoring the sewers in some university residences and buildings. Genetic material of the virus is present in human waste, said Dr. Costi Sifri, director of hospital epidemiology. \u201cThe concept of wastewater testing is essentially to test the wastewater that\u2019s coming from a building,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re hopeful to use this as a way to identify as an early warning sign that there may be people within the community in a building or in a dorm.\u201d Ryan said that school officials are prepared to admit defeat and close in-person instruction, if need be. \u201cIf we have to change course we will,\u201d he said. \u201cIf nothing else, it\u2019s clear that we have to approach this virus with humility and retain a willingness to adapt to circumstances.\u201d","167":"Ahead of the return of University of Virginia students, Central Virginia is on track for another record month of coronavirus cases as health officials say residents continue to flout social distancing recommendations. The first seven days of August have seen 189 new cases of the coronavirus in the Thomas Jefferson Health District, roughly 38% more than the record set in the first week of July. The district covers Charlottesville and Albemarle, Fluvanna, Nelson, Greene and Louisa counties. Overall, there have been 1,894 cases, 141 hospitalizations and 44 deaths. \u201cWe are seeing quite a bit of parties,\u201d said Jessica Coughlin, the health department\u2019s emergency coordinator. \u201cIt\u2019s a long time to be away from friends and away from family. I think it\u2019s a frustration level. It\u2019s summer and people want to get outside before fall.\u201d Coughlin said the percent-positivity rate of tests, or the percent of tests that return positive for the virus, has trended downward, but is continually in fluctuation. The latest rate for the district was 5.6% on Monday compared to 7.3% in the state. According to the World Health Organization, an indicator that the pandemic is beginning to be controlled is a percent positivity rate below 5% for a period of at least two weeks. The district has had a rate below 5% for a total of 24 days since the first positive case was reported on March 17. In the district, the rate was last below 5% from June 12 to June 16. It also was below 5% from May 10 to May 16, May 6 to May 8, April 27 to April 28 and March 18 to March 24. As of Friday, there were 20 outbreaks in the district, with 360 outbreak-associated cases and 146 cases among health care workers. The case trends caused UVa to announce that it would delay in-person classes to Sept. 8 and delay move-in day for undergraduates, although those who live off Grounds are already starting to return to the area. \u201cI think that we\u2019re still in this place of limbo where we\u2019re seeing where the numbers are going,\u201d Coughlin said. This week, Virginia rolled out its COVIDWISE app to help people better understand potential exposure to the virus. The app allows phones to exchange Bluetooth signals with other phones that have the app to keep an anonymous list of close encounters. The app then allows those who catch the virus to notify people who may have been contacted without revealing their identity. Coughlin said the app could help residents see the virus\u2019s prevalence. \u201cIt may have them think twice before taking any unnecessary trips,\u201d she said. If people receive a positive test, the district will still conduct its own contact tracing, but the app will still help residents determine if they\u2019ve been exposed. Coughlin said exposure only counts for 15 minutes within six feet. \u201cIf you run by someone on the street, you\u2019re not going to be at risk,\u201d she said. The health district will start changing some of its testing guidelines with new guidance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The new guidelines say that health officials should not conduct another test of someone who tested positive for three months after getting the results of their initial test. To determine if someone is free of the virus, the guidelines instead focus on symptoms rather than a negative test. Coughlin said that means 10 days must have passed since symptoms started, 24 hours must have passed since a fever and other symptoms must have improved. The new guidelines help save tests for those who might need them, Coughlin said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been having a lot of people coming multiple times,\u201d she said. \u201cSome have wanted to come multiple times in one week and it\u2019s really just not the best way to use these tests.\u201d For more information on upcoming testing events, visit vdh.virginia.gov\/thomas-jefferson\/covid-19-testing-sites.","168":"UVa Health and the Virginia Department of Health have worked together to create a testing schedule that will allow more people from Charlottesville and the surrounding region to access COVID-19 testing.

Medical staff in the new Acute Care Special Pathogens Unit, known around the hospital as SPU, say the last four months have been the absolute dickens, simultaneously the best and the worst of times. It started in March with a sense of fear and worry mixed with excitement and dedication as the virulent virus struck New York City and western states with a vengeance. As the virus crept closer, Virginia shut down and the intensive and acute care teams cranked up. \u201cIt\u2019s been a ride,\u201d said Kendall Barger, a registered nurse in the unit. \u201cIt started out as some virus on the other side of the world and suddenly it was here. We had prepared and trained for Ebola so we knew a lot about the procedures and we were ready to go.\u201d As the virus approached, UVa administrators paved the way for the new COVID acute care unit and ICU, finishing up a new addition for use and clearing space in a medical ward in case of a crushing caseload. \u201cIn just a matter of 24 hours, the medical environment and situation on the entire third floor of the Medical Center changed overnight,\u201d said Dr. Paul Helgerson, of the SPU. \u201cWe really didn\u2019t know what to expect when the virus hit us. We started out knowing very little. We\u2019ve learned a lot as we\u2019ve progressed.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve probably been through 80 million emotions,\u201d said SPU team member Meredith Farmer, a registered nurse. \u201cIn the beginning, we realized this was history and it will be cool to tell our children and grandchildren that we were on the frontlines in fighting the pandemic. But it was also scary because there was so much we didn\u2019t know.\u201d In March, researchers were unsure exactly how the virus was transmitted. They didn\u2019t know the disease\u2019s progression or its side effects. They weren\u2019t sure if standard-issue personal protective equipment \u2014 medical masks, gowns and gloves \u2014 would be enough to protect the staff and their families. \u201cIt\u2019s a challenge to continuously adapt and take care of patients without important information,\u201d said Dr. Kyle Enfield, of the SPU. \u201cThis is a new virus and we didn\u2019t know what was going to work in terms of PPE. We didn\u2019t know how or if we would be overwhelmed.\u201d \u201cIt was hard seeing the uncertainty in my teammates,\u201d Barger said. \u201cWe\u2019re very close and work well together and we\u2019re good friends. We didn\u2019t know whether we were going to get sick, whether we were going to bring the virus home to people we loved, or if we\u2019d have to isolate ourselves. It was hard.\u201d Perhaps the hardest thing for the SPU teams was discovering that the virus could devastate whole families and put patients on respirators for weeks, which requires heavy sedation and sometimes paralytic drugs. They also discovered the virus can keep some patients in intensive care for a month and can cause those getting better to suddenly take a turn for the worse. \u201cOnce folks get sick, we see a two-week course of illness of high acuity,\u201d Helgerson said. \u201cOn the more critical side, some patients develop acute respiratory distress syndrome that depresses their oxygen level and they may be on a ventilator for two weeks. That was a big change because, in the medical ICU, you might have a patient on a ventilator for two or three days.\u201d They knew the virus assaults the lungs, but they found it is also tough on the circulatory system, causing problems in the bloodstream by increasing clotting. \u201cPatients in the latter decades of life have a much higher mortality rate, but it can be severe in any decade of life,\u201d Helgerson said. \u201cIt can be a bit of everything. There are some people who have almost no symptoms at all and there are people who are in between.\u201d The virus can infect entire families at the same time. \u201cThat\u2019s the worst, when we see whole families come in,\u201d Enfield said. \u201cThe staff shares that experience. They see everyone sick at the same time. They see that some family members don\u2019t know that their father or mother is down the hall and maybe dying because they\u2019re so sick themselves that they need sedation. It\u2019s hard. You see younger staff members taking care of people their own age and you can tell they suddenly see their own mortality.\u201d \u201cTo see people suffer without their loved ones is hard,\u201d Farmer said. \u201cSometimes you\u2019ll have a patient doing really well and they look like they\u2019re ready to go home and then suddenly they get worse. It can be like an elevator where one minute you feel less bad and then better and then you\u2019re a lot worse. Some people come in feeling good and then they decline fast.\u201d v v v The severity of the illness and intensity of care can create bonds between staff and patients, even if the patient is on a ventilator and under sedation. \u201cWhen you\u2019ve been doing this for four months, it becomes the thing you think about at home. It\u2019s what you dream about,\u201d Barger said. \u201cICU nurses deal with death on a regular basis, but people dying alone is challenging to watch. It\u2019s not the death you hope for people. It\u2019s hard on their families, too, because people can\u2019t be there with their loved one.\u201d For Barger, one of the hardest parts of the SPU is when that special patient is failing. \u201cIt\u2019s hard when you get attached to a patient and you know the end game is not good,\u201d she said. Just as there are defeats, there are victories. A patient\u2019s poor prognosis turning into recovery is reason enough to celebrate like a wide receiver in the Super Bowl\u2019s end zone. \u201cWe had a patient who had a long stay with us and had to go the ICU and come back to the acute care unit. After lots of struggling, getting worse and then better, he was finally well enough to have a visitor for an hour and then finally transfer to a rehab center,\u201d Farmer recalled. \u201cTo see that is such a lift and a feeling of hope. It\u2019s amazing.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s great the first day they can sit up or the first day they can stand up after being in the bed for weeks,\u201d Barger said. \u201cThat\u2019s a great feeling and you feel it with them.\u201d The SPU crews work differently than they did as a medical ICU unit. Before the virus, the team would often rush into a patient\u2019s room to assist a coworker with a procedure and drop in every few minutes to check on medicine or vital signs. With COVID, the rooms are closed. Every entry requires donning of protective gear, which can take about three minutes or more. Every exit requires the doffing of the equipment. That required nurses, doctors and other staff members to change their work flow and procedures. \u201cWe\u2019re type A people and function in an emergency at a fast pace. We keep it together because the unexpected is what we expect, but this changes the ways we do things,\u201d Barger said. \u201cICU is normally a fast-moving pace but with the PPE, you have to change how you approach care. You spend a lot more time in a room and do a variety of things in the same visit to save gear and time. You also know that if you need help, it\u2019s going to take a few minutes for your colleague to suit up and give you a hand.\u201d v v v For the SPU members, their teammates make a big difference. They share the same fears, the same dangers, the same wins, losses and emotions. They work together to find answers to unexpected problems. The really hard days are when I know that many of my coworkers are having a rough time,\u201d Barger said. \u201cThey come in day in and day out and put aside whatever is affecting them and work to find creative ways to address new problems. They\u2019re amazing.\u201d One problem was that the tiny displays on important patient monitors required multiple trips into a patient\u2019s room for readings, with each trip requiring a change of protective gear. One team member brought in binoculars to read the monitors from afar. In another situation, the crew purchased monitors from an electronics store and hooked them up so the displays could be read from outside the room. \u201cYou\u2019re always talking with each other, working together, and it creates a sense of camaraderie,\u201d said Farmer. \u201cThere\u2019s a sense of validation. You come in and ask, \u2018are you OK? I\u2019m not OK,\u2019 and they\u2019re there for you like you\u2019re there for them. That means a lot.\u201d \u201cI really can\u2019t say enough about what the staff has done, especially in the ICU,\u201d Helgerson said. \u201cI\u2019m confident patients are getting the best of care. It\u2019s strained resources and our people are tired but they see we\u2019re gaining ground and they\u2019re committed. That takes a special person.\u201d \u201cThe work is hard from an emotional standpoint and from a work standpoint, but one of the things that keeps you going and makes you feel good about what you\u2019re doing is the support of your coworkers,\u201d Barger said. v v v The SPU crews say they know the virus will be around a while and they will have to keep up the fight. \u201cWearing masks, keeping social distance wilI help keep us from being overwhelmed. We\u2019ve seen how that works here in the unit,\u201d Helgerson said. \u201cOriginally, we wanted to flatten the curve, but it\u2019s pretty clear that all of the long-term solutions are likely to be a ways off. It\u2019s going to be a part of our reality that we need to be prepared to keep up with it.\u201d \u201cThere are a lot of people on this unit, from environmental services to assistants and administrators, who don\u2019t get the recognition they deserve. It takes a lot of people to make the unit work and it\u2019s a strong group,\u201d Enfield said. \u201cBut I think we all long for the days when we can have a meeting with masks off and see everyone\u2019s face and not just their eyes and a part of their forehead.\u201d","170":"ROANOKE \u2014 Two days before students at the University of Virginia\u2019s College at Wise were to begin arriving on campus, the college announced it would delay classes by two weeks. And another surprise: All students would get at-home COVID-19 test kits before returning. While the college\u2019s parent University of Virginia promised tests for its Charlottesville students back in July, the announcement Aug. 3 was the first time roughly 1,400 UVa-Wise students learned they, too, would be required to test negative for COVID-19 before arriving on campus. Some students see the news as another example of inequality between the two schools that the pandemic has exacerbated. \u201cWe are never getting the same treatment, especially with this COVID,\u201d said Weston Allen, a 24-year-old senior from Blacksburg. \u201cPardon the language,\u201d Allen prefaced before quoting one of his professors who had declared UVa-Wise to be the \u201cbastard child\u201d of UVa. \u201cThey always get the first stuff and it\u2019s never extended to the satellite campus,\u201d Allen said. \u201cIt\u2019s always delayed.\u201d Kathy Still, a spokeswoman for the college, said the school didn\u2019t initially require student testing based on guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and on \u201cthe low positivity rates in the region,\u201d when UVa-Wise\u2019s reopening plan was submitted July 6 to the state. But at that time, Wise County had a slightly higher per capita rate of cases than did the city of Radford, where Radford University in its July reopening plan mandated tests for hundreds of on-campus students. State data shows cases in Wise County increasing steadily since about early July. According to the Virginia Department of Health, as of Saturday, Wise County had a rate of 332 cases per 100,000 people, compared with 278 for Radford and 304 for Montgomery County, home of Virginia Tech. \u201cThe college has monitored the data since the start of the pandemic. There was not a single aspect of the data that led to our decision,\u201d Still said in an email about last week\u2019s announcement about testing and the delayed start. \u201cWe relied and still rely on the VDH and the LENOWISCO Health District to guide us on metrics. We are in nearly constant contact with the director of the LENOWISCO Health District on all local COVID 19 matters,\u201d she said. \u201cI cannot speak to any decisions made by Radford.\u201d Still cited CDC guidance, which does not recommend campus entry testing of all students, faculty and staff but says colleges may consider testing of asymptomatic students in areas with moderate to significant community transmission, as resources allow. \u201cThere has been ongoing collaboration and coordination between UVa and UVa-Wise throughout the pandemic. Given recent positivity rates of the virus across Virginia, UVa and UVa-Wise decided recently it is best to extend the testing plan for all students with ongoing testing support from the UVa Health Clinic on campus,\u201d Still said. \u201cWe expect to receive more than enough tests for all our students, and our supply will be replenished as needed throughout the semester.\u201d In its announcement last week, the college said 71 residential students were already on campus. Those students, and about 100 employees, were tested that same day using kits from the UVa Health System. Out of about 175 tests, one student tested positive and was quarantined at home, Still said. Residential students were set to begin moving in from Aug. 5-10, with classes beginning this Wednesday. News of the two-week delay came a day before UVa announced it would push back in-person classes and move-in dates by two weeks \u201cin response to an uptick in local and national coronavirus cases.\u201d Students in Charlottesville were set to start moving in Aug. 18, with classes beginning Aug. 25. UVa also cited \u201csupply chain disruptions affecting the availability of testing materials\u201d as a reason for the delay. For tests, both UVa and UVa-Wise are contracting with the company Let\u2019s Get Checked, which has offices in New York and Dublin, Ireland. Each test for UVa-Wise will cost $119, which the college plans to cover using federal CARES Act funding, according to Still. Andrew Leonard, a 20-year-old junior from Norton, said he is concerned about going back to campus. He thinks UVa-Wise\u2019s testing plan should have been the same as UVa\u2019s. But the positive case on campus and uptick in cases locally makes him think a delay isn\u2019t enough. \u201cI really don\u2019t think they should have opened at all,\u201d said Leonard, who is taking most of his classes online. Allen, who said he has an autoimmune disease, said he was happy to hear that UVa-Wise eventually required students to get tested before coming back. But he remains worried about the lack of health care infrastructure in the Southwest Virginia area, and what will happen between the time students receive their test and when they return to campus. \u201cI don\u2019t know how this semester is going to work,\u201d he said.","171":"Officials at the University of Virginia held a virtual town hall on Monday about the school\u2019s reopening plans, largely reiterating messaging from previous announcements. The town hall was meant for community members to ask questions about UVa\u2019s reopening plan as the coronavirus pandemic continues. Officials answered questions that were submitted before the meeting. Before launching into questions, university executives went through talking points that were almost verbatim the comments from a similar town hall on Friday. Last week, UVa announced it was pushing the start of in-person classes from Aug. 25 to Sept. 8 and delaying move-in day for undergraduates from Aug. 18 to \u201cseveral days before\u201d Sept. 8, though no exact date has been announced. Classes will begin online Aug. 25. Charlottesville and Albemarle officials have roundly criticized the decision to have in-person classes, fearing that the return of thousands of students from across the country and world would spur more community spread of the virus. President Jim Ryan said that officials are \u201cTrying to make the best decisions we can with the information in front of us.\u201d The big question, as Ryan admitted, is \u201cWhy are we even trying to bring students back to Grounds at all?\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve believed all along that having students back and doing some instruction in-person was important as long as we could do it safely,\u201d he said. Ryan said UVa\u2019s \u201cmission\u201d is education, research and medical care and all parts of that are \u201cbetter done in person.\u201d \u201cWe know bringing students back to Grounds carries some risk,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there are risks no matter what we decide.\u201d Ryan said employees faced the risk of losing their jobs and some students may have issues with learning online. About two-thirds of UVa students don\u2019t live on Grounds and Ryan said that, even if the university went completely online, they would still be returning to the area. \u201cIt will be better for everyone if these students feel like they\u2019re part of the university community rather than outside of it,\u201d he said. Dr. Mitchell Rosner, chairman of the Department of Medicine, said key benchmarks in the virus\u2019s prevalence appear to be stabilizing. Among those are new cases, percent-positivity and testing capacity. As of Monday, the Thomas Jefferson Health District reported 1,976 virus cases, 145 hospitalizations and 44 deaths. The percent-positivity rate was 5%. Dr. Craig Kent, executive vice president for health affairs, said the UVa Health System \u201cabsolutely\u201d has the ability to handle a surge in virus cases when students return. Ryan said the hospital\u2019s capacity is \u201cfine right now.\u201d To protect students and employees, Chief Operating Officer J.J. Davis said officials have taken a variety of safety measures, including plexiglass shields in classrooms, enhanced cleaning and hand sanitizer dispensers throughout campus. UVa also launched an app that will allow employees and students to conduct daily health screenings. One of the other safety measures discussed Monday, which were already announced, include a requirement for students to submit a negative COVID-19 test and quarantine for 14 days before returning to the Charlottesville area. Most of the measures are focused on self-governance and, last week, officials said that students and organizations that repeatedly don\u2019t comply with the school\u2019s rules for masking and social distancing could face suspension and other penalties. University Counsel Tim Heaphy said the school\u2019s requirements that students wear masks is enforceable on and off Grounds and repeated offenses could result in suspensions and other sanctions through the university. Heaphy said that non-students can report violations of the rules through a form that will be posted on the school\u2019s website. \u201cWe understand that what we do on Grounds matters beyond Grounds,\u201d Ryan said. Chief Student Affairs Officer Pat Lampkin said students\u2019 actions will vastly impact the community and, \u201cI truly believe the majority of our students know this and want to do the right thing.\u201d However, she also said that when students gather with \u201cdrinks and food in good supply,\u201d good judgment can go out the window. One question posed was who would be able to watch football games in the fall. Ryan said the university is still working with the Atlantic Coast Conference to determine if fans will be allowed, although in recent days, schools across the country have been announcing that fall sports have been canceled. Ryan said that if the pandemic worsens and \u201cwe need to change course, we will.\u201d","172":"The moves underscore that as students prepare to return to campus, colleges and universities across the state are juggling financial pressures as they prioritize safety precautions. In a joint statement on Tuesday, William & Mary President Katherine Rowe, Provost Peggy Agouris and Chief Operating Officer Amy Sebring called this summer \u201cthe challenge of a career.\u201d Rowe will ask the school\u2019s Board of Visitors to reduce her compensation by 15% through the end of the calendar year. The provost and COO voluntarily cut their compensation by 12%. Rowe had the 73rd-highest compensation package in a list that ranked the earnings of public college presidents released by The Chronicle of Higher Education last month. Rowe earned $671,621 last year, according to the report. Officials at William & Mary, where classes commence remotely Wednesday and in person after Labor Day, said they are trying to mind costs while anticipating added expenditures related to COVID-19 for things like modifications on campus, personal protective equipment, testing and remote learning. Part of the uncertainty for colleges and universities is the prospect of regional COVID-19 spikes that could leave schools no choice but to again shutter their campuses. \u201cShould W&M be unable to open campus or unable to stay open, shortfalls would be very significant in all areas \u2014 beyond the scale of prior downturns,\u201d the three William & Mary leaders said Tuesday in their joint statement to faculty and staff. George Mason University, which starts classes Aug. 24, is paying particular attention to pandemic conditions in Northern Virginia, where it has campuses in Fairfax, Prince William and Arlington counties. University President Gregory Washington noted in a message to the campus community that the school is troubled by an uptick in Prince William\u2019s positivity rate \u2014 the percentage of those who tested positive \u2014 which was at 9% on Monday. In statements this week, leaders of some of Virginia\u2019s most prominent universities, such as Virginia Tech and George Mason, stressed health preparations but did not sugarcoat the financial woes that would result if the schools reverted to online-only instruction this fall. GMU\u2019s Washington noted that remote instruction has limitations in disciplines such as laboratory science and the performing arts. He said it also could result in barring international students from campus because the federal government is balking at processing visas for international students whose studies are online-only. He added that if the school had to halt on-campus instruction and close residence halls, the financial impact would be \u201cdevastating\u201d for GMU and its workforce. \u201cThe numbers of furloughs and layoffs that would be necessary to balance our budget would be staggering, made all the more challenging in an economy of 10% unemployment.\u201d The University of Virginia will start classes online Aug. 25, before moving in-person Sept. 8. UVa announced in April that President Jim Ryan and other school leaders would take a 10% salary cut and that the school had frozen pay raises and hiring. Ryan brought in $1,188,910 last year, ranking seventh on The Chronicle\u2019s list. Virginia Commonwealth University starts classes Monday. VCU spokesman Mike Porter said last month that \u201cthe university budget will be revisited\u201d after state legislators convene beginning Tuesday to review Virginia\u2019s revenue forecasts and the state budget. Porter said at the time that if VCU needs to make additional budget cuts, \u201cemployee furloughs may be necessary.\u201d Among those furloughed would be President Michael Rao, who brought in $741,073 in total compensation in the 2019 calendar year to rank 55th, according to The Chronicle\u2019s database. Employees who make less than $50,000 would not be affected.","173":"And thanks to an anonymous donor, the testing is free. The more testing that can be accomplished, the sooner those infected can be identified, quarantined and treated \u2014 and the safer we all will be. UVa Health is working with the Virginia Department of Health to set up the schedule. For the foreseeable future, testing will be conducted at Church of Incarnation, 1465 Incarnation Drive, on Mondays 5-8 p.m., and at Mount Zion First African Baptist Church, 105 Lankford Ave., Tuesdays 5-8 p.m. Two additional tests sites will pop up around the area as local needs are identified. No appointments are needed. The Thomas Jefferson Health District also is conducting COVID testing, in Charlottesville-Albemarle and throughout the region. These tests also are free, but appointments are necessary. For details on those opportunities, go to https:\/\/www.vdh.virginia.gov\/thomas-jefferson\/covid-19-testing-sites\/. The UVa Health sites also are listed there. Thank you to these organizations for their efforts, and to the anonymous donor who made UVa\u2019s testing possible.","174":"Six months into the pandemic, the number of COVID-19 tests available in the Thomas Jefferson Health District has increased substantially, though doctors and public health officials watch the numbers closely to ensure that supplies will last. For Central Virginia residents, a patchwork of providers and labs help administer tests and process the results \u2014 a system that can be stressed by an uptick in demand or shortage of supplies, leading to longer wait times for results and less access to tests. The availability of testing has been an issue for Virginia and the country since the pandemic took hold in March. Who can get tested in the area depends on the provider, current federal guidance and the availability of testing supplies. Experts have long said that widespread testing and contact tracing were keys to controlling the virus\u2019 spread. With testing, officials can identify emerging outbreaks and then isolate and quarantine those affected through contact tracing. Dr. Amy Mathers, an infectious-disease physician and associate director of clinical microbiology at the University of Virginia, said test providers need to maintain a quick turnaround time for results. \u201cI think it\u2019s really confusing for the average Joe what\u2019s going on, and even the people that are in the middle of it. Why are some places taking 10 days to turn tests around, and it\u2019s because we don\u2019t have enough tests to go around,\u201d she said. \u201c So the concern is the people that really need a test are not getting timely results, and then it makes the impact of that test \u2014 and the ability to use the test to control transmission \u2014 weakened with a slow turnaround time.\u201d The most common and reliable test for the virus is called a Polymerase chain reaction test, though some groups have started antigen tests to check for the presence of coronavirus antibodies as a way to see if a person has had the virus. Gov. Ralph Northam announced earlier this month that he\u2019s joining a compact with six other states to buy coronavirus testing supplies, including 500,000 antigen tests that would produce results in 15 to 20 minutes. Jessica Coughlin, community testing coordinator for the TJHD, said the increase in providers doing tests has helped the district. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard being one of the main places people want to go and then having limited availability, and our sites fill up so fast,\u201d she said. \u201cHaving a direction to point somebody to for other testing options is huge, and the patients really appreciate it.\u201d In recent weeks, with more businesses and schools reopening, the district has seen an increase in interest for tests. \u201cThere is a demand for testing; the capacity is just not there,\u201d Coughlin said. The health district has run drive-thru testing clinics for months, steadily increasing the number of PCR tests it can administer. Meanwhile, the UVa Medical Center has created its own test, which it processes in-house, and rolled out a plan to provide several testing clinics a week in underserved communities. People also can be tested at CVS and MedExpress, as well as through their doctors. UVa had a goal of running 3,000 tests a day by early June, but Mathers said they have not been given all of the planned allocations of materials and machines and are only running about 750 tests a day. \u201cFor example, we have a machine which could run 1,000 tests per day and we only get allocated about 50 to 80 tests per day,\u201d she said. Key challenges to increasing the number of tests are the supplies needed to collect samples and the capacity of labs to quickly process the tests. Generally, to test someone for the novel coronavirus, a nurse or doctor needs protective equipment such as a gown, face shield, gloves and an N-95 mask, as well as the materials to collect a sample from the person. The testing kit includes a nasal swab and a tube with viral transport media, a fluid that helps keep the virus alive so it can be tested. After the sample is collected, the tube is shipped off to a lab for testing. Which lab it goes to depends on who performed the test. For example, the TJHD sends its tests to the state lab while tests from UVa\u2019s community clinics are run at the Medical Center. The lab also determines how long it will take to hear back about results, along with other factors such as the time of week and whether there\u2019s a surge of cases in other parts of the country. UVa has worked to ensure a quick turnaround of about 24 to 48 hours, while the state lab might take up to five days. Commercial labs such as Quest and Labcorp had a backlog of tests in July following outbreaks in Southern states, which led to longer wait times to hear about results. \u201cI don\u2019t feel that testing is hard to come by, at least in this community,\u201d said Dr. Carlos Armengol, with Pediatric Associates of Charlottesville, which has done COVID-19 testing for patients in the parking lot. \u201cI can\u2019t say the same for others, but I think testing is fairly adequate here.\u201d Even so, the tests are just a snapshot in time, many officials have said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a snapshot of that day, and they could still over the course of the next week or so develop symptoms and get sick,\u201d Armengol said. \u201cI think testing is good when used appropriately. It has limits in terms of what information it\u2019s providing. Just because you test negative doesn\u2019t mean you have the license to go and do whatever you want.\u201d Pediatric Associates Pediatric Associates of Charlottesville has seen a steady increase in the number of patients who have wanted a COVID-19 test, with about four to six a day. Since the beginning of the summer, doctors have administered more than 350 tests after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention changed its guidance on testing children. Pediatric Associates is not testing children without symptoms right now. \u201cAnd so if they have symptoms and they have a contact, then we\u2019re certainly going to want to test those kids,\u201d Armengol said. \u201cWhereas, if they have symptoms but haven\u2019t had contact with anybody who\u2019s had it, then I\u2019m more likely to reassure the parents and say it\u2019s probably just a run-of-the-mill virus. Let\u2019s wait and watch as opposed to testing them and of course wasting more resources. That\u2019s the issue.\u201d Armengol said not every doctor in the area is doing tests at their practices. Others might refer patients to a lab. At Pediatric Associates, tests are done in the parking lot of the practice\u2019s downtown location in order to conserve resources, Armengol said. Additionally, they are scheduled for later in the afternoon. Testing appointments also include a vitals check and examination, albeit in a car. After the sample is collected, they send it to a commercial lab or Sentara Martha Jefferson Hospital. Getting all of the needed testing materials has been a challenge, Armengol said. \u201cWe struggle the most with trying to keep our nasal swabs in stock,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have been unable to consistently get orders filled, and so our supplies slowly dwindled.\u201d If they don\u2019t get more orders in, they\u2019ll run out of swabs in a couple of weeks. \u201cI\u2019m crossing my fingers and hoping we get some,\u201d Armengol said. Health district Since the start of the pandemic, the Thomas Jefferson Health District has been the go-to provider of COVID-19 tests and has increased the number it can offer on a weekly basis in recent months. Tests are currently available for anyone 6 and older, regardless of symptoms or exposure to the virus. The drive-thru clinics, which are held on a rotating basis throughout the district\u2019s service area, are by appointment only. The district does have a waitlist for each site but that does not roll over to other clinics because people tend to find somewhere else to get tested. Health district officials said if those who want an appointment want to get results, they need to set up their voicemails and answer the phone. For August, Coughlin said they increased the numbers of tests for each site from 72 to 125 per day as they continue to fine-tune processes. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve come to realize is that, especially in this heat, three hours is kind of the max out there standing out in PPE, drenched in sweat, to get folks in and out, and they can do 125 in those three hours,\u201d she said. The testing supplies come from the Virginia Department of Health\u2019s state lab and are delivered weekly, depending on the number of clinics. After the drive-thru clinic is done, a courier from the lab picks up the samples and other tests run by the health district. Coughlin said that in August, the health district is focused on having clinics in places where people get services, such as food banks or churches. \u201cWhere they\u2019re comfortable and going regularly \u2014 to make it an easy process for them,\u201d she said. For each site, there\u2019s a district testing coordinator, a greeter who checks the appointments and two nurses who do the actual testing. A specimen processor seals the lab bag and takes care of the samples to ensure they stay cold. Coughlin said it takes about 48 to 72 hours to get results back. The timeframe is better at the beginning of the week, but the district advises that it could take five to seven days. A delay of seven days could mean the test was inconclusive or lab technicians had to retest the sample. One obstacle to offering more clinics and tests is the staffing hours. Coughlin said the testing team members, who work on a contract, can only work a certain number of hours. In addition to manning the clinic, they have back-office responsibilities, from scheduling appointments to preparing each kit. \u201cWhat folks don\u2019t see is all the front end and back end that comes into testing that I still have to use those staff hours for,\u201d she said. To boost capacity, the district is in the middle of hiring a second team to hold more testing clinics in the area. UVa Health System The UVa Health System, in collaboration with the TJHD, this month officially kicked off its free community outreach testing program, which will target vulnerable populations for testing. \u201cThere\u2019s been unequal access to COVID testing amongst people of color in vulnerable populations, and so one of the goals of UVa is to try to ameliorate that disparity and go out to communities where they will feel more comfortable getting tested, and are more likely to come in for testing,\u201d said Dr. Mo Nadkarni, a UVa professor of medicine and physician director of community outreach testing. \u201cOne of the barriers was potentially just a lack of desire to come into the university setting to get tested, for whatever reason,\u201d he said. As of Friday, there were 2,067 confirmed coronavirus cases in the health district. African Americans or Black people account for a quarter of the 44 fatalities in the area and nearly 40% of the 149 hospitalizations. Hispanic or Latinos account for about 17% of the hospitalizations and about 28.5% of the total cases. The community testing program is one prong of coronavirus testing through UVa. Free drive-thru and walk-up testing is available from 5 to 8 p.m. Mondays at Church of Incarnation, 1465 Incarnation Drive, and from 5 to 8 p.m. Tuesdays at Mount Zion First African Baptist Church, 105 Lankford Ave. There will also be two rotating sites on Wednesdays and Thursdays based on community requests and outbreaks. \u201cSo when we find a high density of inpatients that might have come from the same community, that might trigger us to go out to that community, or if in our community testing we find higher rates of incidents, we might focus our testing site there,\u201d Nadkarni said. Nadkarni said they do between 50 and 100 tests at each weekly testing event, and they will test anyone, symptomatic or not, until they run out of tests. Once or twice a month, the Health System will have larger community events at the request of community leaders or organizations that have identified a need. Nadkarni said wraparound services also are being provided at these events, such as food boxes and vegetables from the Local Food Hub\u2019s Fresh Farmacy program. For families that test positive, further services are available, including health education, help with medication and potentially financial support for housing as it relates to the ability to socially distance. The tests from these community events will be processed through UVa, and Nadkarni said they\u2019re telling people results may take up to 72 hours, but it\u2019s usually quicker. The testing events that UVa has held so far have been mainly staffed by volunteers from the community and the Medical Center. \u201cWe are now transitioning and about to try to hire a core staff to take care of the testing events with a sprinkling of volunteers still able to participate as they desire,\u201d Nadkarni said. Mathers said the Health System is testing patients who are symptomatic and health care workers, as well as asymptomatic patients who need testing for travel, work or other reasons at its COVID testing clinic and its Primary Care Riverside facility. \u201cWe try not to do too much [asymptomatic] testing, because we want to make sure that we\u2019ve got enough capacity and good turnaround time for symptomatic patients,\u201d Mathers said. \u201c... But one of the biggest categories that we do test asymptomatic is people that have been in contact with other people or are at risk for exposure for coronavirus to help support contact tracing or outbreak mitigation.\u201d For the testing kits, UVa has been manufacturing its own viral transport media, the fluid that swabs are put in to stabilize the viral RNA. UVa also is manufacturing swabs, not just for its own use, but for public health testing across the state. \u201cWe\u2019ve cleared them with the FDA, they\u2019re registered and we just completed our first batch and sent UVa-manufactured swabs to the Virginia Department of Emergency Management,\u201d Mathers said. The Health System is using four platforms from three different commercial diagnostic companies to run the tests. \u201cWe have to use multiple different commercial vendors because the concern is that with the supply chain, any one of them could run short at any time, which we\u2019ve seen,\u201d Mathers said. She said the Health System is trying to provide a 24-hour turnaround time from the time of collection to the time of results, but results typically come back between 24 and 48 hours. Results for tests done through UVa are electronically communicated automatically to the local health department, Mathers said. Then the health department takes over and does contact tracing. The Health System is not doing as much asymptomatic testing as are a lot of other sites, she said. \u201cOur strategy is to make sure that we have enough capacity to give good turnaround time to the highest-risk and highest-priority patients,\u201d Mathers said.","175":"Pleased because sanctions against violators \u2014 up to and including suspensions \u2014 must be enforced in order to protect the larger community. Disconcerted because one of the ways UVa will monitor students carries with it a whiff of Big Brother-ism: The university will test wastewater from dorms and other buildings to look for coronavirus indicators. The testing is aimed at locating people who are asymptomatic and might be spreading the virus without knowing it, according to comments at a virtual town hall earlier this month. As for violations, UVa Counsel Tim Heaphy said the masking and social distancing requirements will apply off-Grounds as well as on. That\u2019s good news for Charlottesville and Albemarle County, where many students live and many more go for entertainment and social interactions. Some students\u2019 lack of concern for the safety of their city and county neighbors has been a source of anxiety for local residents ever since students were seen, unmasked and crowded together, at parties and bars for Midsummers ritual gatherings. (For that matter, non-students who violate protocols also are sources of angst for others.) UVa has decided on a mix of online and in-person classes, which begin Sept. 8. President Jim Ryan said the mix is important for providing not just the education expected from a university, but also the social and community interactions that traditionally are so important to the college experience. He\u2019s right that college is seen as a time when students mature into young adults, not just intellectually but socially and morally as well. But this is an extraordinary time; the usual rules don\u2019t apply. If UVa can pull off a mixed approach, of course it would be good for students and the school. It also could be good for the local economy, which relies so heavily on student spending \u2014 including those aforementioned bars and restaurants, which might fail (as several restaurants already have done) without student custom. But the success of that plan depends on students\u2019 willingness to follow health rules. Said Mr. Heaphy: \u201cIf someone isn\u2019t wearing a mask, our hope is that they will be reminded of that by a peer, by another student or a faculty member or staff and that there\u2019ll be compliance. Over time, everyone starts to understand and take as normal adherence to those rules. If there\u2019s refusal to comply, if there are repeated violations or very serious ones, those are the issues where we will address with enforcement.\u201d That phrasing raises some concern. It implies that school officials \u201chope\u201d students will learn to comply after repeated reminders from peers, faculty or others. It also refers to student learning taking hold \u201cover time.\u201d Time is a limited commodity, however, in the fight against COVID-19. We suspect that UVa will have to be quick to punish violations if the policy is to succeed. We predict that students may well learn \u201cover time\u201d that they must obey safety rules \u2014 but punishment, not reminders from peers and faculty, is more likely to accomplish that aim. Once students see the university is serious about infractions, then word will spread and behavior will change. And we hope that UVa is prepared to execute that plan \u2014 fairly but firmly.","176":"Positive cases of COVID-19 will be part of the \u201cnew normal\u201d at the University of Virginia as students return to Grounds for the new school year, and a successful return doesn\u2019t mean completely eliminating the risk of infections, officials wrote in a letter to the university community Thursday. \u201cIt means instead that each and every one of us acts to prevent the spread of the virus by following simple but powerful public health measures,\u201d officials wrote. \u201cIt also means that we each stand ready to self-isolate or quarantine and assist with contact tracing in the event of positive cases. These proven methods will prevent further spread of the virus. If we each do our part, we can live, learn and work in this new normal while keeping ourselves and the people around us safe.\u201d The letter was signed by UVa Chief Operating Officer J.J. Davis and Provost Liz Magill. Despite outbreaks at the several universities, UVa is moving forward with its plan to bring students back to the area in early September after delaying the start of in-person classes for undergraduates by two weeks. Students in graduate and professional programs have begun to return as in-person classes for them start this month. On Sunday, the university reported that a law student tested positive. \u201cA positive test in the law school before the beginning of classes illuminated another reality of that new normal \u2014 that cases of COVID-19 will occur,\u201d Magill and Davis wrote, adding that the student is doing well and isolated, per public health guidelines. In the last week, several universities have stopped in-person classes following outbreaks on campus. The University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill reported 135 new cases after one week of in-person classes, prompting officials there to switch courses to online. At the University of Notre Dame, in-person classes were suspended for two weeks after 222 confirmed cases. Like UVa, Notre Dame required students to submit a negative test before returning to campus. Of the nearly 12,000 tests administered to students, 99.7% came back negative, according to a Notre Dame news release. UVa also has strongly recommended that students quarantine for 14 days before coming back. Undergraduates can move into university housing starting Sept. 3. \u201cWe recognize that the news from around the country, including at other universities, continues to create anxiety and uncertainty about the future,\u201d Magill and Davis wrote. UVa spokesman Brian Coy said earlier this week that university officials remain optimistic that the current plan will support a safe return to Grounds. University officials previously have said they are monitoring several factors as they gauge whether to continue with their reopening plan, but they have not released specific metrics regarding those factors. If they decide to change plans, that will be communicated no later than Aug. 28. In Thursday\u2019s letter, Magill and Davis said they are preparing new public information tools to track key metrics related to the virus. \u201cAs we move deeper into the fall semester and more students, faculty and staff return to Grounds, our goal is to keep you informed about the prevalence of the virus in our area and the steps we can take together to limit its spread,\u201d they wrote. Student testing In addition to daily health checks and other preventive measures, a key part of the university\u2019s plan to bring students back is mandatory testing for those intended to return to the Charlottesville area. Students are required to submit a negative test before they can return to Grounds. Once the school year begins, ongoing testing will be used to detect outbreaks and contain the virus. For this plan, UVa is planning to spend as much as $3.2 million to purchase 27,000 coronavirus tests to use before and during the school year. In July, the university contracted with the New York-based Let\u2019s Get Checked to provide free tests for all students. Each test costs $119, according to the contract, obtained via an open-records request, and UVa pays as tests are ordered. Coy said Thursday that the Let\u2019s Get Checked supplies will be used to test students going forward. If the current plan holds, UVa students, staff, faculty and contract employees without symptoms can be tested every 60 days and any students with symptoms will be tested. Additionally, those who are exposed to the virus will be tested even if they don\u2019t show symptoms. Currently, the university does not have plans for widespread surveillance testing, but officials are planning to test the wastewater from residence halls and other buildings to check for potential outbreaks and monitoring reports from the Hoos HealthCheck app. The university also is finalizing arrangements for asymptomatic testing for employees. \u201cAs the pandemic and the testing technology evolve, we will continuously adapt our strategy to keep our community safe,\u201d Coy said. Initially, UVa ordered 20,000 tests in July. A second order, signed Monday, requested an additional 7,000. The one-year contract was signed by Davis. An interview request to Davis about the contract was returned by Coy. He said the second purchase of tests was made out of an abundance of caution to ensure UVa has an adequate reserve supply of tests as it readies for the academic year. \u201cIt does not reflect any current or anticipated shortage at the university, but we do want to be prepared in case such a shortage occurs,\u201d Coy said. Both orders are an estimate, and UVa doesn\u2019t have to buy all 27,000 tests, though the company manufactures the kits in chunks of 3,240. For the initial mandatory testing requirement, students are to request the kits themselves through the company. As part of the contract, Let\u2019s Get Checked will process all of the tests. The university has told students to take the test seven days before they are supposed to return to Grounds and expect results within 48 hours of the lab receiving the sample. They should send their sample between Aug. 20 and Aug. 25, according to a university announcement. Unused test kits cannot be returned.","177":"A new portal from the University of Virginia will allow community members to report concerns about compliance with COVID-19 precautions such as wearing masks, social distancing and not gathering in large groups. UVa said in an announcement that the portal is part of \u201can effort to be a responsible neighbor to the larger Charlottesville community.\u201d As the university works on plans to bring back students next month, community members and elected officials have raised concern that the students\u2019 return could negatively affect the broader community and lead to further spread of the virus. A similar tool has been made available to UVa students, faculty and staff. Community members can access the portal at communityconcerns.virginia.edu. Through the portal, people can share concerns or report behavior that may be contrary to university policies and the expectations for students and employees and provide photos, videos or other documents, according to the announcement. UVa encourages people to report significant violations or persistent instances of noncompliance. \u201cThe goal is to identify significant or repeated noncompliance with University public health policies, including requirements that faculty, students and staff wear face coverings, observe physical distancing and gathering only in small groups not exceeding 15 people,\u201d UVa said in a news release. University Counsel Tim Heaphy has previously said that the school\u2019s requirement that students wear masks is enforceable on and off grounds and repeated offenses could result in suspensions and other sanctions through the university. Reports will be reviewed by university staff, but UVa said it might not be able to share information about what actions are taken in response because of federal privacy regulations that protect students.","178":"The actions of students will determine if the fall semester at the University of Virginia is to remain in-person, a university official said Saturday in a video message. \u201cIn a pandemic, one person\u2019s bad decision has a direct impact on the health and safety of others; that\u2019s why this is so important,\u201d said Allen Groves, dean of students UVa. \u201cThe university has made very clear what must occur for us to offer an on-Grounds experience this fall. These things are non-negotiable and essential to keep everyone healthy and safe.\u201d Groves listed those things as: no gatherings with more than 15 people, wearing a mask inside or outside and maintaining six feet of distance. All of those requirements apply on or off Grounds. Groves\u2019 message follows decisions at several universities across the county and in the Atlantic Coast Conference to switch classes online after outbreaks of COVID-19 on campus and comes days before a university-set deadline to announce whether it is changing plans for the fall. Groves told students those who fail to comply with the new requirements will face immediate sanctions, including suspension. \u201cWe\u2019ve already begun to receive reports of some significant non-compliance,\u201d he said.  Virginia Tech said Thursday that it suspended seven students after off-campus gatherings. Other universities have taken similar actions. \u201cI need you to understand that we will do the same, a suspension for violating these required public health norms will be immediate and for the full semester at a minimum, with no opportunity to continue your courses in person or online,\u201d he said. Officials have previously said that students will face sanctions for non-compliance, but Saturday\u2019s message was a more straightforward warning. Online classes for undergraduates start next week, and they are expected to move into university housing starting Sept. 3. Graduate and professional students have moved back to the area. Undergraduates who live off-Grounds have been asked to delay their return until next month. About two-thirds of students don\u2019t live on Grounds. The university has not said how many students are expected to return for in-person classes this semester. Groves sent a similar message to students about their responsibility in ensuring an on-Grounds fall semester after large gatherings during Midsummers alarmed community members and elected officials. Student organizations from club sports to Greek Life that violate the requirements could also face sanctions including immediate termination of a group\u2019s organizational agreement relationship with UVa. \u201cWe won\u2019t be issuing a series of warnings or multiple strikes before we act,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need full compliance right out of the box right now.\u201d He added that he has faith in students and their ability to be a responsible community. Officials previously pushed the start of in-person classes back to two weeks. If they decide to change plans again, that announcement will be made no later than Aug. 28. \u201cYou know the challenges we face here and elsewhere in trying to contain the spread of COVID-19, the sacrifices required of each of us can seem daunting or even unfair at times, but the stakes are too high not to step up and do the right thing,\u201d he said. Earlier this month, President Jim Ryan released his own video message about the new school year and acknowledged the skepticism that students will follow the new pandemic-related requirements. \u201cSome believe you can\u2019t; others believe you won\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cI confess to have more faith in you than that. I believe you can and will, because I trust you understand that these measures are not just for your own protection, but for the protection of others.\u201d","179":null,"180":"In my home state of Virginia, nursing home residents make up more than half the state\u2019s COVID-19 related deaths. That statistic alone emphasizes the critical need for infection control and sufficient support for these residencies. I\u2019m a physician who specializes in geriatric medicine and works at an academic medical center. Since March, I have led a team to develop a collaborative care model for nursing homes in our community. That means bringing together hospitals, physician groups, community agencies and health departments to figure out how we can all work collectively to improve outcomes for these residents during the pandemic. Our team\u2019s name is GERI-PaL. Its members, with their diverse backgrounds \u2014 doctors, nurses, emergency responders and public health experts \u2014 have created new ways for academic medical centers and hospitals to work with local nursing homes. We believe our model will help these facilities, not only during the pandemic, but beyond. Among other things, our team is assisting them with infection prevention measures. This includes the coordination of testing and treatment for COVID-19. We have improved their access to sub-specialty care with telemedicine, a great tool for patients. And we help the homes obtain personal protective equipment. Our team members have specific roles: The nurse innovator connects directly with the homes to see how we can help. A nurse practitioner, through telementoring, leads an education program for facility administrators and clinical teams. A critical care doctor sees patients with telemedicine, and geriatric doctors provide consultation and assist with palliative care (pain or other symptom relief). Prior to our regional pandemic surge, GERI-PaL had already found success in building collaborations with nursing homes. But our biggest impact is happening now, as we respond to multiple facilities severely hit by COVID-19 outbreaks. Our first and foremost concern, of course, is the care and well-being of residents. Early in the pandemic, staffing crises emerged at many of the facilities. Some workers became ill, some required quarantine, and some decide not to return. With a limited staff, coordination of care becomes more critical than ever. The remaining employees must take on new roles to make up for the loss. So we worked with the homes and primary care providers to make sure all patients were seen during remote daily rounds. In hospitals, daily rounds are typical, but it\u2019s not standard in facilities where residents typically aren\u2019t as sick. We helped arrange telemedicine visits with a critical care doctor who used a virtual stethoscope to listen to heart and lung sounds remotely and connect in real-time video chat with a resident, nurse and primary care physician. This kind of care, we discovered, is effective, efficient and much easier on the resident; instead of a trip to the hospital or doctor\u2019s office, patients can receive treatment and talk to a physician from the nursing home. We had local medical students call residents to talk and offer reassurance, especially during the policy changes that occurred during the initial lockdown. For the residents, this decreased their loneliness and social isolation; for the students, it was a lesson in empathy. And we worked to make sure transfers of patients to and from hospitals and the homes were as straightforward as possible. This alone reduces burdens on the nursing home staff. This bridge between two care sites, long needed, has improved patient care. The lesson from the pandemic that resonates most with me: Doctors and all health care providers must be adaptable and creative. COVID-19 has shown us that nobody has all the answers. But when we follow science and share our ideas, we can care for patients no matter what the circumstance. People often refer to health care workers as heroes. I respectfully propose that the word \u201chero\u201d overlooks the depth of bravery shown each day by doctors, nurses, caretakers and staff, at both the hospitals and nursing homes. They are scared and uncertain, to be sure, but determined to push forward despite the fear. Innovation, I\u2019ve learned, does not always mean an upgrade of the technology. Sometimes, innovation is dedicated people, simply joining together to make things better for their patients, families and communities.","181":"Charlottesville\u2019s Human Rights Commission plans to send a letter to the University of Virginia urging President Jim Ryan to hold classes online. The commission discussed the coming return of students and its impact on the spread of the coronavirus locally during its meeting Thursday. \u201cBringing 10,000 bodies to a small town poses a risk and we\u2019re seeing it at the universities that have already opened,\u201d Commissioner Kathryn Laughon said. The commission is largely an advisory and community outreach panel, while also investigating discrimination complaints. Online classes for undergraduates start Tuesday. Undergrads are expected to move into university housing starting Sept. 3, with classes to switch to in-person on Sept. 8. Undergraduates who live off-Grounds, about two-thirds of students, have been asked to delay their return until next month. Graduate and professional students already have moved back to the area to attend in-person classes. Several universities across the country already have reverted to online classes after seeing outbreaks of COVID-19. UVa officials have set a deadline of this Friday for determining if the semester will go fully virtual. \u201cIt\u2019s just a concern for a lot of the population in Charlottesville and especially the older seniors in the community or anyone who has any health issues,\u201d said Commissioner Ann Smith. UVa has said that students must follow strict guidelines on and off Grounds to slow the spread of the virus, including no gatherings with more than 15 people, wearing a mask inside and outside and maintaining six feet of distance from others. Officials have said that non-compliance will result in sanctions. Local government officials already have sounded the alarm about students returning to the area, but haven\u2019t sent any formal communications to university officials urging them to change course. \u201cThis is putting the staff of the university at risk,\u201d Laughon said. \u201cIt\u2019s putting the residents of the city at risk.\u201d Joint meeting postponed In other business, the commission discussed a planned joint meeting with the City Council that has now been delayed. The meeting was scheduled for this Tuesday. The two bodies haven\u2019t held a joint meeting since October 2018. The meeting was meant to discuss the future of the commission and the Office of Human Rights, along with potential changes to beef up the authority of both entities. The commission and office have been scrutinized since inception, with some saying they don\u2019t do enough to investigate complaints and others faulting the City Council for limiting their powers. The changes under consideration include hiring a director for the office with legal and civil rights credentials, as well as the office and commission jointly conducting one major study on systemic discrimination per year. Mayor Nikuyah Walker said the meeting was delayed to allow time for the city to hire a deputy city manager for racial equity, diversity and inclusion. The position will oversee the Office of Human Rights and the Police Civilian Review Board. \u201cI don\u2019t think it would be very productive because we don\u2019t have a lot of the answers that you all will be looking for,\u201d Walker said of holding the meeting this week. Commission chair Shantell Bingham said the decision \u201cmakes a ton of sense to me\u201d and that the point of the meeting was to \u201chave everybody at the table.\u201d \u201cWe all know that our city needs to do better,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd we all know that we need to hire people who are capable of doing that work.\u201d","182":"Spurred by dissatisfaction with the University of Virginia\u2019s pandemic response, a group of UVa employees is announcing Monday that they are forming a union and want officials to reconsider their plans for the fall semester. The group of employees currently is mostly made up of graduate student workers. The union, part of United Campus Workers, also would include undergraduate student workers, faculty and staff, including those in the UVa Health System. \u201c[United Campus Workers-Virginia] was formed over the summer as a direct result of growing dissatisfaction with the university\u2019s repeated sidelining of student and worker input when developing its pandemic response,\u201d organizers said in a news release. State law bars the university from recognizing the union but doesn\u2019t prevent employees from unionizing. Employees involved with the effort said they hope to put public pressure on UVa officials to support changing to law to allow collective bargaining for state employees. UVa staff members previously had a union from 2002 to 2008. UVa employs about 28,000 people, according to its human resources website. Organizers didn\u2019t say how many would be eligible to join the union or how many support the effort. Last year, a group of undergraduate student workers threatened to strike and explore unionizing if their working conditions didn\u2019t improve. That threat was called off because state law bars strikes among state employees and they would have been fired for doing so. Evan Brown, a doctoral student in the biology department and member of the union\u2019s steering committee, said the group mostly consists of graduate students but they do have some staff, faculty and undergraduate employees on board. \u201cWe want to illustrate that we\u2019re trying to look out for everybody\u2019s interests,\u201d he said. Brown said a key issue among employees is safety and health concerns related to the return of students. Some employees have said they felt forced to work on Grounds when they weren\u2019t comfortable doing so. \u201cWith students coming in, everybody is worried about getting coronavirus,\u201d he said, adding that going online shouldn\u2019t mean lost wages for employees. He said he didn\u2019t feel like he had a voice in the decisions made for the fall semester. Organizers said in announcing the campaign for an online-only semester that they are worried about a lack of transparency and unclear priorities from UVa leadership and the reliance on student self-governance to avoid a local outbreak. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that workers and staff concerns are not at the front of their mind,\u201d said Crystal Luo, a doctoral student in the history department and member of the steering committee. More information about the group\u2019s demands regarding the fall semester can be found at unitedcampusworkers.org\/virginia. Some universities that have brought students back in recent weeks have had to switch to online classes shortly afterward after rising COVID-19 cases among students. Organizers specifically cited the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill as an example. UNC sent students home after 135 students tested positive during the first week of classes. \u201cUNC is not that different from UVa,\u201d Brown said. \u201c\u2026 There\u2019s no reason to think things will be different.\u201d UVa officials have said they will announce by this Friday if they decide to change course for the fall semester. Organizers also support demands for racial equity from other students groups. \u201cIt was important that we build on the work already being done here at UVa rather than reinventing the wheel,\u201d Luo said. \u201cWe want the union to help bring people and resources together.\u201d The employees are forming the union through United Campus Workers, an affiliate of the Communication Workers of America that has local chapters in eight states, mostly in the Southeast. With Monday\u2019s announcement, the employees are forming the ninth chapter and hope to expand to other public universities in the state. Employees at the College of William & Mary started a union last year. Luo said the UVa group chose to organize with United Campus Workers because of its track record at other public universities and ability to secure gains without official recognition. University staff previously were represented by the CWA, but the Staff Union at the University of Virginia was shut down in 2008 after the group didn\u2019t meet the CWA\u2019s membership requirements. Brown said this latest organizing effort is different because it includes all employees at the university. \u201cIf enough people join us and support each other and as long as we all share the vision that we want to improve this university, then we can improve it for the most exploited and disregarded employees,\u201d he said. The union wouldn\u2019t cover contract workers, some of whom were furloughed when the university ended in-person classes in March. UVa later established a $2 million fund to help those contract employees following several news reports about the struggles they were facing. Those directly employed through the university continued to receive paychecks. After increased calls from students and the community, UVa committed last year to raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour for employees, including full-time contract workers. Luo said unionizing now gives the employees a way to speak as a group and talk about common interests and issues such as health care. \u201cWe want to have an honest conversation about how the university treats its employees,\u201d she said.","183":"Virginia Tech, Radford University and Roanoke College already have suspended or \u201cremoved\u201d more than a dozen students for violating anti-COVID protocols. The University of Virginia warns it will do the same if necessary. Students at the other three institutions had moved into dorms or apartments earlier this month or in July. The violations appear to have occurred off campus, at parties where social distancing was non-existent and masks were not in evidence. UVa already has seen evidence of that behavior, at Midsummers parties in July, which generated reports of non-distanced crowds of students who were not wearing masks. The reports prompted UVa to issue stern warnings about compliance with COVID safety rules and to stress that the rules were applicable off Grounds as well as on. In Blacksburg, home of Virginia Tech, the town council recently had passed an ordinance restricting gatherings to no more than 50 people \u2014 a number that seems fairly generous. Law enforcement officers notified Tech about several large parties where participants not only failed to maintain COVID protocols but were \u201cdisruptive to the community.\u201d Virginia Tech placed seven students on \u201cinterim suspension\u201d \u2014 which is a kind of emergency, immediate suspension in force \u201cto preserve the safety of persons or property,\u201d according to a school spokesman. Students have five days to meet with an administrator to discuss the justice of the suspension. Radford University suspended three students for \u201cendangering conduct\u201d and violation of COVID rules. Reports tie some of the suspensions to large gatherings held even after students had been warned that previous parties were out of line. Radford has imposed stern punishments for these particular students: Two were suspended for the semester and one for the entire academic year. As harsh as those sanctions might seem, the situation at Roanoke College is, in one way, even worse: There, three and perhaps four students have tested positive for COVID-19, and the infections seem to be related to an off-campus gathering. Roanoke College says it has \u201cremoved\u201d the students. One student withdrew from school before classes started. Three have been placed in isolation following their positive tests. A total of seven were \u201cremoved\u201d for violating the school\u2019s COVID protocols. Roanoke College will begin in-person classes on Sept. 7, one day before UVa does. But at colleges around the state, students began moving back into apartments \u2014 in Blacksburg, Salem, Radford, Charlottesville, and elsewhere \u2014 well in advance of classes. UVa has said that masking and social distancing requirements will apply off-Grounds as well as on. It has said punishments for violations of these rules can include suspensions. Previously in this space, we had speculated that UVa would need to enforce those rules and implement those punishments speedily in order to impress on students the seriousness of the situation. Nothing is so instructive as an object lesson. We hope students are paying attention to their peers\u2019 experiences at other schools. Students can be, and are being, sickened by COVID because they failed to protect themselves and others. Students can and will be suspended for reckless behavior that endangers themselves and others. If UVa students can learn this lesson from afar, they won\u2019t have to experience it here. And they \u2014 and we \u2014 will all be safer.","184":"The University of Virginia is providing 60,000 nasal swabs to the state each week in support of high-priority coronavirus testing. UVa officials worked with a local engineer to design the swabs and the school plans to produce 75,000 a week, according to a press release. Of those, 15,000 will remain at UVa Health to support testing locally. \u201cThere have been critical shortages across Virginia and across the country of nasopharyngeal swabs for COVID-19 testing,\u201d Dr. Amy Mathers, UVa\u2019s associate director of clinical microbiology, said in a press release. \u201cThese swabs will allow our supply chain team to focus on other areas where testing supplies remain limited.\u201d Mathers was part of a group that included William Guilford, a biomedical engineer in the School of Engineering, and local engineer Andy Homyk to design the swabs. \u201cThe unusually strong spirit of collaboration that we enjoy at UVa was immeasurably helpful when it came to meeting this challenge,\u201d Guilford said in the release. \u201cWe all understood the importance of working together to get this done, and to do it right.\u201d The group started with a 3D print of a swab prototype and then created an injection-molded plastic swab that Mathers successfully tested for safety and effectiveness in a clinical trial at UVa Medical Center. UVa has received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the swabs. The school is working with private companies to private companies to manufacture, sterilize and package the swabs for use. \u201cI am very appreciative of the hard work of this UVa team to develop this vital testing supply, which will also support UVa\u2019s ongoing testing efforts in communities around the Charlottesville area,\u201d Dr. K. Craig Kent, UVa\u2019s executive vice president for health affairs, said in the release. Mathers said in the release that other hospitals and health systems could replicate the swab\u2019s design and begin using them after conducting a similar clinical trial at their own facility.","185":"Politics must stay out of COVID-19 testing and treatment if the pandemic is to be controlled, several medical professionals told Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., during a Tuesday panel hosted by Democratic hopeful Dr. Cameron Webb. Webb, who is vying for the seat representing Virginia\u2019s 5th Congressional district, arranged the event, and said he hoped it would help frontline workers bring their issues directly to the Warner. Hosted at Champion Brewing Company\u2019s outdoor pavilion in Charlottesville, Warner and Webb \u2014 seated at a distance from each other to follow CDC guidelines \u2014 spoke with a panel of six doctors and frontline workers about what issues they\u2019ve seen while combating COVID-19 and what they believe may help bring the pandemic under control. Webb, a doctor, assistant professor of medicine and a director of health policy and equity at the University of Virginia, began the round table by stressing the qualifications of the speakers, all of whom were there in their personal capacities and not representing their organizations or employers. Warner, introducing himself to the others, spoke about his efforts so far, which include helping pass the CARES Act and working on legislation to assist Black-owned small businesses. Though the stock market has been up, Warner said, the market does not reflect the financial insecurities facing millions of Americans. \u201cI\u2019ve been trying to help in the ways I know how to from my experience as a businessman, but there are things I don\u2019t know that medical professionals are indispensable voices for,\u201d Warner said. Over the course of the hourlong conversation, the speakers highlighted many inequities, particularly as they relate to who is and is not getting tested. Dr. Ebony Hilton said that the pandemic has had a disproportionate impact on the Black community , pointing to a higher national infection and death rate among Black people. Hilton said the COVID-19 pandemic is not unique, as Black Americans face systemic challenges and higher rates of disease and death than any other racial group. \u201cMany Black people are frustrated that people are surprised we\u2019re dying at higher rates, because we\u2019ve been dying at higher rates since we were brought over here in 1619,\u201d she said. \u201cWhy is that and why is America OK with that?\u201d While Paycheck Protection Programs and other assistance programs for businesses can help some, Hilton said she is more inclined to support programs that build and strengthen communities from the ground up. Dr. Leigh-Ann Webb, an emergency room physician and Cameron Webb\u2019s wife, said the strain of the pandemic has been particularly heavy on her and her colleagues. Those near Charlottesville are lucky as there is access to robust medical care, but for some in more rural and underserved communities the risk of death is higher. \u201cWhether or not someone got care is like whether or not they had access to high-quality broadband,\u201d she said. \u201cNow we\u2019re seeing a robust increase in the emergency response and we\u2019re hoping to apply an equity lens to everything we do.\u201d Kellen Squire, who works as an emergency room nurse at Sentara Martha Jefferson, expressed frustration with how, despite being six months into the pandemic, testing and personal protective equipment are still inadequate. \u201cI heard stories growing up about how during World War II within six months we were ... building tanks and planes and stuff like that, but now we can\u2019t even make enough swabs for people\u2019s noses in the year 2020,\u201d he said. Dr. Amy Salerno, who works in geriatric and palliative care at UVa Medical Center, stressed the value of testing as a means of reducing case numbers. It is not enough, she said, just to increase production of testing materials; quicker, cheaper and more discrete tests are also needed. \u201cPeople are terrified and it takes them a long time before they\u2019re willing to come and get it done because it\u2019s uncomfortable, and so having a quick saliva test will go a long way to improving access,\u201d she said. \u201cAnother area of access for testing that we\u2019ve seen over and over again as a barrier is the turnaround time, because by the time that you get the results back you could have likely spread the virus to several others.\u201d Wrapping up the conversation, Webb said there was a throughline in the issues raised: the failure of systems and of politicians to listen to medical science. \u201cIn this conversation, I feel we all recognize that we\u2019re not talking about politics, we\u2019re talking about science and we\u2019re talking about systems, we\u2019re talking about how they align, how they all come together and how they fail,\u201d he said. \u201cI think so much of our work is spending time trying to de-politicize this, which is really a systematic conceptual failure.\u201d Webb then promised to continue the conversation during the campaign. Webb will face off against Republican candidate Bob Good on Nov. 3.","186":"The dashboard includes the number of total cases at UVa including faculty, staff, students and contract employees, as well as total student cases.

On average, UVa Health\u2019s Hospital Testing Lab has taken an average of 16 hours to complete lab tests from Aug. 19 to Aug. 26, according to the dashboard. Local officials have been sounding the alarm about students returning to the area, saying it could contribute to the spread of the coronavirus. Meanwhile, several schools across the country have quickly opted to go all-virtual as virus cases have spiked among returning students. Online classes for undergraduates started Tuesday. Undergrads are expected to move into university housing starting Sept. 3, with classes switching to in-person on Sept. 8. Undergraduates who live off-Grounds, about two-thirds of students, have been asked to delay their return until next month.

The decision comes after the university earlier this month delayed the start of in-person classes by two weeks amid a late summer surge in COVID-19 cases. \u201cWe know some will be delighted to hear this news and others will be disappointed,\u201d the release, issued by the university\u2019s top four administrators, states. \u201cIt was a very difficult decision made in the face of much uncertainty and with full awareness that future events may force us to change course,\u201d Friday\u2019s statement was signed by President Jim Ryan, Provost Liz Magill, Executive Vice President J.J. Davis and Executive Vice President for health affairs K. Craig Kent. The executives said the decision was made because students will be living in town regardless of how classes are held. \u201cThe vast majority of our students will be here in Charlottesville, living in private houses and apartments, regardless of whether classes are all online or not,\u201d they wrote in the statement. \u201cBy welcoming our students into classrooms and on Grounds, with adequate testing, rules about gatherings and mask-wearing, and enforcement, we will be in a better position to monitor what\u2019s happening and to contain any outbreaks.\u201d The decision was not without opposition. Pressure mounted during the two-week delay for the university to abandon the plan, as COVID-19 cases rose at colleges opening up around the state. Members of the university\u2019s Student Council Executive Board opposed the plan. Charlottesville and Albemarle County elected officials passed restrictive ordinances designed to lessen the spread of the virus should students return. The school\u2019s Board of Visitors met in executive session Thursday to discuss a variety of coronavirus-related topics, including the health and safety of faculty, staff and students, as well as legal issues and testing protocols. School officials said they are confident that the university is well-equipped to test and isolate students as necessary. That\u2019s a confidence members of the Student Council Executive Board don\u2019t share. On Wednesday they released a statement calling for virtual classes and cessation of in-person courses. \u201cThe university cannot, in good conscience, resume in-person instruction. COVID-19 will spread, the Charlottesville community will suffer, and students, faculty, staff, and community members will die,\u201d the board wrote. Although the administration\u2019s statement did not directly address the council board\u2019s concerns, the statement argued that some areas of the university education and experience cannot be virtual. \u201cA key part of that experience is the opportunity for our students to step out on their own, in a caring and protective environment, to find their own interests, to define their personal commitments, and to form friendships that will sustain them for many years, if not a lifetime,\u201d administrators wrote. \u201cThis is quite difficult, if not impossible, to do online.\u201d On Wednesday, the university\u2019s Greek community agreed to suspend \u201call organized in-person activities\u201d in the pandemic\u2019s wake. \u201cThis is applicable to all fraternity\/sorority sponsored or supervised functions, including formal and informal gatherings,\u201d the Inter-Fraternity Council and Inter-Sorority Council announced. \u201cWe are making this decision in the interest of protecting the public health of the university and greater Charlottesville community.\u201d UVa residence staff, including resident assistants and senior residents, issued a letter to university officials on Friday prior to the administration\u2019s announcement seeking additional training, added protection and inclusion as university employees to protect their positions and income. The letter noted that many students and resident assistants are returning \u201cdue to the need of immediate access to stable shelter, internet access, food, and safety.\u201d Among the requests, the letter seeks financial compensation and hazard pay for resident staff, personal protective equipment and for staff to be considered student employees. The letter was signed by several student organizations and students, but the resident staff remained anonymous to avoid retaliation. \u201cWe are constantly trying to navigate the gray area of sharing concerns that are often unaddressed without running the risk of removal or penalties,\u201d the letter states. \u201cWe are choosing the route of anonymity due to the blanket restrictions surrounding media coverage.\u201d UVa on Wednesday released an online coronavirus dashboard that features a COVID-19 tracker. The tracker shows 67 total cases at the university, between faculty, students, staff and contract employees. Of those cases, 40 are among students who were tested by UVa\u2019s Student Health and Wellness or a UVa clinic, according to the chart. Officials on Friday said the university has put in place testing plans, quarantine spaces and behavioral expectations to combat a possible case spike similar to those at other colleges and universities. The released stressed that many new cases at schools appear to have been connected to activities happening off campus. \u201cWe\u2019ve learned from what has happened at other schools. Over the last few weeks, we\u2019ve developed more ambitious testing plans, created additional spaces for isolation and quarantine, and focused on communicating behavioral expectations,\u201d the administrators wrote. \u201cWe\u2019ve also learned that most outbreaks have been tied to off-campus gatherings, not to on-campus housing and not to classrooms. Indeed, our public health experts believe that classrooms are very low-risk environments.\u201d","191":"Supply chain issues are still hampering the University of Virginia Health Systems\u2019s COVID-19 test processing efforts. UVa had a goal of running 3,000 tests a day by early June, but is currently only running about 750 tests a day due to material shortages, among other issues. Melinda Poulter, director of clinical microbiology, said they\u2019re not limited by the capacity of the instruments. \u201cIf you add up the capacity of all of our instrumentation, theoretically, we should be able to do 3,000 tests today, and that was the goal,\u201d she said. \u201cBut what we didn\u2019t anticipate was all the supply chain problems, and the fact that although a company can give you an instrument that can do 1,000 or even 1,500 tests a day, they might not be able to provide you with enough reagents to do that every day.\u201d The Health System is using four platforms from three different commercial diagnostic companies to run the tests. One, the Cepheid GeneXpert Infinity, could run nearly 1,500 tests a day, but the university was only initially allocated materials to run 100 tests a day. Poulter said they are reserving that test for patients where a fast answer is especially needed, and they had been saving about half of the materials, which the Health System is using now. Last week, they were given enough materials to do 36 samples a day. \u201cIt just keeps going down, and it\u2019s so frustrating,\u201d Poulter said. \u201cThese are just manufacturing problems with the company. They can only manufacture so many of these cartridges, they only have so many manufacturing facilities, and everybody in the world wants these cartridges and wants these kits. So you\u2019re competing with every other hospital system in the country or in the world.\u201d The company has announced it has developed a four-in-one test that will test specimens for SARS-CoV-2, Flu A, Flu B and RSV from one sample. Poulter said she\u2019s hopeful that Cepheid will be able to provide more cartridges when the new test is ready. \u201cWe have three other platforms that we do testing on, as well, because the only way to overcome all the supply shortages is to diversify your instrumentation because all of the companies, every one of them, have supply shortages of something at some point in time,\u201d she said. The university has been waiting for months for another new instrument that Poulter hopes will allow them to increase capacity to about 1,500 tests per day. The instrument is now scheduled to arrive in September. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to have it by the end of September once the students are back,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re really going to need to be able to ramp up our testing.\u201d In a letter sent Friday afternoon regarding the decision for UVa to stick with plans to begin in-person classes on Sept. 8, university officials said \u201cconcerns about the supply chain for testing materials have been addressed.\u201d UVa contracted with an outside company for students to test themselves before they can return to Grounds, but once here, students who are symptomatic will be tested through the student health center or the Medical Center. UVa has made some materials to overcome shortages, such as swabs, but Poulter said she doesn\u2019t think they would make some of the other plastics, like a particular type of pipette tip, because they\u2019re so specific to the instrument. She said they are also limited by staffing and lab and storage space. \u201cWe are in Central Virginia, we\u2019re not in a big metro area where there\u2019s a lot of really highly skilled certified medical technologists or clinical laboratory scientists that are trained to do this work .... I mean, there are really exceptional scientists, but it\u2019s a challenge to find people with the qualifications we need.\u201d","192":"The Virginia Department of Health reported on Monday that the statewide total for COVID-19 cases is 120,594 cases.

With most college football and other sports cancelled, many colleges and universities lost a large source of revenue in addition to the losses they suffered refunding housing and dining fees and moving most, if not all of their classes online. Although it\u2019s too early to know exactly how large the total financial hit from COVID-19 will eventually be, a letter sent in April to the leadership of the House of Representatives by several Democratic members of Virginia\u2019s congressional delegation painted a dire picture. \u201cAbsent significant additional financial support from Congress, many institutions will face the prospect of immediate layoffs, devastating budget cuts, program eliminations, and possible closures,\u201d read the letter signed by Reps. Donald McEachin, D-4th, Don Beyer, D-8th, Jennifer Wexton, D-10th, and Gerry Connolly, D-11th. \u201cDirect federal funding is desperately needed to help these institutions address revenue losses and expenses resulting from the COVID-19 crisis.\u201d For example, Virginia Commonwealth University was projecting at least $50 million in lost revenue and instituted a hiring and salary freeze in July. But according to salary data obtained by The Richmond Times-Dispatch under the Freedom of Information Act, VCU President Michael Rao\u2019s total annual compensation was $1 million in 2019, making him one of the highest-paid public university presidents in the nation. So is University of Virginia president James Ryan, who makes $1.8 million a year in total compensation, according to the Chronicles of Higher Education, while UVa is facing $18 million in losses for refunds for on-campus housing and dining that students couldn\u2019t use. William & Mary President Katherine Rowe and Virginia Tech President Tim Sands are also in the top 100 highest paid public university administrators in the U.S., both taking home paychecks in the $600,000 range. Ryan and others announced in April that they would accept a 10 percent pay cut to help their institutions weather the COVID-19 storm, calling it a \u201cshared sacrifice.\u201d But the real question is: Should the leaders of tax-supported colleges and universities be paid such high salaries in the first place? Tuition and fees at Virginia\u2019s state-supported institutions of higher learning have increased every year since 2001 far beyond the rate of inflation, while student debt has continued to skyrocket. While top administrative salaries are just a small part of this increase, they do add to the year-over-year tuition hikes that make Virginia\u2019s state colleges and universities less and less affordable for many students. During the current crisis, their boards of trustees need to review their compensation policies and scale back all future contracts and pay increases. The notion that they can\u2019t find any qualified individuals to run these campuses unless they offer luxurious salaries and cushy benefits that put them in the top 1 percent of all Americans is ludicrous. Giving administrators a haircut will be a concrete indication that they are indeed serious about holding down escalating costs. And if these institutions \u2014 which are supposedly devoted to learning instead of lining their leaders\u2019 pockets \u2014 won\u2019t do that, they should stop asking struggling taxpayers for help paying their bills.","195":"RICHMOND \u2014 After reporting more than 500 active coronavirus cases less than a week after in-person classes started, James Madison University on Tuesday announced it would send students home and shift to primarily online courses starting Monday. In a message posted to the school\u2019s website Tuesday evening, university President Jonathan R. Alger wrote that the decision came after consultation with the Virginia Department of Health. Students are being asked to leave campus by Monday. \u201cWhat we have observed is a fairly steady and abrupt uptick in the positive cases of COVID-19 in our student body,\u201d university spokeswoman Caitlyn Read said in an interview Tuesday evening. \u201cWe saw numbers come in from over this past weekend, particularly a high number of self-reports. And so that was absolutely one factor we looked at. \u201cThe other factor we looked at was we were becoming very concerned with our ability to offer isolation and quarantine space to our on-campus residents who needed it.\u201d Virginia colleges had reported more than 1,400 coronavirus cases as of Tuesday. The 528 at JMU are the most in the state. The Harrisonburg school becomes the first in the state to retreat from in-person classes after trying them to start the semester, though classes are scheduled to be held in person through the end of the week unless students hear otherwise from a professor, according to Alger\u2019s message. Some licensure, graduate and upper-level coursework at JMU will continue in person through the end of the month. Read said such hybrid course formats are the exception, but the overwhelming majority of undergraduate instruction will be online. University officials will continue to monitor trends and developments and announce by Sept. 25 whether in-person instruction may resume on or after Oct. 5. Students staying in on-campus housing \u2014 more than 6,000 \u2014 need to move out by Monday unless they have a compelling reason to stay. Read said she expects many students living off campus to stay in town. The number of total positive cases at JMU skyrocketed after students started to move into dorms on Aug. 21. Classes began Aug. 26. The day before classes began, the university released a publicly available COVID-19 dashboard showing 23 self-reported student cases and six faculty. On Tuesday, a week later, the school reported 513 active cases. Jacob Seefried, a JMU freshman from Harrisonburg, said he\u2019s noticed since the beginning of the semester that some people take safety precautions seriously, but others don\u2019t. \u201cSome organizations and some groups and clubs are doing a good job at promoting social distancing and showing that you actually can have these activities and have campus life carry on, if you just change a couple things,\u201d Seefried said. \u201cI don\u2019t know any specifics, but I\u2019ve heard about other activities that pretty much don\u2019t care and they\u2019ve all been getting together and not distancing at all. Things like that.\u201d The school, which has an enrollment of 19,943 undergraduate students, reported Monday that 64 of its 143 isolation beds were being used. A daily case count shows that three of the highest daily positive student test totals through the university\u2019s health center were recorded since Friday \u2014 37 on Friday, 36 on Saturday and 30 on Sunday. The school on Tuesday reported its highest daily rise in self-reported student cases: 120. JMU did not require students to be screened for COVID-19 before returning to campus like some schools in the state. The university found many of the cases were contracted through socializing, according to Read. \u201cThrough social gatherings,\u201d Read said. \u201cSo college student behavior where they\u2019re hanging out with their friends. And the overwhelming majority is at off-campus events.\u201d Seefried, in the early morning hours Tuesday, posted a video to Twitter of his Problem Solving Approaches in Science and Technology class, a general education course where so many people were packed into a ballroom that there weren\u2019t enough seats and about a dozen students were huddled on the ground in the back. He had the class again Tuesday afternoon, but this time online. \u201cI think and a lot of other people, after getting to that class for the first time, I think we\u2019re all just deciding to do it from online instead,\u201d Seefried said. Seefried, a computer science and business double major, had a mix of hybrid classes like that, and online courses, out of the four he\u2019s currently enrolled in. Outside of class, Seefried observed challenges in dining halls, where distancing was erased while students waited in lines. \u201cAnd there\u2019s nothing being enforced,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd there\u2019s just a huge amount of people inside a small space at once.\u201d Over the next few weeks, as it evaluates the next move, JMU will examine the prevalence of COVID-19 in the surrounding community, including Harrisonburg and Rockingham County. It will also look at increasing isolation space and the university\u2019s own testing capabilities. Gov. Ralph Northam was asked about the rise in cases at colleges and universities in the state at his briefing Tuesday before JMU\u2019s announcement and said it\u2019s something that\u2019s being watched \u201cvery closely.\u201d \u201cWe expect our colleges and universities to continue to follow their plans, and also to work with the local health districts,\u201d Northam said. \u201cAnd as long as we see that continuing to happen, then I think we can proceed. But if it\u2019s not ... I certainly have the opportunity to intervene and make changes.\u201d {span}Across Virginia{\/span}, the extent of coronavirus outbreaks has varied at college campuses. Some schools have seen numbers climb quickly, though none as high as at James Madison: The University of Virginia, Virginia Tech and Virginia Commonwealth University have between 100 and 200 cases. Others have seen their totals remain relatively low. The College of William & Mary has experienced just 15 students and fewer than 10 employees and staff test positive. These numbers represent small percentages of overall student enrollment. Students are young and often asymptomatic, and hospitalization rates are often low. So just how worrisome is it when 100 or 500 coronavirus cases spring up on a college campus? The answer, said Lisa M. Lee, a professor of public health at Virginia Tech who specializes in epidemiology and bioethics, depends on a university\u2019s capacity to keep students in quarantine or isolation and the resources the school has to handle an outbreak. \u201cFive hundred cases at one university might be within the scope of what they can handle, and it might overwhelm another university,\u201d Lee said. By Tuesday, JMU students had occupied 45% of 143 isolation beds available. Colleges often use the term \u201cisolation\u201d to refer to students who tested positive and are waiting out their illness and \u201cquarantine\u201d to refer to students exposed to the virus and staying home. That was another factor at JMU. \u201cAs a result of a rapid increase in the number of positive cases of COVID-19 in our student population in a short period of time, the university is concerned about capacity in the number of isolation and quarantine spaces we can provide,\u201d Alger said in his announcement. \u201cProtecting the health of our Harrisonburg and Rockingham County community \u2014 including students, faculty, staff \u2014 is our top priority, and we need to act swiftly to stop the spread as best we can.\u201d Lee said Virginia Tech has filled 24% of its isolation space, so the school currently does not have cause to worry. VCU has used 21% of 160 beds, and UVA, which hasn\u2019t resumed in-person classes yet, reports it\u2019s not using any of its isolation beds. VCU created more isolation capacity by adding beds at the Honors College dorm, raising its total from 50 to 160. Every university spent the summer creating plans to handle outbreaks, Lee said. If a university sees 100 cases pop up from a particular event, and if the university can quickly identify the cases, contact the participants and quarantine the necessary individuals, 100 positive cases might not represent a large hurdle. The positive tests that have occurred so far come as no big surprise, generally speaking, she said. Colleges spent the whole summer making plans for handling the coronavirus because positive cases were inevitable. It\u2019s going to happen when distant populations are brought together in one place, Lee said. To some extent, Lee said, a university\u2019s total case count in the first two weeks is luck of the draw. In some of those cases, students bring the virus to campus with them. But after two weeks, after the initial incubation period is over, university communities then face a turning point. Will counts plateau, or will they continue to increase? This is the bigger test of how well a university\u2019s plan for handling positive cases will hold up, Lee said. But JMU was overwhelmed before reaching two weeks.","196":"For the first time in its 29-year history, the United Way Laurence E. Richardson Day of Caring was all about people keeping their social distance. From the kick off breakfast to the projects chosen to help out nonprofits to the limited number of volunteers, the day was a distanced version of its former self, but that didn\u2019t dampen spirits. \u201cWe always kick off the day with a breakfast rally but with social distancing in this time of COVID, it\u2019s not possible to do it the way we used to,\u201d said Caroline Emerson, vice president of community engagement and campaign for the United Way of Greater Charlottesville, as she placed balloons and straightened posters prior to the morning\u2019s meal. \u201cWe can only have about 50 people at the breakfast so what we\u2019re doing is those who can\u2019t be with us will pick up breakfast here and take it out to the project sites with them,\u201d Emerson said. \u201cLike everyone else, we\u2019re trying to find another way.\u201d The breakfast was streamed live on Facebook for those volunteers who might otherwise have attended. \u201cThis year we\u2019ve had to be creative about offering and implementing new, virtual, decentralized projects to still allow for people to volunteer because we remain convinced that this event is one that should continue,\u201d said Ravi Respeto, president and chief executive officer for the charity. \u201cIn this era of uncertainty brought about by COVID-19 it\u2019s heartening to know that hundreds of people in our community still have the energy and selflessness to give of themselves to help their neighbors and community,\u201d she said. Much changed for the charity\u2019s event that brings more than 2,000 volunteers out of the office and into the community to help nonprofits, groups and individuals with needed repairs and projects. The limitations led organizers to hope for about 300 volunteers, but nearly 1,000 offered. The event is designed to not just give volunteers a chance to get out and do something good for the community but to connect people willing to volunteer with organizations that need volunteers. While many of the projects are normally indoors with colleagues working closely, this year more of the events are being done online and outdoors, charity officials said. \u201cSome volunteers are offering software training and other services this year that can be done virtually,\u201d Emerson explained. \u201cThere is some mentoring and training being done virtually and the traditional projects are being done outside.\u201d Emerson said the change not only helps nonprofits in slightly different ways, but still allows volunteers to help who otherwise may not be able to participate in the Day of Caring. \u201cA lot of people are working from home and others are not going out as much and this allows them to participate,\u201d she said. \u201cThe people who love to get out and down and dirty can still do that.\u201d The Charlottesville-Albemarle Technical Education Center, known as CATEC, got a hand from 15 employees of Management Services Corporation who helped the school complete its indoor-outdoor classroom space. Last year, before COVID-19 closed school, CATEC officials gathered materials including wood for picnic tables, dirt, mulch, a hydroponic system, seed starter kits, and pots for the project. Culinary Arts students receive training on how to use the systems, practice planting and growing and use the produce for cooking lessons. \u201cMSC has always been a big fan of CATEC\u2019s education and support of a local, skilled labor force. We look forward to spending the Day of Caring at CATEC and working hard on projects that further their mission,\u201d said Steve Houchens, MSC vice president. The Day of Caring was sponsored this year by the University of Virginia, which has traditionally provided hundreds of volunteers for the day. The sponsorship, officials said, strengthens ties between the university and the community. \u201cIt\u2019s important that UVa not be set apart. As a part of this community we want to work hard to be a positive contributor to the fabric of Charlottesville,\u201d said Louis Nelson, vice provost for Academic Outreach and a professor of architectural history. \u201cWe\u2019re proud to support the United Way in their recognition and promotion of services, especially in these extraordinary times.\u201d The charity also created the Caring for Community Awards presented to a dozen organizations and people at the breakfast to honor volunteer efforts. \u201cWe thought it was important to do something special for the community this fall, especially to try and shine a light on those who went above and beyond in response to the pandemic,\u201d said Emerson. \u201cWe are not devaluing the hard work done by others in our community, nor are we turning service into a popularity contest. We are merely working to shine a light on those who, as voted by their fellow community members, deserve a bit of extra recognition for their generosity.\u201d The awards were given to members of the faith community, local government, nonprofits, medical caregivers and others who have contributed to the community. Winners of the inaugural Above and Beyond awards were Siri Russell, Charlottesville Community Cares; Cville Craft Aid; Commonwise Home Care; All Blessings Flow; Keevil & Keevil Grocery and Kitchen; Brassiere Saison; Hospice of the Piedmont; Faith Christian Academy; Dr. Taison Bell; Heather Kellams; and Charles \u201cAlex-Zan\u201d Alexander","197":"RICHMOND\u00a0\u2014 The Virginia Department of Health reported Wednesday a total of 122,542 COVID-19 cases - a 927-case jump from Tuesday.

According to a news release, voluntary asymptomatic testing will be offered on a limited, first-come, first-served basis and is not mandatory. UVa is offering self-administered test kits to asymptomatic faculty and staff in its academic division, and to contracted workers. UVa Medical Center and University Physicians Group employees will be able to register for asymptomatic testing appointments at a satellite UVa Health COVID-19 testing site. \u201cTesting for COVID-19 is part of our broader approach to promote the health and safety of our community,\u201d Dr. Mitch Rosner, the chair of the Department of Medicine who is involved in planning UVa\u2019s COVID-19 response, said in a statement. \u201cWe recognize that there are many reasons why a person may want or need testing, and thus we have developed pathways for asymptomatic people to get checked for COVID-19.\u201d Full-time, benefits-eligible faculty and staff, including those working in the schools of Medicine and Nursing, who are working on Grounds may order a free self-administered COVID-19 test from Let\u2019s Get Checked, the same vendor that is managing COVID-19 testing for returning students. The university has said that staff should not request a test if they are not currently working on Grounds or do not plan to work on Grounds this fall. Once the weekly allocation of kits is reached, orders will not be accepted until additional kits are made available the following week. A UVa spokesman said that no additional Let\u2019s Get Checked coronavirus tests have been purchased beyond the 27,000 test that were purchased to use before and during the school year. Employees with Aramark, BMS, Bright Horizons, Crothall, Exela, KinderCare, Morrison\/Compass, RMC and Towne Park were notified by those companies about how they can schedule an on-Grounds pick-up of a free Let\u2019s Get Checked test kit. Medical Center team members, School of Medicine faculty with clinical privileges, residents, fellows and University Physicians Group team members will be able to register for free asymptomatic testing appointments at a UVa Health satellite testing clinic at the Student Activities Building. Appointments are required and are limited to 50 per day. Tests will be processed by the UVa Health Medical Labs and results will be available in 24 to 48 hours. After a Daily Progress article about supply chain issues allowing UVa to run about 750 tests per day, UVa said labs are currently running only 300 to 400 tests per day, but currently have a capacity to run about 750. \u201cWe feel confident that we have, right now, the capacity to absorb several hundred more tests per day,\u201d said Dr. Christopher Moskaluk, the chair of the UVa Department of Pathology and physician lead of the Pathology & Medical Laboratory Service Line. UVa is supposed to get another instrument in the coming weeks that would be able to be used by the end of the month, he said, and is actively recruiting and hiring lab positions. \u201cIn the September time-frame is both that instrument and an increase in people that will help us get our capacity up to 1,500 [tests] and that\u2019d be a really large increase in what we\u2019re doing right now,\u201d Moskaluk said. \u201cSo, again, I think we\u2019d be able to handle if there\u2019s a large increase in symptomatic people or an outbreak of COVID.\u201d UVa Health is testing symptomatic patients at its clinics and emergency room, running community testing events, testing during some local outbreaks and testing for the athletic departments at UVa and at James Madison University. Moskaluck said that UVa is \u201cnot the only game in town\u201d doing testing \u2014 the Thomas Jefferson Health District is also offering testing, as are other doctors and clinics. The University is the largest employer in the Metropolitan Statistical Area, which covers Albemarle, Fluvanna, Greene and Nelson counties and the city of Charlottesville, according to the Virginia Employment Commission. The UVa Physicians Group is the fourth largest employer. He said that the university is working to preorder enough tests to have about a month\u2019s supply, or about 40,000 tests, on hand. When asked why the university isn\u2019t doing more testing, Moskaluck said it\u2019s following Centers for Disease Control guidelines and focusing on symptomatic people. \u201cWe obviously don\u2019t have enough tests to test everybody in the Charlottesville\/Albemarle community whenever they wanted,\u201d he said. \u201cEven if we did something like that, we would just add to the national shortage of supply, so we\u2019re trying to be good stewards. And in part, we are actually going to be ramping up the number of people that are being tested in UVa Medical labs because as the students come in, we expect that there is going to be an uptick in the requirement to test asymptomatic people, either by contact tracing or a general surveillance strategy.\u201d","199":"RICHMOND\u00a0\u2014 The Virginia Department of Health reported Thursday a total of 123,668 COVID cases\u00a0\u2014 a 1,126-case jump from Wednesday.

The students are moving in at staggered dates and times in a bid by the university to reduce human contact and the potential spread of COVID-19. Masks were required during the move-in process and all students living in university housing will be required to agree to follow UVa\u2019s COVID-19 policy. Approximately 676 students were expected to move in between 4 and 8 p.m. Thursday, with another 688 expected Friday and 1,510 on Saturday. Along with boxes, pillows, bookcases and other belongings, move-in was marked by masks and boxes of disinfectant spray serving as reminders of the new reality. Despite the pandemic, some students and their families said they were hopeful move-in marked the start of a successful, albeit abnormal, semester. Kyle Stephenson Jr., a first-year student who plans to major in history, said he appreciated the empty hallways and that the move-in process had gone smoothly for him so far. Stephenson said many of his classes and activities are remote, including marching band, but he also will have some in-person classes. Acknowledging the inherent risk of in-person classes, he said he was hopeful the semester would go well and that students would take their health seriously. \u201cI\u2019m kind of sitting in the middle because although you hear horror stories about all the other schools, we\u2019ve got a fantastic hospital and our pre-testing with quick results,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I\u2019m really hoping we can get this all taken care of.\u201d Stephenson\u2019s father said he isn\u2019t too worried about this semester, so long as the students and staff take necessary safety precautions. \u201cI\u2019m excited because this is the opportunity that we all want our children to be exposed to \u2014 attending an incredible university and graduating,\u201d Kyle Stephenson Sr. said. \u201cThis is, hopefully, the beginning of how life is supposed to go, with kids going away and developing and growing.\u201d With UVa having started classes online Aug. 25, Jade Alvarez, a first-year student from Richmond, said she already had assignments due. Like many other first-years, Alvarez said all of her classes will remain online this semester. \u201cIt feels weird and there\u2019s a lot of information coming in about when to move in and how to take safety precautions, but I\u2019m excited,\u201d she said. As Chanlee Hudson and her family stood with her belongings, the first-year student shared that she was nervous to begin the year but hopes she\u2019ll be able to stay at UVa for the whole semester. Like many of the other first-years moving in Thursday, Hudson said she had not yet met her roommate in person. As part of UVa\u2019s effort to socially distance, roommates were discouraged from moving in at the same time. Though the students and their families were optimistic about the semester, some members of UVa and wider Charlottesville-area communities have expressed trepidation with the school\u2019s decision to hold in-person instruction. On Wednesday, student members of the UVa Youth Democratic Socialists of America staged a \u201cdie-in\u201d on the Lawn to draw attention to their demands, chanting \u201cno acceptable losses, no in-person classes.\u201d Their demands include the cessation of in-person instruction, which is set to begin Tuesday; a tuition freeze; and free health care for COVID-19-related illness. The decision to hold in-person instruction also led in part to various UVa employees announcing their intention to unionize. The group of employees currently is mostly made up of graduate student workers. The union, which would be part of United Campus Workers, also would include undergraduate student workers, faculty and staff, including those in the UVa Health System. State law bars the university from recognizing the union but doesn\u2019t prevent employees from organizing. Speaking on her own behalf, Charlottesville City Councilor Sena Magill said in an interview Thursday that she is concerned about UVa holding in-person classes and views the decision as a mistake. Frontal lobes of human brains do not fully finish developing until about age 26, and as this part of the brain is responsible for judgment, Magill said she is concerned the young students may push the boundaries of safe practices. \u201cI see other universities deciding to go all virtual after bringing their students back and am concerned we will face this same issue here,\u201d she said. \u201cI am worried for the people working in grocery stores, in our restaurants, and other essential workers who will now be exposed to an influx of people from across the country who may not be practicing precautions as stringently as we have been.\u201d Magill said she believes the city and the university are equipped to handle a certain level of outbreaks but she is worried about the capacity to deal with outbreaks that could occur not just among students but among the larger community, as well. None of the other city council members returned requests for comment, though Mayor Nikuyah Walker previously has described UVa\u2019s reopening plan as a \u201crecipe for disaster.\u201d Some other colleges in Virginia already have made the switch to remote instruction following outbreaks. This week, James Madison University announced it would to transition to online classes after 528 COVID-19 cases were reported on campus. School officials gave some 6,000 students living on campus until Monday to move out. Virginia colleges reported more than 1,400 coronavirus cases as of Tuesday. The 528 at JMU are the most in the state.","201":"The University of Virginia announced expanded coronavirus testing measures Friday ahead of next week\u2019s planned start of in-person classes. To slow the spread of the virus locally, university officials announced Friday that they will start conducting testing of asymptomatic students, saliva screenings and wastewater analysis. As of Friday, the university reported 201 positive cases, including 161 students. UVa has drawn criticism for continuing forward with in-person instruction as other schools across the state and country have opted to hold virtual classes for the semester. Some students have called for in-person classes to stop and various UVa employees have announced their intention to unionize in response to the plan. Starting after Labor Day, UVa will notify a number of students each day that they have been selected to provide testing samples so that officials can monitor the prevalence of asymptomatic students. The tests will be mandatory. UVa plans to launch a program that will use saliva samples to quickly screen large numbers of students over the course of the semester. Students will be able to stop by multiple screening locations on Grounds and results will be provided quickly, often on the same day. Officials will also test wastewater at residence halls for the presence of the virus with the help of the Virginia Department of Health. If wastewater samples indicate new infections are present in a particular building, the university will test all the students in the residence hall. Last month, officials at the University of Arizona found students who tested positive for COVID-19 but were asymptomatic after testing wastewater from residence halls, the Arizona Republic reported. At least two students were isolated after the findings, and the university credited the testing with stemming a larger outbreak. \u201cOur goals with expanded testing are to be able to rapidly identify infections and be able to isolate infected individuals with the aim of limiting transmission,\u201d Mitch Rosner, chair of the Department of Medicine, said in a news release. \u201cThe team at UVA Medical Labs are real heroes for their round-the-clock efforts to support these initiatives.\u201d Officials in the release touted other measures that have been taken before students arrived in the area, including pre-arrival testing. Earlier this week, the university announced it will provide testing to asymptomatic employees. A UVa spokesman said this week that no additional coronavirus tests have been purchased beyond the 27,000 tests that were bought for use before and during the school year.","202":"RICHMOND \u2014 While the Virginia Department of Health reported a 1,111-case jump on Friday \u2014 marking a total of 124,779 COVID-19 cases \u2014 current hospitalizations statewide are decreasing.

There are 858 total outbreaks across Virginia, which make up 18,006 of the state\u2019s cases. 7,051 cases have been reported in the state\u2019s healthcare workers. Locally, there have been 27 reported outbreaks: 13 in long-term care facilities, eight in congregate settings, three in correctional facilities, two in educational settings and one in a healthcare setting. There have been 466 outbreak-associated cases reported across the health district, while 185 cases have been reported in the region\u2019s healthcare workers.","203":"As the Charlottesville school division prepares for a virtual start Tuesday, officials are starting to eye the next big decision \u2014 what will learning look like in the second quarter? When the School Board decided in July to start with all-virtual classes for the first nine weeks, school officials didn\u2019t outline a plan for the following quarters. Now, a community advisory committee made up of public health officials, medical professionals, teachers, parents and others will review local data about COVID-19, state and federal guidance and other factors, such as the division\u2019s ability to transport students to school, in order to make a recommendation. Schools Superintendent Rosa Atkins said at Thursday\u2019s School Board meeting that the committee could recommend continuing virtual learning or propose a hybrid model. The division had proposed two different hybrid options this summer \u2014 one with two days of in-person classes for all students and one with four days of in-person classes for elementary students and two days for the higher grades. \u201cSo what we need to do in this community is to use the wisdom of many different groups to help us determine when we can safely return students to school and in what method,\u201d said Beth Baptist, the division\u2019s coordinator of career and technical education and special projects. \u201cWe know we would like to have the hybrid model and that\u2019s what we\u2019re moving toward, but one of the big questions is when we can do that.\u201d Those interested in serving on the committee should apply at charlottesvilleschools.org\/committees by Wednesday. The division wants to convene the first meeting by Sept. 24 with a report to the School Board by Oct. 1 and Nov. 5, if needed. The committee was one of three superintendent advisory panels detailed Thursday. The other two will focus on school security and reviewing building names. More information and applications for those committees also are available at charlottesvilleschools.org\/committees. When school starts Tuesday, those in division buildings, including children and staff in child care programs, will be required to wear masks or an acceptable face covering, according to the policy the School Board approved. The mask policy mirrors what the Albemarle County School Board adopted last month. Also during Thursday\u2019s meeting, Baptist, who is working with the Thomas Jefferson Health District, reviewed the latest COVID-19 case numbers with the board. As of Aug. 31, the city\u2019s percent of positive cases was at 9.7%, up from 3.8% the week before. Those numbers were available through a Virginia Department of Health dashboard, which is not accessible to the public. A VDH spokeswoman said last month that the department did not intend to make the dashboard public. \u201cUntil we are at a sustained 5%, I\u2019m going to be reluctant to go back,\u201d School Board Chairwoman Jennifer McKeever said. \u201cIt\u2019s a baseline. To me, a pretty high baseline. These ups and downs are just not where I feel comfortable at sending my children, your children and our staff.\u201d The health district\u2019s percent positive rate for Aug. 31 was 7.3% after eight days of consecutive increases. Over the last month, the positive rate has fluctuated while slowly inching up after hitting a low of 5% on Aug. 6. In Charlottesville, cases climbed sharply in the last week of August after nearly a month of relatively flat day-to-day increases. As of Friday, the seven-day average of daily case increases stood at 19. \u201cAt this point, I\u2019m not going to let us just accept the argument that it\u2019s not all [University of Virginia] students because that is literally the only thing that\u2019s changed over the past two weeks,\u201d McKeever said. McKeever and other board members also wanted to know how exactly UVa students will be included in the district\u2019s case numbers. The university is tracking positive cases identified through Student Health and Wellness or a UVa clinic on its own dashboard. On Friday, UVa reported an additional 27 positive cases, with students accounting for 26 of them. Since Aug. 17, 161 students have tested positive and the university has reported a total of 201 cases. Kathryn Goodman, spokeswoman for the health district, said they are working on processes to ensure that the case numbers reflect what\u2019s happening in the community regarding the virus\u2019 spread. Safety and security Following the board\u2019s decision in June to end the school resource officer program, a safety and security committee resources committee will be convened to make recommendations for a new safety model. The deadline for applications is Sept. 15 and recommendations from the panel are due to the School Board by Nov. 5. Board members encouraged Atkins to ensure that the committee would reflect a broad cross-section of the community and questioned whether the Charlottesville Police Department needed to be included. \u201cThe school resource officers are people that [teachers and students] have a strong relationship with, and they have been in their buildings for a number of years,\u201d Atkins said. \u201cThey provide valuable service to our students, to our teachers and to our community. Yes, it is time for us to take a critical look at the relationship and the [memorandum of understanding] \u2014 no question about that. But we have our resource officers who have developed meaningful relationships with staff and students, and those are people that we would want to hear from as we have this discussion.\u201d LaShundra Bryson Morsberger and other board members expressed concerns that having a CPD representative on the committee would stifle discussion and prevent the division from creating a new model. \u201c... I would like to push back on the idea that there has to be a Charlottesville Police Department member on the committee, because there\u2019s been so much outcry and so much pushback and it\u2019s a delicate topic,\u201d Morsberger said. \u201cMaybe we should start off from a clean slate and not from how the CPD would handle it.\u201d McKeever said the board wants to move beyond the SRO model. \u201cI fear that if you have [a law enforcement officer] at the table, it\u2019s just different if you don\u2019t,\u201d she said. \u201cThey look at the world very differently. With all due respect to their relationships, they\u2019ve also created real concern in the buildings, as well.\u201d The committee also will include parents, students, teachers and principals in addition to UVa representatives, psychologists, social workers and community business partners. The first meeting is planned for Sept. 30 with work sessions during October before a recommendation is made to the School Board in November. When the board ended the current program, division staffers said they would schedule a series of feedback sessions to inform a draft of a new model. Officials did want the new model to be in place by early August, but planning for the fall semester and switching to online classes changed the timeline. Building names After many calls over the years for the division to review its school names, an advisory committee will begin that process. As part of that effort, the School Board approved a policy change Thursday, giving the board the authority to rename buildings. Interested community members, students, parents and teachers should apply by Sept. 23. Subcommittees will be convened for each school to give input on the naming review. \u201cWe know that there has been some talk in the community about looking at the names of our buildings, and whether we should look at renaming any of them,\u201d Baptist said. \u201cWe know that this has occurred in lots of different places around us and throughout the country. So we want to make sure that we are also doing due diligence and meeting the core values of the area by looking at the names of our schools to see if there needs to be any change.\u201d As opposed to the Albemarle County school division, which is taking a school-by-school approach to reviewing names, the city division is planning for the central advisory committee to make one recommendation to encompass all of the buildings. The division\u2019s 10 schools have 13 namesakes, some of whom have ties to either the Confederacy, the United Daughters of the Confederacy or segregated schools, according to an analysis by community historian Phil Varner. The committee\u2019s first meeting will be Oct. 15, according to a timeline presented Thursday. By Jan. 7, it is expected to provide a report to the School Board.","204":"Last week, as students moved into university housing, officials clarified the limits on gatherings and how mask requirements and other coronavirus-related restrictions would be enforced, and they announced random, mandatory COVID-19 testing for students. \u201cSo what we are trying to do is ensure that our students, faculty and staff are safe,\u201d UVa President Jim Ryan said in an interview last week. \u201cAnd one of the ways to do that, I think, is to ensure that our students feel like they\u2019re still a part of the UVa community. I will say I\u2019ve been heartened so far. If you walk around, students are taking it seriously, and that\u2019s a good thing. This is a hard thing for everyone, and it\u2019s gonna require everyone doing their part.\u201d In-person classes at UVa begin Tuesday, more than six months after officials suspended classes and sent students home in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. As UVa is set to start the fall semester in-person, the spread of the virus locally is not under control. The number of cases and the positivity rates have climbed recently in Charlottesville \u2014 a trend some in the community fear will be exacerbated by the recent return of students. In the last month, universities that decided to hold in-person classes and bring students back to the dorms have seen hundreds of positive cases among students with some, such as the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, deciding to switch classes online. Last week, James Madison University temporarily moved courses online and told students to go home for a few weeks in response to a surge of cases after less than a week of classes. As of Monday, there were 227 positive cases at UVa, with students accounting for 186 of those, according to the university\u2019s virus dashboard. Meanwhile, thousands of students in local public schools are starting the school year Tuesday with online classes. Ryan said every institution has to come to its own decision. \u201cI don\u2019t think there are any obviously right ways to go about this,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cI totally respect what the K-12 schools are doing, but we\u2019ve chosen a different path, and part of the reason we did, honestly, is we knew that students would be back.\u201d That\u2019s why Ryan said that UVa\u2019s decision to hold in-person classes is a red herring. \u201cWhether we have classes online, all online or not, there would be 12[,000] to 15,000 students here in Charlottesville, regardless,\u201d he said, echoing a point he has made in recent weeks. \u201c... So then the question is, well, what is the best thing to do given that students are going to be here? I feel like if we just put a closed sign on the university, and there were thousands of students here, it would be much harder for them to feel like they\u2019re part of the community and maybe reduce their motivation to look out for themselves and look out for each other.\u201d Students had the option to take classes online from home, and UVa doesn\u2019t yet know how many undergraduates will be in Charlottesville for the fall semester. The semester started online Aug. 18. Lectures and classes that normally have a large student audience will be held online for the whole semester. A small number of clinical or practicum courses are offered only in-person. Students in graduate and professional programs started in-person classes last month. Students wanting to come to Charlottesville were required to submit a negative COVID-19 test in advance. Of those 18,122 screening tests, 65 were positive. The screening tests have not proven to be a silver bullet. At the University of Notre Dame, 99.7% of the tests were negative, but officials there still decided to suspend classes for two weeks after 222 confirmed cases. Notre Dame and other universities that have tried to reopen for students have provided insights for UVa officials about how to prepare. \u201cOne thing we have learned is that it\u2019s really important to have a good testing protocol in place, and it\u2019s really important to make sure that you have a lot of space for quarantining and isolating students, and that the quicker you can respond to outbreaks, the more likely it is that you can contain them.\u201d The university recently increased the number of rooms for quarantine and isolation to 1,500 and boosted efforts to test students and employees for the virus. \u201cBut the other thing you know, honestly, is that you have to be willing to adapt,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cThis virus remains unpredictable, and when it gets started, it can move really quickly. \u2026 It really is all about trying to stay one step ahead.\u201d Ryan didn\u2019t share a specific threshold for cases, hospitalizations or deaths that would force UVa to change course. However, officials are monitoring different factors, from the number of positive cases to the use of isolation and quarantine space. As of Monday, 4% of the quarantine and isolation rooms were in use. \u201cYou can\u2019t pinpoint one because a lot of it depends on the interaction,\u201d he said. \u201c\u2026 If you have a lot of isolation and quarantine space, you can handle a lot of cases. If you\u2019re running out of isolation and quarantine space, then you can\u2019t handle a lot of cases.\u201d He added that they are making sure they have enough testing capacity and keeping an eye on hospitalizations rates. The university has purchased 27,000 tests from a third-party company, and the UVa Medical Center is hoping to receive an additional machine this month that will allow it to process 1,500 tests a day \u2014 up from about 300 to 400 right now. \u201cIf it looks like the system is going to be overloaded or we have to prevent the system from overloading, that\u2019s when you need to reassess,\u201d Ryan said. Officials first announced plans for the fall semester in June and outlined a host of strategies to slow or prevent the spread of the virus among students, faculty and staff, including reducing the capacity of dorms and developing a health screening app. In early August, the university delayed the start of in-person classes, citing a concerning trend in the virus\u2019 prevalence rate, as well as testing supply chain issues. Officials decided Aug. 28 to continue with the plan for the fall semester. \u201cWe wanted to make sure that both were moving in the right direction, and they were,\u201d Ryan said of the decision to continue with the current plan. \u201cThat made us as confident as we could be. You always have to be humble with this virus about moving forward.\u201d One strategy other college communities have sought is to seek to have bars close earlier. For example, in Columbia, Missouri, bars and restaurants were ordered to stop serving alcohol by 9 p.m. after the area saw a spike in COVID-19 cases. \u201cWe\u2019re in active conversations about that,\u201d Ryan said. The university is requiring students to wear masks on and off Grounds when they are outside their residence and can\u2019t stay six feet away from others. Gatherings are limited to a maximum of 15 people. Those who don\u2019t comply could face suspension, the university has said \u2014 a message that other universities also have sent as they seek to control the virus\u2019 spread. UVa has set up reporting tools for students and community members who spot compliance issues. If a student tests positive for the virus, they will be contacted by a contact tracer through the Thomas Jefferson Health District. Ryan said information shared with contact tracers will not be used for enforcement. \u201cWhat we do not want is students feeling like they can\u2019t cooperate with contact tracing or that they\u2019re not going to get tested in the UVa system,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know that makes it worse for everyone.\u201d Still, UVa\u2019s decision to hold in-person classes and house students on Grounds has been met with skepticism and opposition from some university groups and community members. UVa\u2019s Student Council Executive Board opposed the move, and employees are seeking to form a union, in part to advocate for classes to remain online. The Cavalier Daily published an editorial warning against the risk to health and lives it says comes with the university\u2019s in-person plans. \u201cWe are worried for the health and safety of the University\u2019s employees who will be forced to work in an environment with students who continue to go to parties and bars,\u201d the newspaper wrote. \u201cWe are worried for the community members that will be forced to take extra safety precautions due to the inevitable spike in cases that Charlottesville will soon see. We are worried for the students who will find themselves sick just because they showed up to class.\u201d Ryan said that if UVa closed the dorms, students would just move into the Charlottesville community. \u201cWe saw this with second-, third- and fourth-year students when we announced the delay,\u201d he said. \u201cAbout 800 or 900 students dropped their on-Grounds housing contracts, and most of them moved into the Charlottesville community, which I don\u2019t think makes them safer or the Charlottesville community safer.\u201d","205":"RICHMOND \u2014 Though the federal government is asking states to prepare for the possibility of a COVID-19 vaccine within months, some Virginians differ on whether the vaccine should be mandatory when it becomes available. Virginia Freedom Keepers, a nonprofit that advocates for medical freedom, gathered in Richmond last week for a March Against Mandates, in protest of the statewide mask mandate, as well as a potential COVID-19 vaccine mandate. The Virginia General Assembly is currently holding a special session to discuss, among other items, COVID-19-related measures. Virginia Health Commissioner Dr. Norman Oliver said in a recent interview with WRIC-TV that if he is still Virginia\u2019s health commissioner when a COVID-19 vaccine is made available, he will make immunization mandatory. \u201cIt is killing people now. We don\u2019t have a treatment for it and if we develop a vaccine that can prevent it from spreading in the community, we will save hundreds and hundreds of lives,\u201d Oliver said. Gov. Ralph Northam\u2019s office, however, did not back up the health commissioner\u2019s statement. Northam\u2019s administration told WRIC it had \u201ctaken no official policy position on whether or not a COVID-19 vaccine for adults should be mandatory.\u201d Northam\u2019s office did not respond to a request for comment for this story. According to the Virginia Department of Health press office, when Oliver spoke in support of a mandate for a future COVID-19 vaccine, he was \u201csharing his personal opinion as a physician.\u201d Virginia law currently gives the health commissioner the authority to issue a mandate for a vaccine in the case of an epidemic. The law allows doctors to exempt people from vaccination if their health would be negatively affected. A.E. Dick Howard, a professor of international law at the University of Virginia, says this statute must be read in light of the state constitution, which states the commonwealth\u2019s executive power is vested in the governor, meaning it\u2019s unlikely that Oliver would have the final word. \u201cThis provision is meant to focus both authority and responsibility of the governor. It therefore argues against the splintering of authority in the executive branch,\u201d Howard said in an email. The current language exempts those with a note written by a doctor, but two Virginia delegates wanted to exempt people who object to vaccination on religious grounds. HB 5070, introduced by Del. Dave LaRock, R-Loudoun, and HB 5016, introduced by Del. Mark Cole, R-Fredericksburg, have similar wording. The two bills, which were tabled during the special session, would have eliminated the health commissioner\u2019s authority to enforce a vaccination mandate for people who object due to religious beliefs. \u201cI am concerned that there is such a rush to develop a vaccine for COVID-19 that normal safety and effectiveness testing may be bypassed, leading to the distribution of a vaccine that has not been fully tested,\u201d Cole said in an email. \u201cWho knows what the health consequences of short-circuiting the process may be?\u201d LaRock did not respond to a request for comment about his bill. Cole said constituents concerned about a mandatory vaccine asked him to introduce HB 5016, and that \u201creligious beliefs\u201d in the bill incorporates any belief system, including secularism. \u201cI am old enough to remember the swine flu scare more than 40 years ago. President Ford started a program of public vaccinations to protect people from it,\u201d Cole said. \u201cI received the vaccine when I was in college.\u201d In 1976, a swine flu outbreak in New Jersey led President Gerald Ford to issue a nationwide immunization program. Of the 40 million Americans who received the vaccine, about 500 are suspected to have contracted Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, a disorder that damages nerve cells and causes paralysis in some cases. \u201cNo one should be forced to take a vaccine. Every vaccine has some health risks associated with it; they may be relatively minor, but they are there,\u201d Cole said. \u201cVaccines that have been tested and found to be effective and safe should be offered to the public, and I am confident that most people will take advantage of it, including myself.\u201d In 1905, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled states have the authority to regulate for the protection of the public and a community has the right to protect itself against an \u201cepidemic of disease,\u201d regardless of one\u2019s political or religious objections, according to the National Constitution Center. The ruling allowed the city of Cambridge, Massachusetts, to fine residents who refused to receive smallpox injections. According to Howard, in the case of a mandatory vaccine, the court ruled that states may create an exemption based on religion but are not obliged to do so. \u201cThus, the question of what qualifies as a religious exemption depends on how a statute is drafted and interpreted,\u201d Howard said.","206":null,"207":"RICHMOND \u2014 The Virginia Department of Health reported Tuesday a total of 128,407 COVID-19 cases in the state \u2014 a 836-case jump from Monday and a 6,792 case increase from a week ago.

The City Council accepted his resignation effective Sept. 30 during a special meeting Friday. City Attorney John Blair has been appointed interim city manager and Deputy City Attorney Lisa Robertson will be acting city attorney. \u201cI\u2019d like to thank the council for the honor to serve as a temporary bridge until we get a new city manager hired for Charlottesville,\u201d Blair said. \u201cThe one thing I would like to say personally is that I deeply believe that this city and its residents, its council and its workforce can work together and we can make this city a more just, fair, equitable and prosperous place.\u201d Blair will take over as interim city manager on Oct. 1, but Mayor Nikuyah Walker said he will immediately start working with Richardson on the transition. Blair and Robertson signed agreements that provide a 10% pay raise for the duration of their interim duties. Richardson said he was resigning for personal reasons and cited ongoing stress from the pandemic and protests around the death of George Floyd, although all recent protests in the city have been peaceful. \u201cIt just was time,\u201d he said. \u201cWe worked through COVID, which took up a lot of time. We worked a lot of hours and then from that with the untimely death of George Floyd we started having a lot of protests in the city.\u201d Richardson said he has no plans right now and, \u201cAs I\u2019ve told everyone, I just want to get some sleep.\u201d According to a resolution passed at the meeting, the decision was mutual. Richardson\u2019s administration has been marked by spats with city staff, elected officials and local activists. During the budget process late last year, school officials had to scramble when they learned they would be getting significantly less than expected. Planning Commissioners were irritated that they weren\u2019t included in the process for the Capital Improvement Program. Richardson also appeared to delay the promotion of a firefighter at the center of a budget battle before later approving it. He also drew ire from activists when incorrectly citing a policy allowing residents to request cameras be placed throughout the city for law enforcement. In his 16-month tenure, city leadership has been gutted of longtime employees. He has also run afoul of activists and officials from other governments while butting heads with the City Council in the early days of the pandemic. Per his contract, Richardson is entitled to a lump sum payment of $205,000, the equivalent of one year\u2019s salary. If he had been terminated before clearing a performance evaluation in December, his contract would only allow for six months of pay. Richardson will also receive payment for unused leave. He will continue to receive city contributions toward his health insurance for one year, unless he starts another job in that time. The resignation comes at a key moment in the coronavirus pandemic as University of Virginia students are back in class and the virus continues to spread. As of Friday, the Thomas Jefferson Health District reported 2,796 cases of the virus with 176 hospitalizations and 58 deaths. Of those, 867 cases are in the city with 27 hospitalizations and 24 deaths. On Thursday, UVa reported 282 cases, of which 238 are students. Over the past year, council has met for more than 24 hours in numerous closed sessions to discuss Richardson\u2019s performance since the fall, including a four-hour meeting in October that followed a rescinded request for proposals regarding a planned consolidation of city and school administrative offices. The first sign of discontent came as former Deputy City Manager Mike Murphy and Richardson butted heads behind closed doors before Murphy\u2019s abrupt resignation at the end of 2019. Murphy reportedly penned a four-page memo with allegations of misconduct and mismanagement toward Richardson prior to his departure, but the city has withheld the memo and those who have seen it remain tight-lipped about its contents. When asked about the memo in December, Murphy declined to comment. When asked about it Friday, Walker said \u201cThat period in the city is in our history and we would like to keep it that way. Those matters have already been addressed.\u201d The council also met for nearly 11 hours to discuss Richardson at a closed session in June, during which Fire Chief Andrew Baxter resigned over disputes with him. Baxter blamed Richardson\u2019s management style for the numerous departures in city leadership in a March email, obtained by The Daily Progress via a request under the Virginia Freedom of Information Act. \u201cI believe in my heart that it [is] this specific type of behavior that has led to a steady loss of experienced leaders since Richardson\u2019s arrival last May,\u201d he wrote. \u201c[A]nd, if left unchecked, will ultimately drive our City government toward a state of mediocrity never before encountered in this caring, dynamic resource-rich community.\u201d Murphy was interim city manager until Richardson started, replacing City Manager Maurice Jones, who left in July 2018 to become town manager of Chapel Hill, North Carolina. Two months earlier, City Council announced it would not renew his contract. Murphy remains on the city\u2019s payroll through Oct. 31 under the terms of his contract as interim city manager. Walker said the city plans to again hire a consulting firm to lead the search for a new city manager. She said the council hasn\u2019t determined if it will do a similar public interview process, but \u201cit would be in everyone\u2019s best interest\u201d to gather input from the public and city staff. Walker said high turnover rates among city staff are a concern and she can\u2019t say if it will affect hiring a new administrative head. \u201cAll of us are concerned about those high turnover rates,\u201d she said. \u201cThe goal is to stabilize the organizations. I think if you pay attention to the election cycles, the goal for every council member at this time is to create a thriving community and to do that we will need a stable organization. So yes, it is concerning to us and it\u2019s a goal to repair it.\u201d","211":"RICHMOND\u00a0\u2014 The Virginia Department of Health reported Friday that the statewide total for COVID-19 cases is 131,640 \u2014 an increase of 1,115 from the 130,525 reported Thursday.

U.S. News & World Report placed UVa at No. 26 in its annual rankings of American universities released Monday. UVa was at No. 28 last year following several years of ranking No. 25. Out of the country\u2019s public colleges, UVa stayed at No. 4, behind the University of California-Los Angeles, the University of California-Berkeley and the University of Michigan-Ann Arbor. In the 2018 rankings, UVa was the second-best public university in the country. In the 2017 and 2019 editions, UVa ranked No. 3. U.S. News tinkered with its methodology this year to take into account issues directly affecting students and families such as student debt and social mobility. Factors such as graduation and retention rates and social mobility are weighted heavily in the formula that determines the rankings, while weights for SAT and ACT scores, high school class standing and alumni giving were reduced. UVa students, on average, owe about $17,756 in federal loans, according U.S. News, which puts the university at No. 49 for students with the least debt at graduation. U.S. News weighs more than a dozen factors in determining a school\u2019s overall score. UVa finished with an overall score of 79, tying with Carnegie Mellon University in Pennsylvania. The rankings come as universities across the country are dealing with disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, which ended semesters early and has forced some colleges to send students home and shift to online classes. UVa started in-person classes last week. U.S. News said in a press release that it remains committed to providing information to help prospective students and their families understand their higher education options. \u201cThe pandemic has affected students across the country, canceling commencement ceremonies and switching classes from in-person to remote,\u201d Kim Castro, editor and chief content officer of U.S. News, said in the release. \u201cWhether students have slightly altered their college plans or changed them entirely, it remains our mission to continue providing students and their families with the tools they need to help find the right school for them.\u201d UVa was the top-ranked Virginia university. Among public universities, the College of William & Mary tied for No. 11, while Virginia Tech came in at No. 29, George Mason at No. 65 and Virginia Commonwealth University at No. 77.","213":"BreadWorks, a Charlottesville bakery staffed by people with disabilities, will close its doors this month because of a pandemic-related drop in business. The store\u2019s last day will be Sept. 25. The closing is due to a crash in catering contracts and walk-in traffic caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent restrictions, officials said. Officials with WorkSource Enterprises, which provides job training, employment and services to people with disabilities and runs the business, said the 26-year-old bakery no longer pays for itself. \u201cIt\u2019s incredibly difficult because it has been a labor of love,\u201d said Charles J. McElroy, WorkSource president. \u201cBreadWorks has had a loyal following and it was a difficult decision to make, but it was hemorrhaging financially and there was just no way to stop the bleeding.\u201d From opening as strictly a take-out bakery with minimalist d\u00e9cor in 1994 to expanding into coffee and ready-made sandwiches with a contemporary coffee shop vibe by 2019, BreadWorks seems like any other Charlottesville cafe. Pastries, breads, sandwiches and the bakery\u2019s signature cookies sit in display cases while an airpot of specially blended coffee begs for a customer\u2019s squeeze. The secret behind the storefront is the people behind the counter, running the ovens and creating the goods. From the scones to the soup, people with disabilities are involved in all aspects of the operation. McElroy said the bakery had a solid business catering to meetings for local governments and the University of Virginia. That ended when Virginia ordered all but essential businesses to close as COVID-19 hit the state. Area governments, businesses and UVa shut down most in-person operations and shifted meetings to virtual formats. \u201cWhen COVID hit in mid-March, the bottom just fell out,\u201d McElroy said. \u201cWe had a bunch of catering contracts and when the pandemic came, they were almost immediately canceled. We did curbside pickup and online ordering before we closed it down from April 17 to June 9. We just couldn\u2019t make a go of it.\u201d McElroy said the state going into Phase Three of reopening, allowing businesses to seat some customers and requiring facemasks and cleaning procedures, did not bring the business back. \u201cIt\u2019s been incredibly slow and unsustainable from a business standpoint,\u201d he said. \u201cThe catering orders we were accustomed to having just dried up.\u201d Customers leaving the BreadWorks counter one recent afternoon said they were disappointed. Many were coming back for their favorite cookies before the shop closes. \u201cThey have the best soft, chewy chocolate cookies,\u201d said one man who asked that his name not be used because, he said, \u201cI\u2019m on a diet.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m going to miss them.\u201d Dozens of people poured out sympathy and sadness at news of the closing on BreadWorks\u2019 Facebook page. \u201cI\u2019m so very sad to read this. I will miss your amazing food but also the wonderful people who have made it a special place to visit. You guys made Cville a better place,\u201d said Nancy Payne McCarthy in response to the post announcing the closing. \u201cMy heart is breaking,\u201d said Olivia Branch. \u201cIt\u2019s gratifying to read all of the comments on Facebook,\u201d McElroy said. \u201cIt\u2019s great to know you have done something that people love and care about.\u201d Employees at BreadWorks with disabilities will be referred to other WorkSource programs, officials said. The majority will be seeking work in the community, and McElroy encouraged interested employers to contact WorkSource. WorkSource serves people with intellectual and learning disabilities and mental illness, as well special education students and people with autism, sensory impairments and traumatic brain injuries. McElroy said the decision to close BreadWorks was tough, but final. \u201cIt\u2019s a competitive business to begin with,\u201d he said of food service and bakeries. \u201cWhen you throw in the COVID downturn on top of it, you have a difficult situation. We just couldn\u2019t make it. We\u2019re like a lot of other businesses in that respect.\u201d","214":"Nearly six months since the first COVID-19 case was reported in Charlottesville, the Thomas Jefferson Health District has redesigned its dashboard of case information and added more data points to help the public better understand the status of the pandemic locally. A big change in the district\u2019s new COVID-19 portal, unveiled Monday, is showing the dates when people tested positive or first developed symptoms, along with a seven-day moving average of new cases for the district by date of onset. Before, the district was reporting new cases based on when they were notified of a positive case. Information about cases based on the date of onset was only available at the statewide and health region levels. \u201cThat\u2019s really important and has never been shared before at a district level,\u201d said Guleer Shahab, a data analyst with the local health district who manages the data portal. \u201c\u2026 We added [the cases by date of onset] to give us a better idea of what happens daily. We wanted something more reliable and accurate.\u201d The revamped data portal now has five dashboards detailing information about cases, outbreaks and testing in the localities the district serves, including at the Albemarle-Charlottesville Regional Jail. As it has since the beginning of the pandemic, the district will continue to report new cases by the date the Virginia Department of Health was notified of a positive case. Those numbers are located in the \u201cLocalities\u201d dashboard. The Thomas Jefferson Health District includes the city of Charlottesville and the counties of Albemarle, Fluvanna, Greene, Louisa and Nelson. The district still counts its total cases using the report date data because data for the cases by onset date can be delayed for a day or two in order for the health district to gather the necessary information. Shahab said that though the community has closely followed the daily case totals, looking at the cases by date of onset is a more accurate representation of the trajectory of cases and better for reporting over time. As of Monday, the seven-day average for cases based on the date of onset, at 18.14, has declined in recent days. The average reached two high points over the summer \u2014 in mid-July at 31.29 cases and on Aug. 31 at 29.71. Shahab said that when the daily-case spikes influence the moving average, that\u2019s cause for alarm. \u201cThe seven-day moving average is helpful because we want to know where we stand and where the trajectory is heading,\u201d she said. The district also expanded the dashboard to include information about the type of facility reporting an outbreak, such as long-term care facilities and educational or other congregate settings. More detailed information about cases in long-term care facilities in the district \u2014 including the number of cases, hospitalizations and facilities \u2014 will continue to be included in the dashboard. Previously, as far as group residential settings, the dashboard only had information about cases in long-term care facilities. \u201cWe appreciate feedback and listen to all of it,\u201d Shahab said. All of the health district data does include all University of Virginia-affiliated cases for people living in the area, even if the address the person lists is outside of the health district, according to a news release from the TJHD. On Monday, UVa reported an additional 45 positive cases among students, bringing the total to 321 and making up 86% of the cases identified by Student Health & Wellness or a UVa clinic, according to the university\u2019s tracker. Eight percent of the university\u2019s quarantine rooms are occupied, along with 1% of its isolation rooms. UVa updates its tracker at 4 p.m. on weekdays while TJHD is updating the data portal at 10 a.m. seven days a week. Other changes to the health district dashboard include broadening the races and ethnicities reported for different cases. In the district, white people make up about 44% of all positive cases, Latinos account for 23.1% and African Americans comprise 16.7%. Yet, African Americans continue to be hospitalized at a higher rate, making up 37.8% of the 180 local hospitalizations. Data on hospitalizations comes from a person\u2019s status at the time the case was investigated by the health department, so it underrepresents the total number of people hospitalized for COVID-19 in the district. Monday\u2019s update has been in the works for a long time, Shahab said. \u201cWe continue to monitor data closely,\u201d she said. \u201cThe dashboard is constantly under progress as we work to make it more user-friendly and share more accurate and insightful data.\u201d Shahab said it\u2019s important for community members to not just look at one dataset but use all the information together. \u201cWe know community transmission is happening,\u201d she said, adding that folks should wash their hands, wear a mask and stay six feet away from others.","215":"The University of Virginia has identified a cluster of coronavirus cases in a residence hall and is mass testing students, according to a Wednesday tweet by the university.

Building residents were told to remain in their rooms except use the bathroom or retrieve meals until they receive test results. Those with positive tests, and anyone in close contact with those people, will be moved to quarantine rooms, the school said. On Wednesday, UVa reported 378 total cases, including 330 among students. Limited in-person classes began last week. University officials have said that they have been conducting testing of asymptomatic students, saliva screenings and wastewater analysis. \u201cUniversity leaders and public health experts have spent months planning for a return of students and a potential increase in cases,\u201d UVa spokesman Brian Coy said in a statement. \u201cWe continue to expand our testing capacity, add quarantine and isolation rooms as necessary, and monitor our overall capacity to respond to cases and limit the spread of the virus.\u201d Last month, officials at the University of Arizona found students who tested positive for COVID-19 but were asymptomatic after testing wastewater from residence halls, the Arizona Republic reported. At least two students were isolated after the findings, and the university credited the testing with stemming a larger outbreak.","216":"The University of Virginia is paying $177,533 to the Thomas Jefferson Health District to support seven new staff members who will be responsible for investigating all UVa-affiliated positive cases of COVID-19. The health district announced Thursday the details of a memorandum of understanding between UVa and the Virginia Department of Health that outlines the funding, guidelines for data sharing and how university staff will assist with the contact tracing process, among other provisions, according to a news release. TJHD spokeswoman Kathryn Goodman said the MOU, which was signed Aug. 24 and is effective through Dec. 31, solidifies a partnership with VDH, TJHD and UVa and comes as students officially returned to Grounds last week. \u201cWe would handle UVa cases anyways, as we manage all COVID cases in the community, but this allows for TJHD to hire additional staff to help specifically with UVa investigations\/contact tracing,\u201d she said. The team of case investigators and contact tracers supported by UVa funding will help manage positive cases related to UVa and its close contacts. The investigators who work directly with someone who tests positive will have information about quarantine and isolation resources at UVa and provide those recommendations about what a person should do. Goodman said the staff members have been hired and are currently in training. In the meantime, other health district staff members are handling the UVa-affiliated cases. The team will prioritize UVa cases but could handle others if the workload permits. TJHD has ramped up its contact tracing staff in recent months, standing at about 50 people now. On Thursday, UVa reported an additional 52 cases among students and that 15% of the on-Grounds quarantine housing was occupied while 1% of isolation rooms are in use. The university has about 1,500 beds for quarantine and isolation, which are available to students who live on Grounds. Those who do not live in university housing are encouraged to isolate or quarantine in their residences, return home or get a hotel room, according to university documents. Thursday\u2019s case increase was the largest since the university started its COVID-19 tracker Aug. 26. However, a spokesman said in a statement that a test processing machine was temporarily offline, which created a backlog of tests. \u201cThat issue has been resolved, as today\u2019s numbers reflect \u2014 the large number of cases include a number who were tested earlier in the week and do not represent a sudden spike over the last 24 hours,\u201d UVa spokesman Wes Hester said in a statement. \u201cAs our testing capacity expands, we expect to see an uptick in cases on Grounds and to adapt our response plan in order to limit the spread of the virus and keep our community healthy and safe.\u201d UVa has reported 430 cases overall, with 382 of those being students. An expanded COVID-19 tracker will be launched Friday. Thursday\u2019s case numbers do not include the results from the mass testing of students at the Balz-Dobie residence hall. The university announced Wednesday that it had identified five positive cases through wastewater and individual testing programs and would test all of dorm\u2019s 188 residents later that evening. The agreement also outlines how the health district and the university will securely share data about positive COVID test results. The health district will only share case information with the university if the individual consents, but the case numbers that the district reports do include those affiliated with UVa. Cases are assigned to the locality in which a person lives. For example, those at UVa who live in the dorms will be assigned to Albemarle County. Many in the community have been wondering about students who give an address outside the district or the state. In the release, the health district said those cases will be transferred to the district and eventually added to the data portal. \u201cThe dates in which UVa reports cases and when TJHD reports cases will not align perfectly and may have a few days difference due to when tracking cases and tests are conducted,\u201d officials said in the release. Goodman said the health district has seen an increase in cases among students, but so far, the spread of the virus is between students, not between students and the broader community. On Thursday, the health district reported 84 new cases, bringing the total to 3,027. The seven-day average of new cases based on the date of onset, a metric unveiled Monday, continues to decline, though, and stood at 15.43. The percent of positive cases, another closely watched metric, is at 4.8% after declining all month. The agreement covers UVa faculty, staff and students. Those at UVa\u2019s College at Wise and faculty and staff in the Health System are not included. Nor are students in the medical and nursing schools who are exposed at work. Exposure for the latter two groups would be managed by the Health System\u2019s infection prevention and control office. For case investigations, UVa commits to providing TJHD with points of contact in the Office of the Dean of Students to field questions about contact tracing, such as class rosters, employee lists or other information to speed up the process, according to the MOU. Those resources are available from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. seven days a week. Per the MOU, TJHD agrees to contact UVa community members within 24 hours of positive diagnosis and tracing contacts within 48 hours for at least 90% of the time, which is the standard that the health district uses for contacting all community members. The MOU promotes collaboration with UVa and TJHD in creating handbooks, recommendations and guidelines for processes and protocols on isolation and quarantine, assessment, and the evaluation of COVID prevalence within the university community, including a weekly meeting to review the case numbers, according to the release. For general questions about COVID-19, community members can call the TJHD COVID-19 Hotline at (434) 972-6261.","217":"Both universities deny PETA\u2019s claim. PETA claims in its letter to state auditor Martha Mavredes that the universities used part of their $441 million in state funds on animal experiments that were postponed or canceled. It claims that UVa told its researchers to label the cages of the animals that were \u201ccritical to maintain,\u201d and that animals that could be replaced would be euthanized. PETA said Virginia Tech directed its researchers to make contingency plans that \u201cinclude provisions for terminating studies and euthanizing animals.\u201d From these plans, PETA surmises that \u201cthis apparently led to the euthanasia of animals in the school\u2019s laboratories.\u201d If the animals were expendable, PETA wants to know why state funds were \u201cwasted\u201d on nonessential experiments. Mavredes said she forwarded PETA\u2019s letter to the state inspector general\u2019s fraud, waste and abuse hotline. The inspector general\u2019s office has yet to comment on what, if anything, it would do with the request. PETA media manager Tasgola Bruner said an investigator with Virginia\u2019s inspector general office has opened two formal investigations and provided a copy of the email PETA received from the agency. \u201cVirginia Tech did not mandate any animal research to be stopped or delayed due to COVID-19. We did not mandate any animals to be euthanized due to COVID-19,\u201d Mark Owczarski, assistant vice president of university relations at Tech, said in an email. \u201cAt the onset of the pandemic, we did not differentiate animal studies as critical or non-critical. We continued our normal operations providing high quality animal husbandry and veterinary care, consistent with applicable regulations and standards, and classified animal care employees as essential personnel,\u201d he said. Wes Hester, director of media relations for UVa, had a similar response. \u201cThe letter from PETA references a contingency plan developed at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic to be executed in the event of worst-case staffing shortages. Those staffing shortages did not come to pass and the contingency plans were not implemented,\u201d he said. Further, \u201cthere is also no truth to the suggestion that any planned research activities were \u2018unnecessary, nonessential, noncritical, or extraneous,\u2019\u201d Hester said. \u201cIt\u2019s also worth pointing out that most research activities are externally funded and not supported by state appropriations.\u201d UVa and Tech engage in medical research and use animals, predominantly mice, to model human conditions and diseases. These types of experiments, which PETA campaigns to stop, are used to develop vaccines and treatments for diseases that include those caused by coronaviruses.","218":"Albemarle County\u2019s COVID-19 restrictions will now be in place until Nov. 18. On Wednesday night, the Albemarle County Board of Supervisors adopted a new, non-emergency ordinance \u2014 nearly the same as one it passed in July \u2014 that still makes masks mandatory in public, limits restaurants to 50% occupancy indoors and restricts certain public and private in-person gatherings to a maximum of 50 people. The emergency ordinance adopted in July was set to expire Sept. 29 \u201cWe\u2019ve been monitoring the positivity rates and the other data, and it\u2019s quite possible we could come to the board well before Nov. 18,\u201d County Attorney Greg Kamptner said. \u201c... We\u2019ll monitor the circumstances and situation between now and then but we would definitely bring it back for review on the board\u2019s regular meeting date on Nov. 18.\u201d Earlier in the meeting, Ryan McKay, senior policy analyst for the Thomas Jefferson Health District, showed the board local COVID-19 date, including percent positivity over a seven-day average from Aug. 31, Sept. 7 and Sept. 14. \u201cThe trend for Albemarle County since Aug. 31 has been a downward trend, both from positivity but also in number of cases,\u201d he said. The rolling seven-day average for percent positivity was 5.3% as of Sept.14, McKay said. On Sept. 7, it was 6.2% and on Aug. 31, it was 6.3%. Dr. Denise Bonds, director of the health district, when asked about the county\u2019s ordinance, said she thinks it has been helpful. \u201cHaving [University of Virginia] students obviously has added an increasing burden, and we did see an uptick, and I don\u2019t think we\u2019re done seeing the increase in cases because of the increase in numbers of UVa students,\u201d she said. Bonds said she thought the area was entering a \u201creally risky\u201d period with the colder weather. \u201cPeople are going to move from those outdoor activities that were protected, because ... your aerosols were widely spread, to indoor activities where there\u2019s a much greater risk of infection,\u201d she said. \u201cHaving the ordinances that you\u2019ve put in place, I think it\u2019s been really helpful in keeping large gatherings down in keeping the numbers down.\u201d Supervisor Bea LaPisto-Kirtley said she is worried about local restaurants. \u201cI know a lot of them have outdoor dining, but I\u2019m really concerned about independent restaurants, will they survive with outdoor dining and limited indoor, seating,\u201d she said. Deputy County Executive Doug Walker said the county is working on a program to help restaurants that have outdoor seating to be able to extend their season into the colder months. \u201c... With some improvements that will kind of help them continue to provide services outside in accordance with the current limitations on the inside capacity,\u201d he said. Supervisor Liz Palmer said she did recognize that there are some places going out of business. \u201cWe don\u2019t know that they would do any better if we didn\u2019t have this ordinance, because I think that an awful lot of people would be ... staying home more and we\u2019re not going out as much and we\u2019re wearing our masks, etc.,\u201d she said. \u201cSo there\u2019s some self-policing, too.\u201d An owner of a restaurant, winery, brewery or distillery that does not comply with the county\u2019s indoor occupancy cap at 50% of the lowest occupancy load could be charged with a Class 3 misdemeanor, which could carry a $500 fine. Those who do not comply with the mask mandate or those who attend or hold public and private in-person gatherings of more than 50 people could be charged with a Class 1 misdemeanor, which could carry up to one year in jail and a $2,500 fine. On Thursday, county spokeswoman Emily Kilroy said that no one has been charged at this point. \u201cThe intent of the ordinance has been and continues to be education engagement and not enforcement, and that remains true,\u201d she said. \u201cI think the enforcement posture that you\u2019ve seen by there not being any charges is sort of the implementation of that strategy.\u201d The board also approved another update to its ordinance to ensure continuity of government, which will go into effect Oct. 1. Some of the deadlines in the ordinance were updated, including requests for records under the Virginia Freedom of Information Act. Originally, the ordinance said that any deadline for responses to a request for records under the state\u2019s FOIA requirements are \u201cextended indefinitely as may be necessary.\u201d That has been changed to \u201cmay be extended to the earliest date thereafter practicable.\u201d Online news outlet Charlottesville Tomorrow wrote about the indefinite extension, involved the University of Virginia First Amendment Clinic and eventually received the documents it requested from the county school division. The Daily Progress has experienced delays in multiple FOIA responses regarding information about the county government, including one for supervisors\u2019 emails that took more than 20 business days to receive. Kamptner said there were \u201csome media reports\u201d that if someone \u201cfocused on the headlines\u201d they could think that the county was \u201cusing the continuity of governance ordinance as a way to not respond to FOIA requests.\u201d \u201cAs it turns out, we\u2019ve been able to meet the FOIA deadlines quite well,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are some circumstances that may be problematic, but most of the records requests are electronic and as long as custodians of records are present and healthy, that really does not present a problem.\u201d Kamptner said there still could be situations \u201cwhere it may be difficult, if not impossible, for the county to timely respond to FOIA requests,\u201d like when it might be \u201cdangerous or impracticable for the county to timely respond.\u201d \u201cThe reality is that even in normal times, when there are certain lawyer requests that are voluminous, they just work out an agreement with the requester and agree on a date and then just address it and respond according to that agreement,\u201d he said. The ordinance also adds that \u201can audio recording, video recording, or verbatim transcript of any electronic meeting must be made and retained as provided by law,\u201d and that the recordings must be posted on the county\u2019s website, a requirement that had been added to the governor\u2019s budget earlier this year. Many meeting recordings and transcripts are not yet available online. Kilroy said they have the recordings, but they are having issues getting them online. \u201cWe are presently having an issue with the new website\u2019s file size limits,\u201d she said. \u201cThey don\u2019t accommodate a very long video meeting, and we are currently working through how we can manage them.\u201d She said they are looking at using video site YouTube and sharing the links to the videos on the website.","219":"The $3.76 billion budget was approved Sept. 11 by the Board of Visitors. That includes operating budgets of the university\u2019s academic division, Medical Center and the University of Virginia at Wise. The budget includes a nearly 5% cut in services such as travel and cuts in fund transfers between departments, including internal debt service. The pandemic, and the need for social distancing and limited indoor occupancy, forced early closure of the university in the spring and cancellation of many traditional graduation services, as well as furloughs and layoffs for some employees. It also led to a temporary delay in the budget approval process. UVa\u2019s board normally approves the budget in June for the fiscal year that begins July 1, but this year, administrators delayed adoption of a final budget to better predict the pandemic\u2019s impacts. \u201cIt\u2019s really unprecedented. The pandemic has affected many parts of people\u2019s lives, and UVa is no exception,\u201d J.J. Davis, executive vice president and COO for the university, said in an interview this week. \u201cStudents have had different needs, from safety to loss of summer jobs, and we\u2019ve seen more expenses in health and safety and loss of some income, so we wanted to delay the budget to get a better perspective.\u201d The pandemic impacts in the spring and summer struck nearly every UVa department, as well as administration and support services. According to UVa finance information, the university anticipates net tuition and fee income to be reduced by nearly 4% in the 2020-21 budget. State appropriations for the school are expected to drop as much as 14.2%, externally sponsored research income is expected to decrease 1.4% and all revenue sources are predicted to decline 1.7%, the figures show. UVa Medical Center this spring shut down all non-emergency operations and medical procedures to focus on possible floods of COVID-19 patients. That forced the furlough of hundreds of employees and an operating income loss of 48.1%, figures presented to the board show. The UVa board approved a revised $1.83 billion operating budget for the Health System, a 1.3% decrease. The university previously announced a number of major cost-saving moves, including instituting a hiring freeze and foregoing potential merit increases for this fiscal year. Many UVa leaders, including President Jim Ryan, took 10% pay cuts. Every school and operating unit has identified budget cuts for the year. \u201cIt\u2019s impacted a lot of our people. There is a hiring freeze, no pay raises and we\u2019re asking faculty to teach with different modalities at the same time,\u201d Davis said. \u201cOur facilities people are not just concerned with maintenance and repair but are looking for ways to sanitize and clean the facilities to help fight the pandemic. Our staff and faculty are really going above and beyond and their efforts are making this work.\u201d UVa officials said they anticipate financial losses in auxiliary services such as housing, dining and in athletics. Reserve funds will help cover some shortfalls. Like other universities across the country, UVa cautiously approached the fall semester after shifting to all-online learning for the remainder of the spring semester. Undergraduate students returned to residence halls earlier this month to safety measures that include facial coverings, social distancing and no more than 15 students gathering in one place at a time. All students living on Grounds or in the area were required to submit a negative COVID-19 test before being cleared for the semester. The school started classes online for two weeks before allowing in-person instruction last week. Although enrollment numbers did not decline significantly, the number of students living in dorms decreased by 34%. Nearly every COVID-19-related decision had a financial impact, officials said. \u201cAs an example, our decision to delay the start of in-person classes also decreased the number of students living in dorms for those two weeks and that affected income because those students didn\u2019t pay rent or lease costs for that time,\u201d Davis said. \u201cThat also affected dining because the students who live in the dorms are the ones who utilize the dining halls the most.\u201d The pandemic is having a financial impact on the athletic department, as well. No spectators are allowed at the university\u2019s sports contests. That impacts the school\u2019s budget, as well as the bottom line of local restaurants, hotels and other businesses. \u201cNormally, we\u2019re packed to the gills on a weekend for sporting events, and those are not transpiring because of the pandemic,\u201d Davis said. \u201cDepending on how long the pandemic restrictions remain in place, it could have a serious impact.\u201d UVa officials predict the school will see $55 million in one-time costs and lost revenues in the new fiscal year directly associated to the pandemic, should the fall semester go as planned with online and in-person classes. That figure includes an estimated $38 million for COVID preparedness, testing and containment; instructional costs; COVID-related support for students, faculty and staff; personal protective equipment; Plexiglas, tents, sanitizer stands and disinfectant; and the Hoos Health Check app for cellphones and call center staffing. An estimated $14 million in lost revenue is expected in housing and dining due to lower occupancy. The university also will lose $3 million in January term and summer session tuition. Those classes will be offered free to students to help increase academic options. UVa is offering all undergraduates a January term and summer session course at no charge. University officials also are preparing to spend about $10 million more in need-based financial aid than anticipated to help students and their families address a pandemic-ravaged economy. The university received $5.8 million in federal CARES Act funding for financial aid and raised $2.5 million for Bridge Scholarships. Officials have committed to meeting 100% of demonstrated financial need for undergraduate students. The impacts are likely to reverberate through the community at large. Studies from four years ago showed that UVa contributed about $5.9 billion to the regional economy, including spending on goods and services with vendors; spending by employees, students and visitors; and economic impact generated by businesses that benefit from the school. UVa employs about 17,000 in its academic departments on Central Grounds with another 12,000 staffers in the Health System. \u201cHealth and safety is our No. 1 priority, but we wanted to reopen because we thought it was the best for our students\u2019 academic performance,\u201d Davis said. \u201cWe\u2019re in the middle of a pandemic and there is no manual on the shelf for how to deal with that. We are prepared if we need to change.\u201d","220":"Fifteen University of Virginia students who live at Balz-Dobie House have tested positive for COVID-19, the university announced Friday. Students and resident advisers in Echols, Lefevre and Kellogg Houses were told Friday that they must undergo asymptomatic prevalence testing after three students in Kellogg and four in Echols tested positive for the virus, and wastewater monitoring showed indicators of the virus in those residences, according to tweets by the university. Balz-Dobie is the first cluster of cases at UVa since students moved into on-Grounds housing earlier this month. After UVa identified five cases, officials tested every resident and the results showed another 10 cases at the residence hall. UVa spokesman Brian Coy said Friday that residents of Lefevre House were notified Thursday night that they are up next for testing. \u201cThere are no known positive tests at this time, however our wastewater monitoring indicated that there may be signs of early infection, which is why we\u2019re acting now,\u201d he said of Lefevre. As part of the mandatory testing program, students in Echols, Lefevre and Kellogg were told to go to the Student Activity Building on Friday to take a COVID test. Since Aug. 17, 440 students have tested positive for the virus, according to UVa\u2019s COVID-19 tracker, which was expanded Friday afternoon to include more data. The university averaged 25 new cases among students per day this week, according to the tracker. On Friday, the university had 259 active cases among students and staff and a total of 490 cases among faculty, staff and students the tracker started. The expanded tracker will have data about UVa testing, including the number of daily tests performed as well as positive tests among students and UVa employees. Data from the past week will be available to show trends. Other information such as the daily average of new cases and active cases will be available. Dr. Mitch Rosner, the chair of the Department of Medicine who is involved in planning UVa\u2019s COVID-19 response, explained the changes to the COVID-19 tracker during a weekly video update from the university released Thursday. Rosner said an active case means that it was detected in the last 10 days and required isolation either on- or off-Grounds. Rosner said the changes were in \u201cresponse to our evolving knowledge and continued feedback.\u201d All UVa-affiliated cases are also included in the Thomas Jefferson Health District\u2019s COVID-19 data portal. The health district is investigating the positive cases at Balz-Dobie and contacting all close contacts, so others still might need to quarantine as well. Students who tested positive have been notified, according to a UVa news release, and are being placed in isolation housing. Those who have had close contacts with those affected will be quarantined. Students will be notified when it\u2019s safe to leave the space, effectively ending their isolation or quarantine period, according to UVa\u2019s response plan. Once UVa identified the cluster through wastewater and individual testing programs, students were asked to stay inside their rooms until the testing could be completed. About 188 students live at Balz-Dobie. UVa is testing the wastewater of residence halls and other buildings to detect any potential outbreaks along with other mandatory testing among students regardless of if they are showing symptoms. \u201cWe thank the residents of Balz-Dobie for their patience and cooperation and ask all UVa community members to continue wearing masks, stay home when they feel sick, follow physical distancing guidelines, and avoid large gatherings,\u201d school officials said in a news release.","221":"This story has been updated The University of Virginia has identified 14 coronavirus cases in two more residence halls. Five cases have been confirmed in the Echols residence hall and nine have been found in Kellogg, UVa announced Saturday. Echols is home to 117 students and Kellogg houses 161. Officials first found four cases in each residence hall through wastewater and individual testing. Follow-up asymptomatic prevalence testing confirmed the remaining cases. Students who tested positive are being placed in isolation housing while their close contacts are being placed in quarantine housing. UVa on Saturday initially announced six cases in Echols and 11 in Kellogg. Later Saturday, UVa spokesman Brian Coy said that officials determined that three of those students had tested positive before returning to Grounds. Under UVa and federal guidelines, they quarantined for two weeks and then came to Grounds. Once officials conducted residence-wide testing, those students received positive results again. However, under guidance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, they are no longer considered contagious and are therefore not included in the active case count. Students in Echols, Kellogg and Lefevre were told Friday to undergo testing after cases were identified. The test results from Lefevre are still pending. As of Friday, 15 students had tested positive at Balz-Dobie in the first cluster of cases since students returned earlier this month. UVa has reported 490 coronavirus cases from Aug. 17 to Friday, including 440 students. The university averaged 25 new cases among students per day last week, according to UVa\u2019s data tracker. The tracker is not updated on the weekends. UVa started the year with 1,500 quarantine rooms, although the number fluctuates. As of Friday, 19% of quarantine housing had been filled.","222":"As local activists face fines for organizing unpermitted events, some Charlottesville officials and city councilors are at odds over the city\u2019s approach to a planned Aug. 12 demonstration and its slow move to issue the fines. The city has started cracking down on events that don\u2019t receive a permit in light of the coronavirus pandemic. Robert Gray received a $500 fine for the Juneteenth celebration in Washington Park. Zyahna Bryant was fined $500 on Sept. 4 for organizing the Black Joy Fest without a permit, according to a letter obtained under the Virginia Freedom of Information Act. She did not return a request for comment. As of Friday, the city is still reviewing the use of Market Street Park for the Reclaim the Park event on Aug. 12, even though it occurred four days after Bryant\u2019s Black Joy Fest and it\u2019s been two weeks since she was fined. The city stopped issuing special event permits on March 12 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. All fines have been issued for violating the event regulations rather than an ordinance limiting in-person gatherings to slow the spread of the coronavirus. The city\u2019s operating procedures for special events make exceptions for events of fewer than 50 people and demonstrations that occur without prior planning or announcement as a spontaneous response to a newsworthy occurrence. Council concern Outgoing City Manager Tarron Richardson, whose last day is Sept. 30, issued a warning ahead of the Aug. 12 event to community organizers saying they could be cited for it. His statement focused on the city\u2019s ordinance intended to slow the spread of the coronavirus and highlighted dangers of non-permitted events. According to emails obtained through FOIA, Richardson\u2019s statement was supported by leadership in the police and fire departments, but received pushback from Councilors Michael Payne and Sena Magill for holding a hard line around a delicate subject. While Magill and Payne wrote that they understood the strain that the events placed on city resources, they felt the planned tone of Richardson\u2019s statement could spark turmoil around the anniversary of the deadly 2017 Unite the Right rally. \u201cThe way this particular release has been worded will potentially light a match,\u201d Magill wrote. \u201cThe trauma that people are still experiencing is very real, the need for the community to express that is just as important as the precautions we need to take regarding covid.\u201d According to the emails, the statement was revised before it was published. In further exchanges, some councilors were concerned about the city\u2019s slow response to the events. They were worried that an extended review process could undermine the need to exercise equal enforcement of its regulations. In late August, Richardson issued a stronger statement saying that the city has supported the community\u2019s right to \u201cpeaceably assemble,\u201d but that \u201cobstructing city streets and using parks without the proper permits will no longer be allowed.\u201d The statement said that organizers of previous events would be fined, but at the time not all had received a penalty. The statement appeared to reignite simmering tensions between Richardson and the council and came two weeks before the two parties announced they had mutually agreed to part ways. In an email to Richardson the night after the statement was released, Mayor Nikuyah Walker asked if only the Juneteenth organizer had been fined and, if so, \u201cthat isn\u2019t fair and should be corrected.\u201d Walker, who indicated she had asked the questions in a text message as well and hadn\u2019t received an answer, asked if Richardson had decided only to fine Gray and what led to his decision. In response, Richardson first detailed a paragraph about his whereabouts since Walker\u2019s text and why he hadn\u2019t yet responded. He said that he was reviewing the events and the Juneteenth event was already fined because Gray had agreed to pay it rather than cancel the event. Walker responded that Richardson\u2019s first paragraph was \u201cunnecessary and rude per usual.\u201d She said the events don\u2019t need an extended review process. \u201cThese events did not need further review. You\u2019ve been present for all of them, you know which ordinance was in effect, and you know the amount that each event costs the City,\u201d she wrote. \u201cIf you\u2019re not fining everyone who has had an event, you shouldn\u2019t fine anyone. It\u2019s simple.\u201d Councilor Heather Hill responded that it was her understanding organizers would be fined for all events that were not spontaneous demonstrations, which Richardson confirmed. \u201cI do agree that it should not be a lengthy process to evaluate this and it is important for the community to understand sooner versus later that we are being consistent,\u201d she wrote. Councilors have noted the city is trying to strike a difficult balance between public safety and free speech. Magill said Saturday the regulations are especially difficult with the convergence of the pandemic and ongoing unrest around police brutality and systemic racism. \u201cWe are trying to navigate two pandemics. Many of the protests are bringing forward that there\u2019s been this other pandemic going on for hundreds of years and it has to stop and they\u2019ve been saying it has to stop and it\u2019s not stopping. And we have to stop it,\u201d she said. \u201cThese protests are just as important because so many people think we\u2019re done with it. There are still so many people who don\u2019t think they\u2019re racist when they have racial bias and they don\u2019t realize they do and don\u2019t want to believe they do.\u201d Hill said Friday enforcing the ordinance is \u201cvery challenging because we do care about this community.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a very delicate balance of wanting to be sure we allow people to express themselves while keeping our community safe,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s really important we\u2019re consistent with enforcing our ordinances.\u201d Staff\u2019s concerns Meanwhile, Police Chief RaShall Brackney has pushed for stronger enforcement measures while Neighborhood Development Services Director Alex Ikefuna said downtown business owners could call the police with concerns about an activist group delivering aid. Jason Ness, the city\u2019s business development manager, wrote in an Aug. 18 email that he had been approached by Downtown Mall business owners with concerns about a tent that had been routinely set up on the mall. The tent, operated by the Charlottesville Black Youth Action Committee, was used as the focal point to distribute food and water for people who are homeless. The committee also accepted monetary donations for community organizations, but didn\u2019t overtly use the tent for a fundraiser. Ness wrote that the organizers were using a tent and amplified sound without a permit. He said one business owner called the police over a dispute with those at the table \u201cso there are larger issues at play.\u201d Ness said downtown business owners supported the committee\u2019s cause, but were concerned that if they were allowed to operate without a permit that a group with \u201coffensive ideas\u201d could receive the same leeway. \u201cI\u2019m not sure what are the exact next steps but if this group continues to plan to set up on the Mall, then it is in the City\u2019s best interest to ensure all vendors are treated the same and held to the same expectations,\u201d Ness wrote. Assistant Zoning Administrator Craig Fabio told Ness the tent didn\u2019t require a vending permit and he felt it should fall under special event regulations. He said it could be considered a demonstration, but if it was that the group should not use the tent for safety reasons. Ikefuna wrote to Ness that the police department is responsible for enforcing the noise ordinance and, therefore, business owners should contact officers if there is a noise concern. \u201cIt is more effective to call the police when the violation is occurring rather than after the fact,\u201d he wrote. Brackney wrote to city leadership about a planned event on Aug. 21 with contact information for the organizers, one of whom she said was a University of Virginia student. Brackney came under fire this summer after Virginia State Police troopers were seen using city vehicles to respond to a nonviolent rally protesting police brutality. In response to Brackney\u2019s email, Interim Fire Chief Emily Pelliccia noted UVa has a portal for community members to report violations of its coronavirus regulations, whether on Grounds or not. Brackney was concerned about events calling for attendees not to notify or speak with police or the media, saying they were \u201ccause for a heightened level of concern.\u201d \u201cWe need to do something about these events and the strain they are putting on City resources,\u201d she wrote. She also notified city leaders about a planned event by activist Tanesha Hudson later this month, writing \u201cAnother park event \u2026 this is getting out of control.\u201d Councilor Lloyd Snook said the city has \u201ca legitimate interest in controlling demonstrations that disrupt traffic, or that monopolize a city park.\u201d \u201cIf someone wants to stage a demonstration that blocks important intersections at rush hour, the city is allowed to say, \u2018Not then, not there. Two hours earlier or later, or in the Park; just not then and there,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThat power to regulate the \u2018when\u2019 and \u2018where\u2019 of demonstrations is not unlimited, but nor is the freedom of protesters to choose the \u2018when\u2019 and \u2018where.\u2019\u201d Snook said if the city allows protests to violate the coronavirus regulations on crowd sizes, it would hypothetically have less legal standing at a fraternity party. Above all, Magill noted, the city is focused on the coronavirus pandemic. While most protesters or demonstrators may follow safety measures, Magill said, the city doesn\u2019t have the resources nor does it want to go through a crowd and ensure that every single person is being safe. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to be some sort of dictatorship that\u2019s going through and checking people\u2019s papers,\u201d she said. \u201cWe want the police as far away from free speech protesting as possible.\u201d","223":"It wasn\u2019t a new battle for the Army Reserve officer. It was just more of the same war he\u2019d been waging as a nurse in the University of Virginia Medical Center\u2019s COVID care units. \u201c... When COVID started hitting hard in this country, everybody in the Army Reserve medical units thought we\u2019d be involved at some point,\u201d Wiseman recalled from his current post at Valley Baptist Hospital in Harlingen, Texas. \u201cI assumed it would be coming at some point or another. I had a lot of friends who went before me,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI think [the Army was] trying not to rob staff from other hospitals all at once, but the need is out there.\u201d Wiseman is a member of Urban Augmentation Military Task Force 7458. Known as UAMTFs, the units are deployed by the Army Reserve Medical Command, Southeast Medical Area Readiness Support Group, to help hospitals whose medical staffs are slammed by COVID-19 cases. The 85-person outfits augment the civilian medical community with a range of critical medical capabilities. Each task force includes doctors, nurses, combat medics, respiratory specialists and other personnel. Wiseman\u2019s unit is one of six sent to south Texas to help meet the need for more personnel. \u201cNeed is an understatement,\u201d said Angelica Anaya, director of the COVID care units at Valley Baptist Hospital. \u201cOur staff is working hard and they desperately needed help. We were looking to our left and our right to determine how we were going to safely staff our facility.\u201d When the pandemic first reached the United States, Texas cracked down as hard as Virginia. Restaurants and bars were closed and unnecessary travel was discouraged. For a while, things were under control, Anaya said. \u201cIn March, we got the first cases and the hospital set up specialty units to handle the patients,\u201d she said. \u201cAs the virus progressed, we noticed peaks and valleys in the number of patients we had, but we had a good grasp of things. We were busy, but we weren\u2019t overwhelmed.\u201d In April, the staff got a break as the number of COVID cases dropped. \u201cWe had time to look at what we were doing and find better ways to do it,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen the cases were negligible, we were able to cover that.\u201d In June, the state loosened its restrictions and the virus took off, especially among guests from nearby Padre Island. \u201cPeople had more respect for it at first because it was new. The nursing home cases were the first reported and then it spread to caregivers,\u201d Anaya recalled. \u201cComing into April, we thought we had a grasp on it. Then the state relaxed the restrictions. We saw people relaxing the rules and then we saw the immediate impact.\u201d The sick, she said, came in hordes. \u201cWe were starting to get additional cases coming in and patients who came in for other reasons were testing positive and became COVID patients, as well. We started seeing whole families come in and we began converting other units of the hospital to COVID units,\u201d Anaya said. Traveling nurses helped the hospital crews tend to the patients, but the virus kept spreading and more and more people were getting sick and sicker. Some were in the intensive care units for weeks and the COVID units for a month. \u201cAt some point, the volume was so high that even with 180 nurses, it just wasn\u2019t enough,\u201d Anaya said. \u201cWe got to the point where we had more COVID units than non-COVID units in the hospital and our staff was wearing out.\u201d Enter the U.S. Department of Defense and the UAMTFs. The first UAMTFs to arrive began treating patients in July. \u201cThat was a relief. We knew that with the military coming in, they would bring a certain skill and culture with them that would help us out,\u201d Anaya said. For Wiseman, the disease, its progression, its impacts and its deadly nature were known through his experience working at UVa. \u201cI was in the provider role [at UVa] and that made it easier for sure. I knew what COVID could do and what treatments were available and was familiar with the technology. It wasn\u2019t strange to me,\u201d he recalled. What he wasn\u2019t expecting was more than 350 patients needing intense care all at once. \u201cNot only were volumes picking up, but patients in this area have co-morbidities such as diabetes and kidney issues, problems they live with until they are exposed to the virus,\u201d he said. \u201cWith those other medical issues, as COVID progresses, patients get sicker and sicker.\u201d Wiseman said it didn\u2019t take long to realize he wasn\u2019t in Charlottesville anymore. \u201cThere\u2019s no comparison. It\u2019s the same disease process, for sure, but as far as numbers, the challenges [at UVa] weren\u2019t that high,\u201d he said. \u201cWith so many patients, it\u2019s not easy to practice what we consider good medicine, giving each patient individual attention and providing that high level of personal care. That\u2019s because it\u2019s a constant game of figuring out what the problems are, how many patients you have, who needs what type of care and trying to work around it.\u201d For the hospital staff, the military teams were godsends. \u201cMy role is to do what I can to help those frontline nurses and doctors who are going in there every day and the people who are patients who are sometimes in there for two months with no visitation and no contact with their family,\u201d Anaya said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard on them and it\u2019s hard on our staff because some of them are very sick and they\u2019ve lost loved ones to the very same disease. They know how serious it is. Others don\u2019t know that there is a loved one in the hospital with them or that they may never see them again,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is a community where we were treating literally whole families who were admitted and who had already lost a parent or a brother or a sister,\u201d Wiseman said. \u201cYou\u2019re taking care of a patient knowing they had already lost a family member and are concerned about getting out themselves. You really feel for that patient and know this has been a big impact on their lives.\u201d \u201cWhen this first started, it was terror for some of our people to walk into that room, knowing they won\u2019t come out for a while and what\u2019s going on in there,\u201d Anaya said. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to walk through those doors and come out 14 hours later.\u201d Both Anaya and Wiseman say taking precautions against the virus, such as wearing masks and keeping distance, helps them out by decreasing the number of patients. \u201cBecause it\u2019s not tangible, people seem to not take it seriously or they get complacent,\u201d Anaya said. \u201cWe thought we had this beat. It went away for a little bit and we let our guard down and it came back. It\u2019s out there. These are the consequences.\u201d \u201cPeople need to continue to do what they\u2019re being asked to do. Wear masks, keep a distance between them,\u201d Wiseman said. \u201cThis is not something you want to get, and that cannot be said enough. Simply because you haven\u2019t had it doesn\u2019t mean is it\u2019s not still happening. If you have the ability to make it not happen, you should.\u201d For Wiseman, his family back in Crozet helps him through the crazy days. \u201cI have the two coolest kids and the most amazing wife in the world. Thankfully, we have tools that help keep me connected with family and friends,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel good about the fact that I was able to step up and help. This community has done some pretty amazing things to get through what they need to do.\u201d","224":"RICHMOND \u2014 Life on college campuses as it currently exists, with online classes, COVID-19 tests randomly administered to students and distancing measures taken in dorms and academic buildings, is likely to extend into the 2021 spring semester. Multiple college presidents have said that the next semester is likely to resemble the current one. \u201cWe\u2019re in this for the long haul,\u201d Virginia Tech President Timothy Sands said at a recent virtual town hall. \u201cThis is an at-least-a-year [ordeal].\u201d Most colleges in the commonwealth have reopened their campuses to offer a blended curriculum of online and in-person classes. But schools have taken criticism for putting students at risk, and James Madison University was forced to retreat and close campus after nearly 800 positive cases surfaced among students and faculty. In defending their decision to reopen, college presidents have said their plans were made with long-term implications in mind. If he knew with certainty that the virus would be eradicated by November, Virginia Tech would have taken a different approach to the fall semester, Sands said. Instead, the school reopened knowing life would look different for many months but at least some in-person aspects of college life would be maintained. Finances also played a major role. Colleges in Virginia stood to lose anywhere between $250 million and $800 million had they stayed closed, said Aubrey Layne, the state secretary of finance. Michael Rao, Virginia Commonwealth University\u2019s president, said he expects many of the safety measures the school has adopted for the fall term to continue into the spring. Some of them might be expanded. VCU officials are randomly testing members of the community, performing contact tracing for positive cases and operating dorms at below capacity. \u201cThere\u2019s still a lot we can learn as we continue to go through this semester,\u201d Rao said. Presidents at Arizona State University and Rice University in Texas also said they expect the spring semester to resemble the current one. There are simply too many unknowns, Sands said, to assume a quick return to normal life. The arrival of a vaccine is estimated in late 2020 or early 2021 at best. It\u2019s unclear how quickly college students would receive it. Because there likely would be limited supply of the vaccine, it would be distributed to different populations based on risk factors and need. Relatively healthy college students figure to be a low-priority group. It\u2019s also unclear if the vaccine will be effective and whether enough people will be willing to take it. According to a poll conducted by VCU, 4 in 10 Virginia residents say they are not likely to receive a COVID-19 vaccine, even if it is approved by the Food and Drug Administration and offered at no cost. Sands said there\u2019s been talk at Virginia Tech of students wanting to become infected with COVID-19, to get isolation over with, and then to recover. He called that a \u201crisky and incorrect assumption.\u201d Lasting effects, such as the loss of smell and taste and a persisting heart condition, have been linked to young, otherwise healthy patients. \u201cIt\u2019s not likely to be that simple,\u201d said Michael Friedlander, Virginia Tech\u2019s vice president for health sciences. Virginia Tech has the second-highest case count in the state, but the Blacksburg university might not follow the same path as JMU, which, after closing in early September recently announced it would welcome back students and renew in-person classes Oct. 5. Going remote, Sands said, won\u2019t help that much. If students remain in Blacksburg in off-campus apartments, the virus can still be transmitted among them. If a cluster of positive cases is contained in a single dorm, and the students of that dorm are sent home, the virus is then dispersed to far-flung communities. A major factor that determines if a university campus can stay open is the capacity of its isolation space. When a college can no longer house all of its sick students, it might be forced to close. Virginia Tech has filled 73% of its isolation beds, a spokesman said last week. At the University of Virginia, in-person classes began Sept. 8. Since then, the school has reported 311 new cases, with about 90% of those cases being among students. A spokesman did not respond to a question about the college\u2019s expectations for the spring 2021 semester. If Virginia colleges can continue to house students who tested positive in isolation, they can continue keeping campus open and operating a modified curriculum for the long term. Of course, if trends reverse and cases diminish, Sands said, Virginia Tech can continue to resume a more normal life. There\u2019s just little indication that a quick resolution is coming.","225":"University of Virginia President Jim Ryan on Tuesday announced three new COVID-19 restrictions that will begin Wednesday, which inlcude limiting travel and reducing gatherings to no more than five people. In a video, Ryan addressed students and reassured them that the new restrictions are mostly preemptive. Students have, for the most part, been doing the right thing, Ryan said, though the university has received some reports of large gatherings. \u201cAs we\u2019ve said from the very beginning, staying one step ahead of this virus will not be easy,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will require everyone doing their part \u2013 not just some of the time or even most of the time, but all the time.\u201d Among the new restrictions is a reduction in the number of students allowed to gather, which has been reduced from 15 to five. If the new gathering number is not respected, Ryan said, additional measures may be taken, including imposition of a curfew. All students will continue to be required to wear masks at all times, apart from when they are at home, eating or exercising outdoors, Ryan said. Lastly, the UVa is ramping up its travel and visitor policy, requesting that students not leave Charlottesville for the next two weeks and do not invite outsiders to grounds. UVa athletics has an exception from some of the restrictions announced by the university, per a university spokesperson. The two-week travel ban doesn't apply to road sporting events, so UVa football's game at Clemson is still set for Oct. 3. \u201cThis is to protect people outside this community, as well as to prevent more of the virus from being brought back to grounds,\u201d Ryan said. The new restrictions \u2014 which also apply to faculty and staff \u2014 will officially go into place at 9 a.m. Wednesday, Ryan said and will last at least for the next two weeks. \u201cWe hope and trust you will follow these restrictions, but if need be, we\u2019ll have no choice but to enforce them,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have already had to issue interim suspensions to several students for intentionally disregarding policies around gatherings, masking and social distancing and we will be even more vigilant going forward.\u201d UVa will continue in-person classes during the next two weeks, he said, as the university has no evidence that classes have spread the virus. UVa will continue to ramp up testing \u2013 monitoring the wastewater coming out of dorms, testing random groups of students every day and rolling out saliva screening that will allow UVa to test larger numbers of students at multiple locations. Ryan said he knows the path ahead will be difficult but that he believes the UVa community can handle it. \u201cWhile getting to Thanksgiving is going to be hard, all of you have shown over the last six months that you can do hard things \u2013 whether it\u2019s missing graduations and sports seasons, figuring out online classes or trying to make new friends under extraordinarily challenging circumstances,\u201d he said. Daily Progress reporter Bennett Conlin contributed to this report.","226":"The Albemarle County School Board will decide in two weeks what to do about in-person classes for the second quarter \u2014 a decision that as of now will be made based on a set of factors but no clear metrics. Meanwhile, a resolution proposed by the Albemarle Education Association outlined several suggested metrics, including the percent positivity and case incidence rates, for each reopening stage. The county school system is following a five-stage reopening plan that phases in groups of students for in-person classes. The division started the first quarter in Stage Two. Josh Mound, a teacher at Center I and member of the AEA, said teachers think it\u2019s important to remove politics from reopening decisions and focus on science and safety, hence the resolution. \u201cMovement between stages shouldn\u2019t be a fraught, uncertain issue every quarter,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we focus on clear benchmarks, then families and teachers can know if we\u2019re on track to move stages in the next quarter or not. The benchmarks also let the public, county officials, University of Virginia and other community leaders know what we need to do as a community to fight COVID\u2019s spread and open schools safely.\u201d Schools Superintendent Matt Haas will recommend a stage for the second quarter at the School Board\u2019s next meeting, on Oct. 8, and then the board members will vote. In advance of that decision, the School Board discussed the current COVID-19 case numbers during its meeting Thursday. Thursday\u2019s COVID-19 presentation did include color-coded numbers for the case incidence and positivity rates but neither the Virginia Department of Health nor the school system has explained how those colors are determined. Case incidence rates in Albemarle have fluctuated and the rolling seven-day average has stayed under 10 while Charlottesville\u2019s case numbers continue to climb when looking at the rates per 100,000 residents. In the last month, Charlottesville\u2019s seven-day average case incidence rate has increased from 4.8 to 46.9. Albemarle\u2019s average was 8.5. \u201cWe wanted to explain that the metrics we received from the Virginia Department of Health are intended to provide a starting point for conversations and decision making,\u201d said Eileen Gomez, the division\u2019s COVID-19 coordinator. \u201cWe do not have absolute benchmarks for which people are clamoring.\u201d Ryan McKay, senior policy analyst with the Thomas Jefferson Health District, helped with the presentation and echoed Gomez that the data is a starting for a broader discussion about the what the risk may be. \u201cSo, I think the context behind the data is important,\u201d McKay said. The district\u2019s positivity rate was at 4.7% on Thursday and has remained under 5% for the last eight days, which McKay said reflected the \u201cmassive amounts of testing going on.\u201d State officials repeatedly have said that any decision about school reopenings is a local one, though VDH does provide divisions with information about risk levels based on the case numbers. Not all of that information is publicly available. The School Board could lean on indicators and metrics released last week by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which gauge the risk level in schools. However, those indicators were not discussed during Thursday\u2019s meeting. The School Board also has not discussed what it would like the case numbers and other data points to be before moving to a different reopening stage, despite calls at public comment for the board to do so. For example, if the health department determines there\u2019s a moderate risk of transmission, it\u2019s unclear what that would mean for the schools. With Albemarle\u2019s current COVID-19 ordinance \u2014 which makes masks mandatory in public, limits restaurants to 50% occupancy indoors and restricts certain public and private in-person gatherings to a maximum of 50 people \u2014 officials said they wanted to see a benchmark of a positivity rate of 5% or lower for at least 14 days before lifting restrictions, citing the World Health Organization\u2019s recommendation. The Board of Supervisors on Sept. 16 approved the current restrictions until Nov. 18, but County Attorney Greg Kamptner said county staff would continue to monitor the situation between now and then. Some speakers during Thursday\u2019s public comment section urged the board to adopt benchmarks or metrics to use in determining which stage to move to and supported the resolution from the AEA. \u201cBut it can\u2019t be just like nine weeks and then it\u2019s going to magically disappear; an arbitrary nine weeks in one phase, then go to the next is not acceptable,\u201d said Erin Wise-Ackenbom, a teacher at Albemarle High School. \u201cYou need to use science and data, and look at the experts. \u2026 If you don\u2019t like what AEA has laid out \u2026 then make your own and make it clean.\u201d The AEA\u2019s resolution includes thresholds for Stages Three, Four and Five that are based on the district\u2019s positive rate, the case incidence rates per 100,000 residents for Charlottesville and Albemarle, the testing capacity and turnaround times for test results. For Stage Three, the association wants to see a positivity rate below 3% for the previous 14 days; fewer than five new cases in Albemarle and Charlottesville during the previous 14 days; at least 150 new tests per 100,000 residents per day over the previous 14 days; and providing of COVID-19 testing to students and staff, with results available in less than 48 hours. \u201cThe Albemarle Education Association will actively oppose any change in phases divorced from reasonable data benchmarks and the latest research on COVID-19 safety,\u201d according to the resolution. Several teachers who spoke during the meeting were opposed to moving to Stage Three, which the division is currently weighing. Those who spoke said virtual learning is going well and that it\u2019s not yet safe to return to school, echoing many of the concerns raised in July when the board initially decided how to start the school year. \u201cI want nothing more than to go back to the classroom and be with my students, but I only want that when it is safe for everyone,\u201d said Kathryn DeAtley, a kindergarten teacher at Meriwether Lewis Elementary. In July, 65% of teachers said they didn\u2019t feel comfortable returning to the classroom. Parents were divided on their levels of concern with returning to school, though 67% preferred hybrid learning. About half of the division\u2019s parents responded to the July survey. Bo Odom, a parent of a first-grader at Greer Elementary, said during public comment that virtual learning was not working for his child. \u201cIt\u2019s enrichment, not learning,\u201d he said. \u201c... These are first-graders. We shouldn\u2019t expect the kind of self-control necessary for online learning.\u201d In weighing whether to move to Stage Three, the division has listed several factors, including state and federal guidance, current COVID-19 conditions in the area, ability to staff the schools and the district\u2019s testing capacity. In the past two months, the district has ramped up testing as UVa has offered more community testing locations and started testing students more regularly. This month, the district is averaging 625 tests a day, according to an analysis of VDH data. \u201cWe heard often tonight about safety,\u201d McKay said. \u201cThat\u2019s really hard to define. It\u2019s better to define the potential risks involved there and what are we doing, not just in relation to positivity rates and the case counts, but what are we doing holistically, as a community, to mitigate and minimize risk.\u201d Division spokesman Phil Giaramita said McKay\u2019s comments were useful and that he was not aware of any plans to propose a checklist to the board. \u201cI think the recommendation will take into account a range of factors, including health data, feedback from parents, students and staff via the upcoming online surveys and recommendations from the federal and state public health experts,\u201d he said in an email. School Board member Katrina Callsen asked McKay whether schools are a place where risk would be low and how they could lower that risk. \u201cBecause it\u2019s hard as a board member without a health background to just see the numbers and feel like we need to make the decision based on the numbers,\u201d she said. McKay said the reopenings in Louisa and Greene counties show it can be done safely with a host of mitigation strategies in place, from daily health screenings to keeping students in separate groups, as well as quick responses to positive cases. \u201cWhile school doesn\u2019t look like school in terms of the numbers and what a classroom looks like, they have been very successful at bringing students back, implementing policies such as face masks, putting markers on the floor, stickers on the floor, as well as reminders of how to do physical and social distancing,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, the strategies they put in both levels have been pretty remarkable to see.\u201d As of Thursday, Louisa County was averaging 4.3 new cases per 100,000 residents while Greene County was at 3.6.","227":"More than a dozen students living in the Hancock Residence Hall at the University of Virginia have tested positive for COVID-19 and will be moved into isolation housing, university officials announced Friday afternoon. Officials said 16 students, including six pairs of roommates, tested positive. Close contacts of the students will move to quarantine housing. The Virginia Department of Health has begun contact tracing and additional close contacts will also be moved into quarantine housing. Hancock houses 115 residents. Follow-up testing of the rest of the residents will take place next week. The cases were identified through the wastewater testing program at the university and through prevalence testing of students who do not have symptoms of COVID-19. Hancock residents who tested negative are being asked to follow mask policy, physical distancing, and to follow university guidelines on limited gatherings of no more than five students. They\u2019re also asked to stay in their own dorm rooms until the second round of testing for the residence hall is complete next week. At the same time, UVa will make a follow-up round of tests for residents of Balz-Dobie Residence Hall, which had students test positive for the virus last week. Since in-person, on-Grounds classes began earlier this month, students have received positive COVID tests in Echols, Lefevre and Kellogg resident centers as well as Hancock and Balz-Dobie. As of Friday, the UVa COVID dashboard showed 158 positive test returns since Sept. 18 of which 149 were students and the rest staff, faculty and employees. During the week of Sept. 13 to Sept. 19, the last for which information is available, there were 184 positive COVID tests among 2,007 tests given to students. That\u2019s less than a 10% positive rate for tests given to students. There have been 590 cases of COVID-19 among students on Grounds since Aug. 17 and there are currently 265 active cases of COVID-19 among students, according to the UVa figures. There have been 58 COVID-19 cases among employees, staff and faculty since Aug. 17 of which 10 are currently active.","228":"An inflammation syndrome in some children exposed to COVID-19 may serve as a warning to researchers working on a virus vaccine to keep safety in mind, a University of Virginia researcher and his colleagues say. New findings in the study of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, known as MIS-C, show that children with the condition have elevated levels of antibodies that their bodies created to fight the proteins the COVID-causing virus uses to infect a body. The exact cause of MIS-C and whether the increased antibodies are a cause or an effect of the condition is not known. However, the researchers say it\u2019s important that the findings be considered as labs everywhere race to bring a vaccine to market. \u201cThe great thing about vaccines is, when they work well, they teach the immune system to fight off the pathogen for the future. If you had a measles vaccine as a child and are exposed to measles as an adult, your body knows how to defend itself,\u201d said Dr. Steven Zeichner, of the UVa Children\u2019s Hospital. \u201cBut it\u2019s because of the long-term impacts that there needs to be a higher standard for a vaccine.\u201d Zeichner and Dr. Andrea Cruz, of Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, wrote commentaries for the journal Pediatrics pointing out that MIS-C could be a harbinger of potential dangers of a vaccine or COVID-19 treatment if research is not thorough. Zeichner and Cruz are both editors of the publication. MIS-C can result in inflammation of the heart, lungs, kidneys, brain, skin, eyes, or gastrointestinal organs. It can result in abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, neck pain, rash, bloodshot eyes, exhaustion and, in the most severe cases, death. An estimated 98% of MIS-C cases were in children diagnosed as having COVID-19 and developed between two and four weeks after infection. The other 2% were in children who had been exposed to people with COVID-19, according to research. MIS-C is caused by a massive activation of pro-inflammatory cells called cytokines, referred to as a cytokine storm. Researchers believe similar cytokine storms may cause some of the severe responses to COVID-19 seen in adults. Multiple studies of deaths related to COVID-19 and patients who recovered from the disease indicate that the virus causes inflammatory responses throughout the body. Many studies suggested treating COVID-19 as \u201can acute inflammatory disease\u201d and indicated the more someone\u2019s immune response is compromised, the more serious the disease will be for that person. Zeichner and Cruz\u2019s commentary accompanies an article written by Christina A. Rostad and colleagues from Emory University and the University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston. They discovered that children with MIS-C had high levels of antibodies against the virus\u2019 spike proteins, or receptor binding domain, that hook the virus into host cells in the body. The discovery could prove helpful in diagnosing MIS-C, but should throw up red flags for the binding cell antibody treatments and antibody-based vaccines currently under development. Researchers currently are studying the effectiveness of treating severely ill COVID patients with plasma from people who have recovered from COVID-19. The idea is that the plasma already contains antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes the disease. Many of the 200 or so vaccines being studied also rely on antibodies to the binding domain proteins. \u201cWe don\u2019t know if antibodies against [binding domain cells] are associated with the development of MIS-C or if they could somehow help to cause MIS-C or other inflammatory processes,\u201d Zeichner said. \u201cIf they do contribute to inflammation, it might have an impact on convalescent plasma treatments or a vaccine.\u201d In their commentary, Zeichner and Cruz note that researchers studying treatments or working on vaccines should carefully evaluate those participating in the program while being treated and, in the case of a vaccine, for a period of time afterward. \u201cSafety, especially in a vaccine, is important. A vaccine teaches the body to respond in a certain way and, if there\u2019s a chance that response could make things worse, we need to know,\u201d Zeichner said. \u201cWe do not want to have a situation where patients do not have confidence that a vaccine is safe or that is prematurely approved and later has significant safety concerns.\u201d Zeichner said COVID is a \u201chuge challenge\u201d for society but it\u2019s important not to cut corners while making haste. \u201cWe need to remember the vaccines would be given to healthy people to prevent the disease,\u201d he said. \u201cVaccines work well by teaching the immune system how to fight off a pathogen. But we need to know if that response that the body learns can make the disease worse. The MIS-C finding should be considered a warning to keep safety in mind.\u201d","229":"Ipsos, a French firm that provides information and research gleaned from the internet and social media to corporations, governments and in public polls, is combining efforts with the University of Virginia Center for Politics and Sabato\u2019s Crystal Ball to give political junkies insight into the increasingly fractured U.S. electorate. The team has created Political Atlas to provide not only polling figures but spending trends and hot items and topics on social media and internet searches. The information goes from the national scene down to the state and, in some cases, the county level. The atlas can be found at political-atlas.com and is free. \u201cWe have worked with Ipsos for two elections cycles now, 2018 and 2020,\u201d said Kyle D. Kondik, managing editor of Sabato\u2019s Crystal Ball. \u201cThey have built some really cool and innovative tools that measure social media sentiment, model presidential job approval at the county level, and many other trends.\u201d Kondik said the Crystal Ball\u2019s political analysis adds context to Ipsos\u2019 figures. \u201cWe provide to them our race ratings to add a qualitative element to the quantitative research they produce,\u201d Kondik said \u201cIpsos is a major international pollster, and they are great to work with.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s more important than ever to provide as much context as possible to political polling numbers,\u201d Clifford Young, president of U.S. public affairs at Ipsos, said in a statement. \u201cOn-the-ground analysis of what issues are being discussed on the internet and in the media, what people are seeing on their social media feeds, how many new cases of COVID-19 there are in a given state, how bad unemployment has gotten, these factors all matter a great deal and we ensured they were a major feature in our platform,\u201d Young said. Some of the information is less than shocking. Virginians, the atlas indicates, support Democrat Joe Biden over President Donald Trump. Biden has a 56% favorability rate in the election across the state while Trump has a 41% approval rating. Locally, the atlas shows 50% of Albemarle County residents approve of Trump, even though 56% favor Biden. It is possible in the figures to both approve of Trump\u2019s performance but prefer to vote for Biden. Trump\u2019s approval rating has jumped 11% in the last week. Charlottesville residents, on the other hand, give Trump only a 23% approval rating and that rating has dropped 2% in the last week. The city residents favor Biden by 70%, according to the atlas. The site provides information on how the candidates are faring in the public view and provides fundraising totals, voting methods, spending on Facebook ads, social media sentiment and the most shared articles on social media per topic. Topics and issues that may impact an election at the last minute are included in the atlas along with rising trends. The coronavirus remains the most important on social media in Virginia with 33% of social chatter regarding the pandemic. But the virus has dropped in importance since the death of U.S. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg and the Supreme Court nomination has jumped to the second most-discussed social media topic at 16% of posts. The atlas also breaks down which candidate was mentioned more often in social media posts regarding community passion topics like abortion, guns, racism and the economy and which posts were shared the most in those topics. The social media chatter is important as it provides a context behind the polls, Kondik said. \u201cI think it is interesting to follow, but I also don\u2019t think it\u2019s at the point where one could or should base projections on it,\u201d he said. \u201cIn other words, polling is still the best way of measuring voter sentiment.\u201d","230":"Charlottesville City Council spent most of its six-hour work session Tuesday to kick off its Strategic Plan process discussing strengths, weaknesses and overall goals. The plan is a high-level document outlining the council\u2019s vision and goals over a three-year period. It is mostly abstract, with the 2018-2020 document including goals of an inclusive, self-sufficient community; healthy and safe city; beautiful environment; strong, diversified economy and a responsive organization. Mayor Nikuyah Walker called the plan a \u201cblueprint for the city\u201d and said it should be realistic and not \u201coverly ambitious.\u201d She said the city also needs a system to measure achievement toward the plan\u2019s milestones. The work session was led by Selena Cozart, a facilitator with the University of Virginia. The council conducted several exercises to focus its goals and determine the resources available to the city to achieve them. City Attorney John Blair said the city needs to emphasize collaboration with UVa, nonprofits and the private sector. Blair will take over as interim city manager on Thursday. City Manager Tarron Richardson, whose last day is Wednesday, was not part of the meeting. \u201cIt\u2019s great to have a thoughtful document but we need a document to convey not only to our staff, not only to council, not only to our next city manager, but to our residents that this is the roadmap to our community,\u201d Blair said. Deputy City Manager Paul Oberdorfer said the plan and measuring its success should have some sort of connection to the budget. \u201cIf we can\u2019t meet the goal and we have the resources, [we need to] be able to diagnose why that didn\u2019t happen and be able to determine if it\u2019s a problem with our process or workflows or if it\u2019s a problem of being understaffed,\u201d he said. In rethinking the Strategic Plan, Councilor Sena Magill said the goals should be more smoothly melded into the plan. For example, she said, COVID-19 has given the city an opportunity to reexamine its workforce model with more people working from home. Cutting down on the need for office space could reduce the city\u2019s carbon footprint, thus addressing its climate action goal. \u201cWe could look at this as really reevaluating some things that hit a lot of our major goals,\u201d she said. To kick off the meeting, councilors and city staff were asked to describe something they are proud of achieving in their tenure and any regrets they may have. Walker was proud of being able to steer conversations in a \u201cdirection it probably never would have gone before.\u201d Councilor Heather Hill highlighted her role as a conduit to different people and organizations in the community. \u201cIt\u2019s all about relationship building and earning and working to earn the trust of many people on different fronts,\u201d she said. Magill said she is proud of jumping into the role of councilor in January and learning as much as possible while being available to hearing different voices in the community and City Hall. Blair and Councilors Lloyd Snook and Michael Payne commended the city\u2019s response to the pandemic. Payne was also proud of the city\u2019s investment in rent and mortgage relief programs and support for affordable housing. Clerk of Council Kyna Thomas and Deputy City Manager Letitia Shelton said work is becoming more streamlined, which promotes better efficiency. Oberdorfer was proud to bring recognition to public works staff while improving services. For Walkers regret, appearing to refer to Richardson\u2019s departure, she said \u201cI think we spent the last few months debating about a decision we had to make.\u201d She says that she took some time away during the summer after multiple closed sessions and doesn\u2019t want to leave the community in a \u201cvulnerable position\u201d again. Hill regretted sometimes acting \u201cwith blinders on\u201d and not noticing \u201cred flags\u201d ahead of certain decisions or conversations. While he said the city has responded well to the pandemic, Snook was woebegone about its effect on other issues that have gone to the wayside, such as climate change. Magill hasn\u2019t been as engaged with the community and city staff as she was hoping to be during the campaign. For Oberdorfer\u2019s regret, he said \u201cI do regret there were times where I listened, but didn\u2019t hear.\u201d Blair said he is sorry that the city is perceived as totally dysfunctional. He said processes aren\u2019t always smooth or pretty, but there\u2019s a lot more public discussion than ther might be in other governments. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of thoughtfulness in this organization. There\u2019s a lot of debate. There\u2019s a lot of give-and-take,\u201d he said. \u201cOftentimes there\u2019s a portrayal that it\u2019s dysfunctional or it\u2019s out of control\u201d Blair hoped the city\u2019s work can be seen as a \u201crefinement process\u201d rather than dysfunctional. Thomas wanted to better unwind and said her work can result in missing family moments and not connecting better to the community. Thomas recommended recognizing staff more often for their work. Krisy Hammill, a senior budget analyst, said the city used to take nominations once a quarter of employees fulfilling some of the plan\u2019s goals. The winners would be featured in posters throughout City Hall with a short write-up. Shelton wants the city to take more problems as teachable moments. \u201cI know we want to make everyone safe and secure, but sometimes there\u2019s a limit to what we can do,\u201d she said. \u201cMy hope is that over the years we can get the council more financially savvy.\u201d Among its strengths, officials agreed that the community is very engaged in government and staff is resilient. However, they admitted not everyone takes part in the process. \u201cWe haven\u2019t been able to really make that connection and get that public engagement we want,\u201d she said. Officials briefly covered technology, which Hill said was \u201cantiquated.\u201d Shelton agreed and implied that some officials didn\u2019t want to update their systems. She said some staff haven\u2019t worked outside of the city and aren\u2019t \u201cacceptable to you bringing in outside stuff because they feel like you\u2019re stepping on what they\u2019ve been doing for so long.\u201d \u201cEven though I said earlier we have great staff, we still have some staff that are complacent that they don\u2019t want to change. So when you try to bring in new changes, they shoot them down,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s just trying to get a buy-in of those who are complacent and set and not trying to do more than they have to.\u201d Walker said for everyone to follow the plan, people need to be open to change and reevaluating themselves or their work. The council discussed some of the outside factors that would affect the plan, focusing on racial equity, leadership changes and long-term impacts of the pandemic. \u201cWe just can\u2019t forget that COVID is here,\u201d Magill said. \u201cCOVID right now is driving so much because we don\u2019t know how long it\u2019s going to last.\u201d One of the few concrete points discussed at the meeting concerned infrastructure. Snook said the council needs to plan for the financial burden of school reconfiguration. The school division wants to add sixth grade to Buford Middle School, send fifth grade back to the elementary schools and centralize preschool at Walker Upper Elementary School. Officials have said such a project would be transformative for students and help to address persistent achievement gaps and equity issues. A 2017 growth and capacity study from VMDO Architects estimated that the reconfiguration plan could cost $55 million to $80 million. Thomas and Oberdorfer pointed out that it\u2019s not just the schools as most of the city\u2019s infrastructure is aging and needs updating. \u201cTo say that the can has been kicked down the road I think is an understatement,\u201d Oberdorfer said. Last year, Richardson proposed a new 200,000-square-foot complex to house city and school administrative offices, parking, the police department, some city and Albemarle County joint services and retail space. The city sought proposals to design the building last fall, but quickly rescinded it. The city\u2019s main structure on the Downtown Mall, which currently houses council chambers and administrative offices, was built in 1925 and expanded in 1967. The police department is housed in a connected building at 606 E. Market St. constructed in 1966. Other city administration offices are in the adjacent City Hall Annex, built in 1992. Council closed by reviewing the five guiding principles of its existing plan: leadership, trust, creativity, excellence and respect. The council bounced around a few words to replace the existing structure, including stewardship, racial equity, wellness, innovation, success, accountability, integrity and collaboration. The council will work together with Blair on identifying guiding principles while Blair assembles a team to collaborate with department heads to get staff\u2019s suggestions. During public comments, speakers mostly discussed the need to center the plan on tackling climate change. Some comments were around affordable housing and access to physical and mental health services. Charles Kendig requested a way to measure outcomes from the plan, a topic supported by the council. \u201cNo matter what we put down here, we need to take that next step to make sure these values are reflected in our day-to-day operations,\u201d Magill said. \u201cHow does this become more than just a document on a piece of paper?\u201d The next work session is scheduled for 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Oct. 20. City Council will also take input during its regular meetings on Oct. 5 and Oct. 19.","231":"In announcing the restrictions, President Jim Ryan said they were not primarily due to failures to abide by the previous set of standards \u2014 as had been feared by many residents \u2014 but instead were intended to be mostly pre-emptive. That\u2019s a delicate distinction. Mr. Ryan said that most students had been doing the right thing, but that the university had received reports of large gatherings in defiance of the first set of rules. The new rules drop the number of people permitted to gather in groups from 15 to five. UVa also asked students not to leave Charlottesville for the two-week period (travel for sports is not affected), and not to invite people onto Grounds. These latter conditions might have been aimed at allaying concerns that students, having been careless about not protecting themselves from COVID, then would spread infections by visiting outside the area or welcoming visitors from outside the area. As for local residents\u2019 health, protection still depends on students\u2019 willingness to mask up and practice social distancing, since students still are able to move about the area. And why not? Having invited them back to Grounds for in-person classes, UVa would find it impractical \u2014 and probably unenforceable \u2014 to ask them to quarantine themselves on school property or within their off-Grounds apartments. The new restrictions also apply to staff, but of course everyone\u2019s attention is on students and their behavior, where the early problems were concentrated. Before the changes were announced, UVa had reported a number of cases clustered in residence halls. Those included 15 at Balz-Dobie, nine in Kellogg, five in Echols; Lefevre also was said to be affected. Shortly after the changes were announced, UVa reported that 16 students in the Hancock Residence Hall had tested positive for COVID-19. The identifications were made as a result of UVa\u2019s testing of wastewater; if COVID is detected, students must undergo individual virus tests. UVa also this week reported 22 new cases among athletes, out of 1,168 tests administered for Sept. 21-27, resulting in a low positivity rate of 1.3%. As of this writing, the university\u2019s COVID dashboard is reporting a total of 729 cases since Aug. 17, with most of those students. President Ryan said that the resumption of in-person classes does not seem to have caused a rise in virus cases. If transmissions are not occurring in classes, then the remaining possibilities would appear to be living situations and\/or social gatherings. Hence, the wastewater testing of dorms, and the pre-emptive reduction to social-gathering limits of just five people. At this writing, the tightened restrictions are set to expire at the middle of next week, but UVa has said it can extend them if necessary. It provides a sense of comfort to local residents that the university is keeping a close eye on COVID cases and the possible paths of transmission, and that tougher restrictions will stay in place if needed.","232":"Three schools \u2014 James Madison University, Virginia Tech and the University of Virginia \u2014 account for more than 3,000 of those cases. JMU, which plans to reopen its campus Monday following a monthlong shutdown, has passed 1,500, though only 60 are active. On Wednesday, Virginia Tech reported its 1,000th case since the pandemic began, and the total at the UVA is nearing 800. It took a little more than a month for the number of cases to balloon from 500 to 5,000. According to The New York Times, there have been more than 130,000 cases on college campuses nationwide. But numbers tell only part of the story. While JMU was forced to close its campus as it approached 1,000 cases, Virginia Tech has reached 1,000, and closing its campus doesn\u2019t appear imminent. Mark Owczarski, a spokesperson for the school, said Virginia Tech intends to complete the fall semester as it is currently operating but that it must remain vigilant. \u201cAs President [Timothy] Sands has said many times before, we are not out of the woods yet,\u201d Owczarski said. A university\u2019s capacity for isolating infected students goes a long way in determining its ability to keep campus open even as the number of cases climbs. JMU nearly filled its initial capacity for isolation space. But Virginia Tech has carved out more isolation space and has filled only 40% of its 210 isolation beds. UVA has filled 5% of its isolation space, and Virginia Commonwealth University has used 6%. Seeing new cases on campus was nearly inevitable, said Dr. Gonzalo Bearman, an infectious diseases specialist at VCU Health. \u201cComplete risk mitigation on a college campus to eliminate COVID-19 transmission is likely not feasible,\u201d Bearman said. Dr. Danny Avula, health director for Henrico County and Richmond, said that the hope for universities is to quickly isolate infected students to prevent widespread transmission. At some colleges, the rise of infections has slowed in recent weeks. Cases seem to have plateaued at Radford University and VCU. JMU\u2019s climb has slowed since its decision to close campus Sept. 7. While VCU saw 198 cases in the first two weeks of the semester, that number has grown by only 78 in the past four weeks. VCU President Michael Rao said the school put its faith in its students that they could act in a responsible manner. \u201cAll young people are not irresponsible. They\u2019re actually quite responsible,\u201d he said at a meeting of college presidents last month. \u201cWe had to decide whether we had some faith in them. We decided we did.\u201d Severe infection and hospitalization is uncommon among otherwise-healthy college-age people, and no Virginia college has reported a virus-related death. A student at Appalachian State University in North Carolina died recently following coronavirus-related complications. And students can also spread the virus to the community beyond campus. \u201cInfected students still play an important role in the community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection,\u201d Bearman said. Across the state, the virus\u2019s spread on college campuses has been unrelenting. Small schools are not immune; neither are rural schools. Nearly every college that opened campus this fall has reported a case. (Three colleges \u2014 Virginia State University, Randolph College and Hampton University \u2014 kept their campuses closed this semester, and not every college publishes the number of positive tests on its website.) Emory & Henry College, with an enrollment of 1,200 students, has reported just three total cases this semester, all students. Other small schools have reported small clusters: Ferrum, with an enrollment of 1,000, has reported 27. Hampden-Sydney, with an enrollment under 900, has reported 41 cases. Bridgewater, with 1,600 students, has had 35. Bluefield College has paused in-person classes twice this semester because of clusters. The school, which sits on the West Virginia border and has an enrollment of 1,200, has had 68 cases. George Mason, which has reported a vastly lower number of cases than schools of comparable size, saw its positive cases double over the past weekend from 33 to 66. Its latest count shows 71 cases. In an effort to contain the virus\u2019s spread, larger schools have begun beefing up their testing and contact tracing efforts. VCU established its own contact tracing unit, hiring eight students as part-time workers and selecting five full-time employees as supervisors. UVA is paying the Virginia Department of Health $178,000 to support seven new staff contact tracers and case investigators. Virginia Tech began randomly selecting students this week for mandatory prevalence testing. The school says it intends to test 5% of the population of students who live on campus or attend in-person classes. UVA has limited gatherings to five people and asked students not to travel out of town unless necessary. This week, it announced a short-term restricted operations plan that it will implement only if conditions worsen. The plan could involve moving most classes online, prohibiting all in-person events and restricting access to academic buildings. The school doesn\u2019t say what specific factors would trigger an implementation. Active cases, trends and how well individuals are following guidelines are all factors. \u201cThere isn\u2019t a specific figure that triggers an action,\u201d the university\u2019s statement reads. \u201cUVA has committed to closely watching a number of metrics and indicators.\u201d ekolenich@timesdispatch.com(804) 649-6109 Twitter: @EricKolenich","233":"A four-letter imperative, posted to a Lawn residence door with the University of Virginia as its direct object, has riled alumni and created a social media debate that led the university\u2019s president, rector and general counsel to defend the profane door as protected political speech. The expletive features a common English curse word followed by a list of grievances: \u201cUVa operating cost, KKKops, genocide, slavery, disability, black-brown life.\u201d Several more similar signs on Lawn doors have followed. The administration\u2019s decision to leave the signs alone, along with recent decisions to remove some statues and put into context UVa founder Thomas Jefferson\u2019s slave ownership, has upset many university supporters, both alumni and in the community. Several have accused the university and administrators of being afraid to challenge the students or liberal ideals. On Friday, UVa President Jim Ryan wrote a letter to the community saying that, while the signs are profane and offensive, they are protected by law. \u201cSome have suggested that this episode is about courage or cowardice or about politics and ideology. I respectfully disagree. I believe it is a matter of principle and the obligation, especially of universities, to protect speech even when it is offensive, and to stand firm against pressure to ignore the Constitution,\u201d Ryan wrote. Ryan noted that a Sept. 29 letter from UVa General Counsel Timothy J. Heaphy ruled the signs are protected political speech. Heaphy\u2019s letter included citations of U.S. Supreme Court rulings from the Vietnam War era that have created legal precedents in free speech law. One case, from 1971, involved the same expletive. It was ruled that, while offensive, it was part of protected political speech. \u201cObserving that one man\u2019s vulgarity is another man\u2019s lyric, the court said that the slogan at issue was not within some narrower category of unprotected speech, such as true threats, pornographic obscenity, or incitement,\u201d Heaphy wrote. \u201cThe court rejected the argument that other people in the courthouse were subjected to this speech involuntarily, reasoning that a courthouse is a public space, and anyone offended could effectively avoid further bombardment of their sensibilities simply by averting their eyes,\u201d he said. v v v Several alumni were interested in taking down the signs but said in social media posts that they were thwarted by security ambassadors placed by the school to protect the speech. A post on the Twitter page of UVa alumnus Brit Hume, a political commentator and analyst on Fox News, resulted in numerous posts from those who were opposed to the signage. Others wrote to administrators to protest their inaction. \u201cI am not sure you fully appreciate the intensity of the feelings that many of us alumni share,\u201d wrote alumnus Aubrey M. Daniel III, in a letter to Ryan earlier this week. \u201cThe Lawn is a place of honor to which [the student] brought dishonor. The university historically has been a place of honor which she has dishonored.\u201d Daniel, who successfully prosecuted U.S. Army Lt. William L. Calley Jr. for the My Lai massacre during the Vietnam War, had his letter reprinted in the Virginia politics blog Bacon\u2019s Rebellion. Daniel noted in his letter that Monticello and the UVa Academical Village are listed by the United Nations as world heritage sites. He said the doors on the Lawn are part of that site and were not designed to be \u201cugly billboards.\u201d \u201cIt is a ridiculous proposition to suggest that the First Amendment of the United States Constitution prohibits the university from maintaining and protecting the architectural beauty and harmony of the buildings on the Lawn,\u201d he wrote. Daniel said the writing on the door does not rise to the university\u2019s standards of discourse that \u201cfree exchange of ideas must be civil, respectful, courteous, and orderly.\u201d \u201cWhat is the response to \u2018FUVa\u2019? Is it \u2018don\u2019t fUVa\u2019? This is hardly the type of debate for intellectual discourse at a major university whose role is to educate and foster personal development and character,\u201d Daniel wrote. \u201cIsn\u2019t the imperfect pursuit of high ideals made more difficult if the standards of conduct used to get there are not enforced?\u201d v v v Ryan wrote that he did not condone the wording of the message, but that he would protect the right to say it. \u201cThe signs evoke a clash of values. On the one side stand the values of reasoned debate, civility and respect for the role of the Lawn in the life of the university and as a place visited by many, including young children,\u201d Ryan wrote. \u201cOn the other side stands our firm and enduring commitment to the freedom of speech and the tolerance of protest and dissent, which is at the heart of any university, including ours. This is also a constitutionally protected right, which we are bound as a public university to respect,\u201d he wrote. Ryan said he was disappointed in the signage because it ignores recent efforts toward social change. \u201cPersonally, I find the signs deeply disappointing, not simply because of their language and location, but because they fail to acknowledge any of the progress that this university has made to become more diverse, equitable and inclusive,\u201d Ryan wrote. In his opinion letter, Heaphy said the signs do not meet standards for defacement, defamation or obscenity. The inclusion of the invective does not change the fact that it was used in a political statement, qualifying for protected speech. He said the only way to ban such signs would be to ban all posters and signs on the basis of health and safety with respect to fire protection and preventing conflict. He said any immediate effort to pass such a ban could result in courts overturning it. \u201cEven if we did enact a policy that bans posters on the Lawn, I do not believe the policy applied to this particular sign would pass constitutional muster,\u201d he said. \u201cA reviewing court would look to the motive for the policy and likely conclude that this particular offensive sign was at least one substantial reason for the new policy.\u201d Ryan wrote that a ban on all signs on the Lawn is something that would be considered prior to the next academic year. \u201cWe can and will consider whether additional regulations are needed for the Lawn,\u201d he said. \u201cTime, place and manner restrictions would be legally permissible if they are narrowly tailored to protecting that environment, apply neutrally to all opinions and points of view and pre-exist any particular controversy.\u201d v v v UVa Rector James Murray on Tuesday penned a statement on behalf of the Board of Visitors that supports Ryan. Murray called the door signs \u201coffensive\u201d and \u201cdisheartening.\u201d \u201cIt is a matter of sadness and regret that those privileged to live on the Lawn wish to sully that space with insulting profanity rather than to engage in reasoned debate,\u201d Murray wrote. He said that the speech is clearly political, however, and therefore protected. \u201cSimply put, there are no exceptions to the protections afforded by the First Amendment against state attempts to regulate political speech,\u201d Murray wrote. \u201cWe are required to comply with the law, and the law is very clear.\u201d The university also has been criticized by alumni and community members for its September decision to support a Racial Equity Task Force report recommending a variety of changes to the school to make it \u201copen and welcoming to all.\u201d Among the changes proving controversial is one to put Jefferson\u2019s life in context at his statue on Grounds. \u201cThis statue, particularly in the last few years, has become a touchstone for concerns about the university\u2019s complex history with regard to race. Some members of our community have called for the removal of the statue. This idea gained greater urgency in light of the recent protests across the country this summer,\u201d Ryan wrote. \u201cI do not believe the statue should be removed, nor would I ever approve such an effort. As long as I am president, the University of Virginia will not walk away from Thomas Jefferson.\u201d Ryan said adding context to the statue means providing historical facts to help understand Jefferson and the statue\u2019s reference to his writing the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom. \u201cIt will not make judgments, but relay historical truths about his remarkable life, an effort consistent with our purpose as a university, to educate and pursue the truth,\u201d Ryan wrote. Murray said the Board of Visitors supports Ryan and other top administrators and complimented their efforts at dealing with a pandemic, converting classes to online, dealing with monetary losses due to COVID-19 and developing safety guidelines for bringing students back to Grounds all in \u201ca national climate of extremist rhetoric and unrest.\u201d Murray also credited concerned alumni for their dedication to the university. \u201cThe board will do all we can to honor these successes and make sure they continue, while we work with President Ryan and his administration to address the immediate challenges of keeping everyone healthy and school open,\u201d Murray wrote. \u201cWe see no greater evidence of the strength of our university than in the passionate, committed and heartfelt expressions of support from students, alumni\/ae, faculty and friends when they perceive us under threat,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe appreciate and applaud your devotion.\u201d","234":"Labor Day weekend, the return of University of Virginia students and the reopening of some public and private schools led to another record month for the Thomas Jefferson Health District as it deals with the COVID-19 pandemic. Yet, despite the rising case numbers, officials with the health district said they adapted quickly to those new challenges and continued to meet their goals for testing, contact tracing and case investigations. \u201cWe had all of these new moving parts that we hadn\u2019t really faced yet, and that created some new challenges as far as contact tracing and case investigation, and our messaging to all those communities,\u201d said Ryan McKay, senior policy analyst for the TJHD. \u201cI feel like we did a tremendous job to meet all those challenges.\u201d McKay said the return of students and school reopenings made case investigations and contact tracing more complex as officials tried to figure out with whom people had been in contact and to help those infected understand the process. \u201cMaking sure that people understand that no one is in trouble or we don\u2019t want a stigma around this,\u201d McKay said. \u201cI think getting that information became a little bit more difficult in September.\u201d Last month, the district recorded 1,081 new positive cases, 20 new hospitalizations and 20 new deaths, four more than August\u2019s 16 fatalities. Daily case numbers had seemed to stabilize in August when 770 new cases were reported. As of Friday, the district had 3,651 cases. The health district encompasses Charlottesville and the counties of Albemarle, Fluvanna, Greene, Louisa and Nelson. COVID-19 restrictions in Albemarle and Charlottesville remain in effect until Nov. 18. Masks are required in public and restaurants are limited to 50% occupancy indoors. As in past months, COVID-19 data from September shows the pandemic hasn\u2019t gone away and that adherence to public health precautions, such as wearing a mask, is key to slowing the spread of the virus. \u201cWearing a mask is the one thing individuals can do that we have control over that not only can provide a little bit of protection for us, but is the most important thing we can do to support our community,\u201d McKay said. \u201cWe can distance \u2014 and distancing is part of it \u2014 but it\u2019s not going to be the only thing we should do. The masking is critical.\u201d Charlottesville accounted for 52% of the new cases, with 565, according to an analysis of the health district data. People ages 10 to 29 made up 67% of the new cases. UVa reported 687 new cases among students and staff during September. Case numbers from UVa are included in the health district\u2019s data portal. McKay said throughout the pandemic, the health district has seen spikes after holidays such as Memorial Day and the Fourth of July. Following Labor Day and the reopening of schools, \u201cwe saw that influx happen relatively quickly, maybe within one or two weeks.\u201d McKay added that the district saw a similar pattern to what happened in Harrisonburg and Montgomery County after James Madison University and Virginia Tech, respectively, started the semester. \u201cWhat we were looking to, though, is that we could contain it to the extent possible and keep our positivity rate down and our incidence rate per 100,000 down in comparison to other school communities,\u201d McKay said. \u201cAnd make sure that those students \u2014 particularly those on Grounds and university students off-Grounds \u2014 have access to rooms for isolation and quarantine.\u201d UVa reported Friday that 29% of its quarantine beds are in use, while 9% of its isolation rooms are occupied. The university currently has 270 active cases, 252 of which are students. Looking at new cases per 100,000 residents is a relatively new measure that the Virginia Department of Health has publicly provided. McKay said it\u2019s a helpful metric to understand and compare community transmission across localities. Adjusting the cases per 100,000 standardizes the rate. \u201cI think even with the case incidence rate per 100,000 in Charlottesville or Albemarle, it\u2019s going to be skewed because we\u2019ve had an influx in positive cases related to university students where that may not translate to more cases community-wide,\u201d McKay said. \u201cIt just has a bigger impact on our numbers locally.\u201d Charlottesville\u2019s weekly case incidence rate has remained much higher all month compared with other localities in the district, going from 27.9 to 41.9 over the course of September. Harrisonburg\u2019s case incidence rate was 33.3, while Montgomery County\u2019s rate was 30.9 on Wednesday. In Albemarle, the weekly rate was 13.5 cases per 100,000. Greene County had the next-highest rate, at 7.9. UVa students living in university-owned housing are counted in Albemarle\u2019s numbers. The case incidence rate is one of three key measures the VDH has recommended that schools use in deciding how to reopen. The district\u2019s weekly average percent of positive cases stayed relatively stable during September, ending the month at 4.6%. For 17 days last month, the rate stayed below 5% and also consecutively declined for seven days, a new record for the district. McKay said an increase in testing, as well as slower community transmission in other counties within the district, helped to keep the positivity rate lower. UVa has ramped up its efforts to test students and to provide community testing clinics after boosting its capacity to process more tests a day. On average, there were 644 tests conducted a day during September, according to a Daily Progress analysis. During September, UVa\u2019s testing of students and employees accounted for 39% of 19,322 tests conducted in the health district. With any of the data points, McKay said it\u2019s important to look at the different metrics together and any other context, such as a recent outbreak at the Fluvanna Women\u2019s Correctional Center and UVa students returning to the area. Through contact tracing and investigating, McKay said officials can get a good sense of where community transmission is happening and how many cases can be attributed to UVa, though it\u2019s hard to truly quantify. \u201cIt gets a little trickier with Charlottesville just because there\u2019s so much interconnectedness between the university and the city,\u201d McKay said. He added that, so far, the district hasn\u2019t seen a lot of transmission between UVa and the broader community. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not happening or can\u2019t happen,\u201d he said. Looking ahead to October, McKay said the district is expecting another month of challenges as it continues to adjust to changing circumstances. He encouraged people to continue to wear masks, keep their distance from other people, avoid large gatherings and wash their hands. \u201cSo it doesn\u2019t take much,\u201d McKay said of contracting the virus. \u201cPeople need to remain vigilant. Regardless of what\u2019s happening with the university, what\u2019s happening in different businesses, understand what the risks are and the strategies that you can take to minimize that risk. \u2026 I think the important thing is if we want those students back in schools with the lowest amount of risk to the extent possible, vigilance is key.\u201d","235":null,"236":"Dr. Webb is clearly both intelligent and experienced: He has a law degree; worked for the Obama and the Trump administrations; practices internal medicine at the University of Virginia; has cared for COVID patients, and serves as the UVa Medical Center Director of Health Policy and Equity.\u00a0 What impresses us most, though, is his willingness and ability to work with people from different backgrounds to find common-sense solutions.\u00a0 As a practicing physician, Dr. Webb uses these qualities daily in caring for his patients.

The devices take samples of sewage that will be frozen, spun and analyzed for signs of viral ribonucleic acid residues that could give advance warning of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and a possible outbreak of COVID-19. \u201cThe virus\u2019 RNA is shed in stool very early in an infection, with some data showing that it\u2019s shed even before you\u2019re actively infected with the virus,\u201d said Dr. Amy Mathers, a pathologist and associate director of clinical microbiology at UVa Health. \u201cWhat we\u2019re hoping to do with the robots is capture that stool to test for the RNA. With a 24-hour sampling regimen, we can get a good snapshot of everyone who has been in that building that day.\u201d The robots \u2014 Chewbacca, Anakin, C-3PO, R2-D2 and Obi Wan \u2014 and the stool samples they snag are all part of UVa\u2019s plan to get a heads up on potential COVID-19 outbreaks on Grounds. In the effort to control the virus, the wastewater tests are used in conjunction with COVID-19 testing regimens among students and contact tracing. \u201cThere\u2019s a synergy there. We\u2019ve had incidents where there were new cases that had presented symptoms and we decided we needed to test everybody in that building, and the wastewater tests showed it was, indeed, in the population,\u201d Mathers said. \u201cWe\u2019ve also found RNA in wastewater samples of a building that no one had yet tested positive in and there were no outbreaks. We were able to go in and test people before an outbreak occurred and found some positive test results.\u201d The presence of virus RNA in wastewater is not necessarily an indication of student misbehavior, Mathers said. \u201cResidence halls are a likely place for an outbreak because these are living quarters. They are where people eat and sleep and live, and you can\u2019t wear a mask 24 hours a day,\u201d she said. \u201cThe Department of Corrections, meat packing plants, nursing homes \u2014 anywhere that people are in close proximity can lead to an outbreak. Wastewater monitoring can give us advance notice of the virus and we can get ahead of it.\u201d Digging through a day\u2019s worth of excretions on the way to a treatment plant may not be as glamorous as the white coat-clad researcher staring deeply into a test tube, but it works. \u201cSeveral studies have demonstrated that increases in SARS-CoV-2 RNA can be detected in environmental samples several days before detection of COVID-19 through clinical surveillance,\u201d an Aug. 7 status brief on the topic from the World Health Organization states. \u201cThere is potential to use environmental surveillance for early warning, particularly of clusters or outbreaks in countries that have already contained transmission and are easing public health and social measures, or in the event of seasonality,\u201d the report states. Monitoring wastewater to track viruses is not new. It\u2019s been used in the past to track down polio and other viruses around the world. In some countries, including Russia, wastewater is monitored regularly to watch for the return of polio. There have been studies in several countries, including the United States, on monitoring wastewater for the presence of illegal drugs. Although the virus sheds in mass quantities with human stool, it does not survive well in the interesting mix that is wastewater being discharged from a building into a sewage system. \u201cRNA is not a stable molecule, so the samples and testing all have to be done on site. We have to keep the samples really, really cold and we create a composite sample and spin it in an ultra-centrifuge and then try to identify the RNA,\u201d Mathers explained. \u201cSo far, no one has detected viable virus RNA in wastewater, although I\u2019m not saying it hasn\u2019t happened ever,\u201d she said. \u201cThat makes me feel comfortable about the safety of the collection and testing process.\u201d For UVa, the process was in practice prior to the students\u2019 return. \u201cWe spent our summer trying to figure out how to do this,\u201d Mathers said. \u201cWe tried grab samples. We took samples we knew should test positive and let them sit for a while. We sent it to an external lab for tests and found that they didn\u2019t test positive at all. That convinced us of the need to do it here.\u201d Mathers and the sample team also worked with the Virginia Department of Health to monitor wastewater from nursing homes during outbreaks. They tested student-athlete dorms when the players returned in July, comparing their results with the regular testing of the athletes. \u201cWe were able to validate the process,\u201d Mathers said. \u201cBy the time the students came back to Grounds, we had ironed out the kinks.\u201d If the passive surveillance of sewage works for UVa, it might work for the community at large. According to WHO, the Netherlands plans to incorporate daily sewage surveillance into its national COVID-19 monitoring, and similar approaches are being considered in Germany. Australia and New Zealand already have started programs, the organization stated in its status update. \u201cConceivably, you could set up monitoring at the Rivanna Water & Sewer Authority to get an idea of how prevalent the virus is in the area,\u201d Mathers said. \u201cThat could show a surge is coming before it happens.\u201d","238":"The Albemarle County School Board on Thursday will hear a proposal Thursday to move the division to Stage Three of its reopening plan, meaning preschoolers through third-graders could go to class twice a week starting Nov. 9. School Superintendent Matt Haas discussed his recommendation Wednesday at a news conference. He cited the results of a recent parent survey, the implementation of recommended mitigation strategies and the lack of widespread outbreaks in schools that have offered in-person classes as key factors in his decision. \u201cWhat makes me confident that our students and staff are safe in our schools is the data I collected from Region V,\u201d he said, referring to the state education region that Albemarle County is part of. \u201cWith 20 school systems and 23,000 students attending daily, there have been three outbreaks since school started.\u201d Since the first day of school, fewer than five employees and no students have tested positive for COVID-19 and the cases have not been connected to the schools, Haas said. \u201cThe quick and responsible action by our employees and our health department when an employee has tested positive proves that high quality and reliable contact tracing not only is possible in our division but it is working,\u201d he said. The Thomas Jefferson Health District handles all case investigations but works with the school divisions in that effort. As of Wednesday, there were no outbreaks in K-12 schools, according to the health district. The School Board is aware of the recommendation, and Haas said he wanted to announce it before Thursday\u2019s meeting so parents, teachers and others would know what\u2019s on the table for discussion. About 65% of parents said in a survey that closed Tuesday that they would send their students back to school, and 43.6% reported that their students haven\u2019t been as successful academically this year. But 60% of teachers said the division should continue with all virtual classes and 93% said they have been somewhat to highly effective with virtual learning. Under Stage Three, about 5,000 students would be eligible for in-person classes or access to the buildings. Parents can continue with all-virtual classes, though though the specifics of that plan are still in the works. The division said in a presentation that the hybrid schedule will allow for half of the student population in the building at once, making the transition to face-to-face classes easier as well as the implementation of health protocols such as social distancing and the daily COVID-19 screenings. Masks will be required. Students will be kept in small groups during the school day and eat meals together, though Haas didn\u2019t say at what number those groups would be capped at. The class size will be determined by the space in the classroom as well as the number of students who opt for in-person classes. Students in high school can participate in athletics or in-person extracurricular activities upon approval. Schools have to submit a plan to the division for each sport and activity. In-person access to online classes will continue for two groups of students with disabilities, English Language Learners and those in fourth through 12th grade who have exhibited a lack of engagement in the virtual experience. Additionally, students in sixth grade and older will continue with all virtual classes. The division said on its Return to School webpage that principals are working with staff to set explicit criteria for lack of engagement. \u201cGenerally, schools will rely on attendance and completion of assignments as key indicators of engagement,\u201d the division said on the webpage. \u201cTeachers will refer students who demonstrate a lack of engagement to a committee for consideration.\u201d Local COVID-19 numbers As of Thursday, Albemarle County has had 172 new cases of COVID-19 per 100,000 residents over the last 14 days. That case incidence rate is considered higher risk by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The county\u2019s percent of positive cases over the last two weeks \u2014 another CDC core indicator \u2014 is at 5.1%, which is considered moderate risk. \u201cResearch tells us that this number is being significantly influenced by what is happening at [the University of Virginia] and not in our schools,\u201d Haas said, adding that the Thomas Jefferson Health District supports the division\u2019s plan. When deciding to start the school year online, officials in Albemarle and Charlottesville school divisions said they were concerned about the return of UVa students and how that would affect local case numbers. UVa has reported 840 cases among students so far, accounting for 90% of all affiliated cases. On Tuesday, the university extended restrictions on travel and the size of gatherings for another two weeks in order to curb the spread of the virus. The division has identified six factors, though no specific metrics, to use in making a decision about moving to another stage. Haas said none of those factors currently prevent a move to Stage Three. \u201cExperience has shown that this board\u2019s measured approach on July 30 was the right step, and it tells us now that this is the right time to take another measured step forward,\u201d Haas said. Neither the factors nor the current plan calls for regular COVID-19 testing of employees and students. The Albemarle Education Association, which represents county teachers, has proposed health benchmarks for each stage based on information from Harvard\u2019s Global Health Institute, federal guidance and other analysis. Current conditions don\u2019t meet the association\u2019s standard for Stage Three. In July, after the division proposed a two-day schedule for all students, teachers pushed back on that plan, citing fears of the virus and concerns about the quality of in-person learning that follows mitigation measures such as social distancing. That outcry led officials to draft an online-only plan. Haas said that he understands the fear among staff and that there are many legitimate concerns out there about health and safety. \u201cObviously, everyone should take the virus seriously,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will not be able to do this effectively unless everyone in our community practices the CDC recommended strategies: wearing masks, sanitizing your hands, washing your hands, social distancing and staying away from big crowds.\u201d Haas said the division will have enough staff members to make Stage Three possible. About 40% of teachers said they would request to continue teaching remotely and 11% said they would request a leave of absence if required to work in person. About 47% of the 610 classified staff who responded to the survey said they would request to work remotely, primarily because of health or childcare-related reasons. Staff members who work with preschool through third-graders will be working in the buildings along with some special education teachers and teaching assistants, English as a Second Language teachers and those working in the childcare program or as learning coaches. Most of the division\u2019s licensed staff, which includes teachers, responded to the survey while 6,413 parents took the survey. The results provided Wednesday did not break down answers by a parent\u2019s race, socioeconomic status or the grade of their children, because that information wasn\u2019t collected. Parents of students in third-grade or younger made up 39% of the respondents. Several area school divisions have reopened under a similar hybrid model. Charlottesville City Schools has not yet made a decision about the second quarter.","239":"RICHMOND \u2014 At Virginia Tech, students file into Lane Stadium each day to be tested for the coronavirus. These students don\u2019t have symptoms, but because they were randomly selected and compelled to undergo a test, they line up below the luxury suites and receive a nasal swab. Any student who refuses is referred to the office of student conduct. In Richmond, Virginia Commonwealth University takes a different approach: Students who participate in testing are rewarded with a $10 Amazon gift card. When the school needed more students to participate in testing last month, it set up a station outside a large dorm and asked students walking by to take a test. Large colleges in Virginia are testing a percentage of their student bodies in an effort to slow the spread of the coronavirus, but they are divided about whether to use incentives or punishment to ensure students take part. It\u2019s a practice often referred to as surveillance testing. Colleges pick students at random and test them, hoping to ferret out asymptomatic carriers before they unwittingly pass the virus to another person. At Virginia Tech and the University of Virginia, students who are selected are required to accept. They are given the flexibility to schedule the test at their convenience. Both schools also take samples of waste water outside dorms to look for signs of the virus. Lindsay Wiley, a professor of public health law at American University, said mandatory testing of college students is likely legal. While there isn\u2019t court precedent to point to, public health law experts generally agree that compulsory testing is constitutional if it\u2019s reasonably necessary to prevent the spread of a serious disease, Wiley said. Other universities in the state have taken a less absolute stance. George Mason University requires testing among only its on-campus residents but allows off-campus students to decline. James Madison permits students who wish not to be tested to request an exemption, which is considered on a case-by-case basis. Failure to show for a test, JMU said, may result in a hold being placed on the student\u2019s account, which can restrict the student from registering for future classes. The decision to make testing optional at VCU was made early in the reopening process and isn\u2019t set in stone, said school spokesman Michael Porter. VCU began surveillance testing earlier than other colleges and could still decide to make it mandatory, he said. At Virginia Tech, students who live off campus initially weren\u2019t required to take part in testing. Now they are. On Virginia Tech\u2019s website, on a question and answer page, the school addressed the query: \u201cHow can Virginia Tech make testing mandatory when it wasn\u2019t able to at the beginning of the year?\u201d The school\u2019s answer? In essence, it had changed its mind. \u201cThe science and the public health guidance continues to evolve,\u201d the answer read. \u201cWe have determined at this time that this is the right practice, and it is legal and appropriate given the pandemic and public health emergency we are currently managing.\u201d In mid-September, Virginia Tech got a visit from Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus response coordinator. She encouraged the university to test its student body more often \u2014 up to 1,000 tests a day if possible. Virginia Tech is one of the few colleges in the country that conducts its own coronavirus tests. Through the Fralin Biomedical Research Institute in Roanoke, Tech can administer 2,000 tests a week, and it currently aims to test 1,340 students, or 5% of the student population, every seven days. The decision to make testing mandatory came as part of an ongoing discussion between the university, the New River Health District and the New River Task Force on COVID, which is composed of school districts, first responders and health providers in the area, said Mark Owczarski, a spokesman for Virginia Tech. \u201cAt the end of the day, we are facing, and have been facing for several months now, a public health crisis, and our decisions are guided by what is best for public health (something Virginia Tech has stressed from the beginning),\u201d Owczarski said. \u201cIn the end, we believe we are making the best decisions we can.\u201d In general, colleges can set their own admissions and retention policies as long as they are not discriminatory, said Michael A. Olivas, who retired from the University of Houston Law Center. Because the act of attending college isn\u2019t mandatory, the way K-12 education is, a reasonable required testing policy likely would be upheld in court. \u201cIn a public health crisis, colleges have stronger hands to require mandatory testing \u2014 perhaps with some religious or medical exceptions, but narrowly construed,\u201d Olivas said. Virginia Tech students, by and large, have participated in the required testing, Owczarski said. While a few have voiced dissent, overall, he said, the program is going as well as administrators had hoped. There\u2019s another tool in universities\u2019 toolbox for limiting the spread of the virus: punishing students who violate the rules, such as by hosting a party and inviting a big crowd. On Sept. 10, JMU said it had begun proceedings for 146 cases against students for possible rule violations. Administrators have worried that students will avoid being tested because a positive test could reveal that they violated a rule on gathering. At UVa, President Jim Ryan said students won\u2019t get in trouble for testing positive. If a student records a positive test, the information provided to contact tracers won\u2019t be used for punishing students, UVa spokesman Brian Coy said. Limiting the virus requires students cooperating fully with public health measures, and the university won\u2019t take any action that would discourage cooperation. Besides, the university has other means of identifying and investigating violations of school policy, Coy said.","240":"University of Virginia students suffering stress, anxiety and internet connectivity troubles in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic will have the option of receiving course credit without a letter grade, school officials have decided. The move allows students to choose a credit\/general credit\/no credit grading system rather than the usual letter grading system. Classes taken under the credit system will not impact grade point average. The move, made by administrators on Friday, came in the wake of student efforts to make the change, including online petitions, lobbying and a resolution by the UVa Student Council. \u201cThis summer we announced a return to regular grading for fall 2020 because we believed that the exceptional circumstances last spring that prompted the mid-semester change in grading policy were not likely to recur,\u201d UVa Provost Liz Magill wrote Friday in an open letter to students, faculty and staff. That, she said, proved to not be the case. \u201cWe decided to revisit our grading decision after many exchanges with students, student leaders, and faculty and staff who work most closely with students,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThey reported high levels of stress, anxiety, and personal and family challenges among large numbers of students, and all encouraged both the deans and me to consider flexible grading options this semester.\u201d She said a decision regarding grading options for the spring 2021 semester will be announced in early December. Student Council members said in a letter posted Saturday on social media that they \u201ccelebrate\u201d the change. \u201cWhile it is not the specific policy we had worked for, we are glad that there is now a system in place that will provide students some of the flexibility they need to navigate this incredibly challenging semester,\u201d members wrote. Council leaders said the change is welcomed, but that UVa officials should consult with students when deciding how to grade courses in the next semester. \u201cThis win is a reminder that student self-governance done right is fundamentally about the collective bargaining power of students,\u201d student council members wrote. \u201cWhile we are grateful that the administration listened to students on this issue, it is important to emphasize that the administration must consult students before putting policies in place.\u201d Under the new grading option, UVa students may change methods for undergraduate classes not yet complete. They may do so between Nov. 2 and Nov. 6. Last spring, the university switched students to the credit\/no credit program in the face of the pandemic, but students will need to make the change themselves for the remainder of the current semester, officials said. If a change to the credit\/no credit system is not made by the student, the class will be graded with letter grades as usual. Magill said university deans agreed unanimously to the changes. \u201cWhile no decision about grading will be welcomed by all, on balance, this solution seemed the most targeted to the legitimate and serious concerns raised by students, faculty, and staff, without changing the grading system in ways that would have additional consequences for students and faculty who are relying on giving or receiving standard grades,\u201d she said. According to administrators, the for-credit system has three rankings. A CR, or credit received, is given to students who meet all class requirements, basically a C-grade or higher. A GC, or general credit, is given for passing scores below a C-grade. NC, or no credit, is awarded for class performance that would, in a letter-grade system, score an F. The option applies only to undergraduate students. Law, business and medical school students are affected by the change. UVa will include a notation on transcripts that the credit option was offered during the COVID-19 crisis.","241":"The pandemic is not only contagious and dangerous, but when it comes to celebrating holidays, it just isn\u2019t much fun. Coronavirus concerns, coupled with recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, led the University of Virginia to close the coffin on this year\u2019s Trick-or-Treating on the Lawn event. A tradition since the 1980s for both Lawn residents and area families, the event has grown in scope and stature to become a popular meeting of the local and university communities. Not this year, officials announced Monday. \u201cTrick-or-Treating on the Lawn is one of our favorite events of the year,\u201d said Moriah Hendrick, head resident of the Lawn. \u201cFor Lawn residents and all other UVa students, it represents a chance to welcome the larger Charlottesville community and celebrate the connections we share.\u201d In 2019, Lawn residents and members of student organizations were stationed in each of the 54 Lawn rooms as well as rooms on the West Range to give out treats donated and distributed by some 70 student groups and organizations. Students and faculty also handed out books and provided children and adults with sensory sensitivities some friendly spaces to be during the event. The university even offered free parking for families attending the event in the University Hall and John Paul Jones Arena parking lots and in the Arts Grounds garage on Culbreth Road. But the COVID-19 pandemic, outbreaks in the community and on Grounds, and recommendations from national public health experts led to the event\u2019s demise. \u201cRosh Hashanah, Yom Kippur, Halloween, D\u00eda de Los Muertos, Navratri, Diwali, and Thanksgiving will likely need to be different this fall to prevent the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19,\u201d CDC officials said in a Sept. 20 post on the organization\u2019s website. \u201cMany traditional Halloween activities can be high-risk for spreading viruses. There are several safer, alternative ways to participate in Halloween.\u201d CDC officials said high risk activities include traditional trick-or-treating where treats are handed to children who go door to door; events where treats are handed out from trunks of cars lined up in large parking lots; crowded costume parties; indoor haunted houses; and hayrides or tractor rides. As low-risk options, the CDC recommends carving or decorating pumpkins with family or outdoors with neighbors providing there is proper social distancing and mask wearing; decorating your home; walking from house to house admiring Halloween decorations at a distance; virtual Halloween costume contests; family scary movie night; and family-only around-the-house trick-or-treating. Moderate-risk options presented by the CDC include one-way trick-or-treating with individually wrapped goodie bags to grab-and-go while continuing to social distance; small group, socially distanced open-air costume parades; outdoor costume parties providing protective masks and social distancing are in place; and an open-air, one-way, walk-through haunted forest where appropriate mask use is enforced, and people can remain more than 6 feet apart. \u201cIf screaming will likely occur, greater distancing is advised. The greater the distance, the lower the risk of spreading a respiratory virus,\u201d officials wrote. Officials also noted that costume masks are not substitutes for cloth masks. \u201cA costume mask should not be used unless it is made of two or more layers of breathable fabric that covers the mouth and nose and doesn\u2019t leave gaps around the face,\u201d officials wrote. \u201cDo not wear a costume mask over a protective cloth mask because it can be dangerous if the costume mask makes it hard to breathe. Instead, consider using a Halloween-themed cloth mask.\u201d Hendrick said the increased popularity of the trick-or-treat tradition makes it more likely to have a large crowd on the Lawn and in the room doorways. \u201cWhile this cancellation is disappointing, we also recognize that the most important way to care for the community at this time is by ensuring that we can all stay as safe as possible,\u201d Hendrick said.","242":"University of Virginia students living in residence halls will be tested for COVID-19 at least every nine days and those living off-Grounds will be given kits to test themselves, university officials announced on Tuesday. The increase in testing was announced at the same time UVa officials relaxed social gathering restrictions, allowing students to gather in groups of up to 10 as opposed to groups of five. Requirements that students wear masks, limit visitors and unnecessary travel remain in effect, as do recommendations for public health measures such as physical distancing and hand washing. The restrictions were put in place late last month after the number of positive tests among students rose. \u201cWhen first announced, these enhanced restrictions were a necessary response to worrying trends in the university\u2019s viral metrics,\u201d said Allen W. Groves, UVa Dean of Students, in a Tuesday letter to students. \u201cToday our metrics are much better, and we are confident that members of this community can gather in slightly larger numbers without risking the health of each other or our community.\u201d According to information released by UVa on its COVID Tracker dashboard, COVID cases at the university have dropped significantly from an average of 22 diagnosed per day three weeks ago to three per day last week. There were 95 active cases of COVID reported at UVa last week, 74 of which were students. Two weeks ago about 7.8% of students tested proved positive. Last week about 2% of UVa students tested were positive for the virus. The positive rate for tests in the Greater Charlottesville area covered by the Thomas Jefferson Health District as of last week was 3.2%, according to district statistics. \u201cIt is true that an increase in testing will likely yield an increase in the number of positive cases on the UVa COVID Tracker,\u201d Groves wrote. \u201cI want to assure you that university leaders and public health experts are monitoring these metrics closely and any future policy decisions will be informed by the totality of the situation regarding the virus and our capacity to respond to it.\u201d According to UVa officials, occupants of each residence hall will be tested as a group. Larger residence halls will have students tested over several days. Tests will be based on either a nasal swab or a saliva sample and students will receive an email with information about their testing appointment, including the time, day, location and testing method, officials said. Students living off-Grounds will receive test kits from UVa contracts. Those tests will be supplemented by saliva tests performed by the university. The testing, administrators said, is mandatory. Students with \u201cunavoidable conflicts,\u201d such as classes or being isolated or quarantined for exposure to COVID-19 may reschedule. Students who tested positive for the virus will need to wait 90 days from the past positive test. Results should be available in one to two days and those who test positive will move into isolation housing on Grounds. The Virginia Department of Health will conduct contact tracing for any positive cases. \u201cWe have heard from many of you about the strain these new restrictions have added to an already challenging semester,\u201d Groves wrote to students. \u201cI hope this change will make it a little easier to make the most of the remainder of this academic term.\u201d Groves said that restrictions could be re-imposed if the virus gains a foothold and positive tests increase. \u201cOur behavior can impact the trajectory of this virus for better or worse,\u201d Groves wrote. \u201cFinishing this semester strong will require everyone to consistently follow current policy and advice to limit gathering size, visitors and unnecessary travel, wear masks, and maintain physical distancing.\u201d On Sept. 22, UVa President Jim Ryan implemented restrictions that limited the number of students who could gather from 15 to five. All students were to wear face coverings unless at home, eating or exercising outdoors. The university also ordered students to not leave Charlottesville unless necessary and to not have visitors from out of town. It also began testing students living off-Grounds for COVID and targeted residence halls for testing based on the test results and wastewater tests for the virus\u2019 ribonucleic acid, a building block of the virus. Those efforts will continue, officials said. The increase in testing is designed to stymie the virus before it can spread enough to create an outbreak. The virus is easily transmitted in living quarters with people in close proximity. \u201cPeople can be infected with COVID before they feel ill or begin to show symptoms,\u201d UVa administrators wrote in a letter to students on Tuesday. The letter was signed by several of the school\u2019s top administrators, including Provost Liz Magill. \u201cTransmission can occur unnoticed and can spread when people live together,\u201d the administrators wrote. \u201cRegular testing will help identify asymptomatic students in residence halls before the virus has a chance to spread widely.\u201d","243":"More than 1,500 students at James Madison University have tested positive for the coronavirus in the past two months. Two other universities in the state, Virginia Tech and the University of Virginia, have reported 1,000 cases or more each. And yet, other large universities in Virginia have claimed dramatically fewer infected students. At VCU, about 300 have tested positive, according to the school\u2019s online dashboard. George Mason and Old Dominion have reported fewer than 100 cases each. There are numerous factors that begin to explain the discrepancy: the number of tests the schools have administered, the spread of the virus in the community before the students ever arrived and, of course, the behavior of its students. Data from the colleges and the Virginia Department of Health suggest that the colleges with a low number of cases may not be doing as well as you\u2019d think. And at the same time, the schools with high numbers may not be doing as poorly as you\u2019d think. \u201cIt is probably na\u00efve to assume that some large universities didn\u2019t have the social gatherings and outbreaks the others did,\u201d said Dr. Noelle Bissell, director of the New River Health District in southwestern Virginia. The number of positive cases reported by each school doesn\u2019t tell the whole story, she said. If a university conducts fewer tests, fewer positive results will occur. George Mason, which has 39,000 students, has conducted 6,000 student tests. VCU, with 29,000 students, has completed about 7,000. UVA, meanwhile, has administered almost 35,000, and Virginia Tech has tested its community more than 21,000 times. Virginia Tech has an advantage in that it processes its own COVID tests. Most universities sign a contract with a private business to transport their tests to a lab, run them and return the results. There\u2019s no standard for how colleges count their cases, either. At UVA, only positive tests that occur on campus are reflected in the school\u2019s total number. That means if a UVA student leaves campus, receives a test at a nearby drug store and produces a positive result, that positive test won\u2019t be counted by UVA. Virginia Tech has reported about 1,200 cases at its health center, but Montgomery County, which encompasses the campus, has reported 1,587 cases among individuals age 18-24. The actual number of infected students is likely even higher than that, Bissell said. A substantial number of people aren\u2019t getting tested if they are asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic. At JMU, every student is counted. Of JMU\u2019s 1,500 positive cases listed on the school\u2019s dashboard, about 60% occurred off campus and were reported to the university by the student. There is another reason to believe that JMU, with the highest count of infected students in the state, isn\u2019t doing as badly as the numbers and its temporary closure of campus this semester suggest. The degree of transmission of the virus on campus can reflect the degree of underlying community transmission, said Dr. Gonzalo Bearman, an infectious disease specialist at VCU. If a community that houses a university had a high level of transmission before students arrived, when the students did arrive, the school started at a disadvantage. \u201cThe greater the community transmission, the greater the campus transmission,\u201d Bearman said. On Aug. 15, before students had arrived on campus, JMU\u2019s community had already experienced a high level of transmission. In Harrisonburg, where JMU is located, 2% of the population had been infected with the virus, a high percentage, according to population estimates by the University of Virginia\u2019s Weldon Cooper Center for Public Service. Conversely, in Montgomery County, where Virginia Tech is located, only 0.3% of residents had been infected. In Fairfax City, which is adjacent to George Mason\u2019s campus, 0.4% of the population had been infected. But there\u2019s also reason to believe JMU is doing worse than the numbers suggest. The university has conducted only 3,600 tests since July, fewer than other large colleges in the state. While testing is an important element of containing the virus on campus, it is just one piece to a college\u2019s virus-containment puzzle. How well a college contact traces, places infected students in isolation, disseminates a steady stream of messaging to students about following safety practices and punishes offenders all have an impact on how much the virus spreads, Bearman said. Last month, Virginia Tech president Timothy Sands said he had learned that testing isn\u2019t a panacea. \u201cIt\u2019s a tool to help the other measures work more efficiently, but you can rely too heavily on it,\u201d Dr. Mitch Rosner, chair of the UVA Department of Medicine, told UVA\u2019s news website. George Mason green-lighted a \u201cDo your part\u201d campaign to encourage students to follow health guidelines. JMU has investigated 345 students for possible rules violations and has found 189 of them responsible. Two of them have been suspended, a school spokeswoman said. VCU has 307 cases and has found 143 students responsible for noncompliance, a school spokesperson said. Seventy-three cases are still pending. A spokesperson at UVA declined to provide the number cases of noncompliance, and a Virginia Tech spokesman said the school\u2019s number wouldn\u2019t be compiled until later in the semester. One of the biggest factors in determining a college\u2019s positive case count is the most unquantifiable: student behavior. When JMU closed its campus just a week after classes began, it cited off-campus social gatherings as a driver of the virus. When Virginia State announced its intention to open campus for the spring of 2021, president Makola Abdullah said that on-campus interaction isn\u2019t as big a worry as what students do when they\u2019re off campus. Before they moved into dorms throughout the state, most college students were required to be tested. Across all schools, the percent positivity was less than 0.5%, Bissell said. Meaning each student body arrived on campus equally infected. What happened after those students arrived determined the school\u2019s fate. In Montgomery county, positive cases among children, middle-age adults and older adults are scarce. Of all the county\u2019s cases since the beginning of August \u2013 about 1,900 \u2013 85% have come from college-age individuals.","244":"Charlottesville COVID-19 cases have surpassed Albemarle County cases as the University of Virginia case numbers have dropped. According to data compiled by the Thomas Jefferson Health District, as of Friday, there were 4,114 cases in the district, up from 3,651 cases two weeks prior. Of the positive cases, 1,499 are in Charlottesville, which has surpassed Albemarle County which currently has 1,466 cases. The health district encompasses Charlottesville and the counties of Albemarle, Fluvanna, Greene, Louisa and Nelson. There isn\u2019t one particular event that caused an increase in COVID-19 numbers in Charlottesville, THJD Spokesperson Kathryn Goodman said, though the district has seen an increase in off-grounds UVa cases. According to the health district\u2019s COVID dashboard, Charlottesville surpassed Albemarle County in case number on Oct. 8. UVa reported Thursday that 9% of its quarantine beds are in use, while 6% of its isolation rooms are occupied. Two weeks prior, the university reported that 29% of its quarantine beds were in use and 9% of its isolation rooms were occupied. The university currently has 105 active cases, 78 of which are students. This significant decrease from numbers two weeks ago, which showed UVa had 270 active cases, 252 of which were students. Case numbers from UVa are included in the health district\u2019s data portal. Though daily case numbers are trending downward in the district, Goodman emphasized caution as the holiday season approaches. With Halloween two weeks away and Thanksgiving a few weeks after that, the health district is planning to offer more testing in Charlottesville and the surrounding counties on a routine basis throughout November. Testing will be offered in each county the district encompasses as well as additional events in Charlottesville the week before Thanksgiving, Goodman said. During the week of November 16, the health district will be hosting an event every day in a different locality in the health district. Goodman said they anticipate that results from the last round of testing that week would come in by Nov. 23 at the latest. \u201cThe important thing for people to know, though, is that if you go and get tested a week before Thanksgiving, that test result [is] for a moment in time,\u201d Goodman said. \u201cSo really, you have the potential to be exposed after that if you choose not to stay quarantined until you go to see your family for Thanksgiving.\u201d Holidays present the opportunity for higher exposure via social interactions, Goodman said, pointing to an increase the district saw around July 4. Though they don\u2019t plan to turn anyone away, Goodman cautioned that their tests are limited and the health district plans to focus on people who are high-risk individuals or work in a situation where they could be potentially exposed. With the more immediate future in mind, the health district has released guidance for those looking to trick or treat this year. Recommendations, which can be found on the health district\u2019s website, include: staying home if you are sick or have been exposed; handing out candy in individual bags; standing six feet away, when possible; hanging signs to let trick or treaters know if you are handing out candy; and, of course, wearing masks. \u201cHalloween is such a social holiday, it\u2019s often a time that families gather together on sidewalks and walk from house to house together,\u201d Goodman said. \u201c Instead, this year what we recommend is that people limit the number of neighborhoods they\u2019re going to so if you choose to trick or treat, make sure you\u2019re following extra safety precautions and stay just in your neighborhood and use hand sanitizer.\u201d","245":"University of Virginia students can expect their spring semester to look much like the fall with a mix of online and in-person classes and restrictions on the size of student gatherings, face mask requirements and a regimen of regular COVID-19 testing, officials announced Thursday. They can also expect a shortened spring break with shorter breaks scattered throughout the semester as encouragement to limit travel out of the area, officials said. The spring semester will begin Feb. 1 and end May 6. \u201cThe plans we are announcing today reflect the need to remain cautious in the face of a historic pandemic,\u201d UVa Provost Liz Magill and Chief Operating Officer J.J. Davis said in a message to faculty, staff and student \u201cThey also reflect our confidence in the capacity of this university and its people to continue to limit the spread and keep each other safe.\u201d According to information released by the school, the university will offer as many in-person college life experiences \u201cas it safely can.\u201d With the exceptions of lab courses or practical courses, each class is expected to have an online version for those students who wish to learn from home or are in isolation or quarantine. \u201cThe number of teaching days will be very similar to the fall semester, but we will push the start date back to reduce the time students are living and learning together during flu season,\u201d the administrators wrote. The decision comes as viral video of often maskless students crammed into Corner clubs has made its way around social media. Thomas Jefferson Health District officials have said they are looking into the videos to determine what action may be taken against the venues. UVa officials said they investigate complaints against students to determine if policy requirements were violated and appropriate penalties. UVa officials on Thursday said that spring break will be broken into small academic respites scattered about the semester. \u201cIn order to limit travel to and from Charlottesville, the traditional week-long spring break will be replaced by multiple, shorter breaks for students to rest and recharge in the midst of a stressful semester,\u201d the administrators wrote. \u201cStudents will be encouraged to stay in the area in order to limit the spread of the virus.\u201d The dates of the breaks will be announced later, they said. The decision is similar to plans rolled out at Virginia Tech to give five one-day breaks instead of the traditional weeklong break in March. The traditional break has also been cancelled by Virginia Commonwealth University and the University of Richmond. Other universities across the country have also shortened or eliminated spring breaks for similar concerns. On-campus students returning to Virginia Tech for spring semester must get tested for COVID-19 when residence halls reopen Jan. 16 and all classes will be online from Jan. 19 when they begin to Jan. 22. That will allow Virginia Tech officials to review results. Tech officials are asking all students to quarantine themselves for 14 days before coming back to campus. UVa spokesman Brian Coy said administrators are currently working out the details of pre-semester COVID testing for UVa students and that specifics will be announced later. UVa\u2019s current academic semester ends Nov. 24 with final exams to be conducted online in December. Every student living in university housing will be tested for the virus before the Thanksgiving holiday. \u201cAs Thanksgiving break approaches, UVa is planning to offer every student a COVID-19 test before they leave,\u201d Magill and Davis said in the message. \u201cOn Grounds students will take pre-departure tests through the student population testing program. UVa will provide off-Grounds students with the same [test kits] used for pre-arrival testing over the summer. We may offer some off-Grounds students saliva tests as capacity allows.\u201d UVa this week also increased its random, asymptomatic testing of students living off-Grounds, and is now using saliva screening, in addition to testing kits to test off-Grounds students. Because of changes to class schedules created by COVID-19, UVa students are eligible to take for free a January term course. Those courses begin Jan. 4 and end Jan. 15. All courses will be online. UVa officials said the spring semester will see every person who comes onto Grounds being required to wear a mask, avoid large social gatherings, practice physical distancing and adhere to testing requirements. Students are currently tested every nine days if they live in residence halls. Wastewater testing outside of residence halls is being used to screen for potential COVID-19 cases before the students become symptomatic, helping decrease transmission of the virus. Students living off Grounds will be given test kits to perform their own tests. Tests are also available at the university student health clinics. \u201cThanks to you, we have seen case counts fall in our community and our region recently \u2013 but other regions of the country are experiencing surges,\u201d the administrators said in their message. \u201cWe are monitoring the progression of the virus closely and will make changes if necessary.\u201d Officials also announced on Thursday that graduation ceremonies for both the class of 2020, which was canceled by the pandemic, and class of 2021 will be determined by March 15. Finals weekend for 2021 graduates is currently scheduled for May 21 through May 23, and May 28 through May 30 for 2020 graduates.","246":"Hamilton\u2019s conversation is one of several available as part of this year\u2019s mostly virtual festival, which is bringing a diverse slate of on-demand films and filmmakers to audiences\u2019 homes this year in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. While events and panels featuring performers of Hamilton\u2019s caliber usually draw sold-out crowds to the Paramount Theater and other venues in Charlottesville, the nature of this year\u2019s format has led to more subdued and intimate conversations. Chatting by video, Hamilton was joined by Ryan and UVa law school alumna Julie Lynn, who worked with Hamilton as a producer on \u201cTerminator: Dark Fate.\u201d \u201cDark Fate,\u201d which was released in theaters last year, was the first time Hamilton had played the role of Conner since \u201cTerminator 2: Judgment Day\u201d 27 years prior. Hamilton said she had no ideas of grandeur when she initially took on the role for 1984\u2019s \u201cTerminator\u201d and that she did not have the luxury to be choosy with her roles. She said she certainly never expected to become an icon of female empowerment in action films and doesn\u2019t think of herself as an icon, though she is glad to have made an impact in Hollywood\u2019s representation of female action heroes. \u201cI\u2019m lucky enough to not think about myself in those terms because I think that would be a terrible thing to try to live up to, and to be this sort of monolith of female empowerment,\u201d she said. \u201cMy answer is to always try to neutralize that, because I want to play all kinds of women.\u201d Returning as Conner in 2019\u2019s \u201cDark Fate\u201d was \u2014 in addition to being physically arduous \u2014 mentally difficult, Hamilton said. However, she opted to join the film after deciding that she could \u201cbring some fire\u201d to the role. \u201cI had to go into my deepest sorrow and disappointment every day because that\u2019s who [Sarah Conner] is,\u201d Hamilton said. \u201cShe\u2019s disappointed in humanity and she\u2019s just lost and fierce, so there\u2019s no way to avoid doing the deep painful work in order to bring that to the screen.\u201d It was on the set of \u201cDark Fate\u201d that Hamilton met Lynn. Lynn said she joined the film during preproduction with the intention of being hands-on. Once on set, she said she was impressed with Hamilton\u2019s dedication to the role. \u201c[Hamilton] may not be a method actor in the way we think of method acting, but she goes inside and it was like watching a hand go into a glove that had been made bespoke for it,\u201d Lynn said. \u201cShe was in incredible physical condition, but also she just knew that character \u2014 there was no needing to be told who she was.\u201d Hamilton said she relied on her two female co-stars \u2014 Mackenzie Davis and Natalia Reyes \u2014 to get through the difficult shoot, something she said she wasn\u2019t sure she could have done without them. As her career has gone on, Hamilton said she has realized that she does not like living in Hollywood and now lives in New Orleans. However, before she permanently moved to Louisiana, Hamilton lived on a farm in Leesburg, Virginia, for a time, to be near her parents at the end of their lives. However, this part of her life wouldn\u2019t last and Hamilton said she soon felt the call of urban life, leading her to sell the farm in 2016. \u201cIt\u2019s lonely having a farm. You\u2019ve got land and you\u2019ve only got three neighbors, but I just needed something vital with a young population,\u201d she said. \u201cI wanted to see people of color around me and just have the urban really close.\u201d Though Hamilton prefers urban life, she had nothing but praise for Charlottesville, sharing that she once spent a whole summer here. \u201cI spent one crazy summer out of my life [in Charlottesville] because I was pretty sure I wanted to move there,\u201d she said. \u201cBut that was in the early days and I had to return to Hollywood.\u201d The 33rd annual Virginia Film Festival runs through Sunday and offers a virtual lineup of more than 50 feature films, documentaries, shorts and discussions, as well as in-person, socially distanced drive-in movies at Dairy Market and Morven Farm. More information and tickets can be found at virginiafilmfestival.org.","247":"RICHMOND \u2014 Though a University of Virginia model now projects a potential new peak in Virginia COVID-19 cases in November, a top state health official says it\u2019s too soon to tell whether an uptick in cases over the past few weeks is indicative of a bigger trend. \u201cIt\u2019s premature to say now things are increasing,\u201d said Dr. Lilian Peake, Virginia\u2019s state epidemiologist. \u201cWe really have had quite a bit of increase over the summer. And that\u2019s been generally going down. Now we are seeing a little bit of increase but it\u2019s small and we need to see what happens with that.\u201d A model released Oct. 16 by UVa\u2019s Biocomplexity Institute projects that confirmed COVID-19 cases will peak in Virginia during the week ending Nov. 22 with 8,394 weekly cases and a total of 202,040 confirmed cases by Thanksgiving, though the institute cautioned that the model isn\u2019t necessarily a crystal ball. (As of Saturday, there were 172,372 confirmed and probable cases in Virginia.) \u201cModels are designed to project what could happen based on current trends but do not forecast what will happen. Behavioral responses drive changes in current trends,\u201d the Oct. 16 report says. Previous reports by the institute indicated Virginia hit its weekly peak the week of Aug. 9, when there were 7,581 weekly cases. Incidence of COVID-19 in Virginia remains below the national average, Peake said, with 88 new cases per 100,000 the week of Oct. 12, compared with the national average of 117 per 100,000. The model says five Virginia health districts have entered \u201csurge trajectories\u201d (defined as 2.5 or more confirmed cases per 100,000 people per week) and the \u201creproduction rate\u201d \u2014 the number of cases expected to be generated by one case \u2014 is above 1.0 statewide and in all but one region. Bryan Lewis, a computational epidemiologist and a research professor at UVa, said the institute\u2019s latest projection also was informed by increasing transmission rates in cooler states such as Wisconsin, North Dakota and South Dakota, as well as previous research on how respiratory viruses spread, particularly when cold weather forces more people inside. \u201cWe\u2019ve been seeing increased rates up there,\u201d he said. That onset of colder weather, combined with more school divisions across Virginia resuming in-person instruction and school-related virus transmission data from other states, as well as the increased cases in college towns when universities brought students back, augurs an increase in virus cases into the late fall and early winter. \u201cWhile early, national and global trends suggest concerns about winter case growth and schools reopening may be founded,\u201d the institute wrote in its most recent update. But it\u2019s not carved in stone. Human behavior can make all the difference, both Lewis and Peake said. And after more than eight months of grappling with a pandemic virus that\u2019s infected millions of Americans and killed 223,293 people (including 3,578 in Virginia), now isn\u2019t the time to let \u201cCOVID fatigue\u201d set in, especially as Thanksgiving approaches and many people are considering how to approach large family gatherings, they said. \u201cOutbreaks are occurring when people let their guard down,\u201d Peake said, citing recent examples of workplace breakrooms and lunch rooms when masks come off and social distancing isn\u2019t observed. \u201cOne thing that we have learned is there is a lot of asymptomatic transmission.\u201d Peake said state officials are monitoring mounting case numbers in southwest, central and southern Virginia and have rapid-response teams to help curb rising transmission, similar to the approach the state took with surges in eastern Virginia over the summer. The teams combine workers focused on testing strategies, containment of outbreaks, communications and making recommendations for isolation and quarantine, she said. \u201cEach region is doing that to really look at the data and understand what can we do differently,\u201d Peake said. The prescription for Halloween and the coming holiday season is more of the same: masks, social distancing and avoiding large gatherings. \u201cIt\u2019s been hard but it has kept a lot of people well,\u201d Peake said. \u201cVirginians have done a really good job of taking this seriously and putting preventative measures in place,\u201d she added. \u201cTransmission is continuing. In some areas, it is quite high. So it\u2019s important for all Virginians to continue to take this seriously and practice preventive measures that we know are working. \u2026 There has been some good news about potential vaccines. So if we continue to take this seriously and practice safe measures, hopefully in the future we\u2019ll have a vaccine and have better treatment.\u201d From a policy standpoint, Virginia has done a good job of managing the pandemic, Lewis said. Some of the commonwealth\u2019s residents, however, don\u2019t get as high marks for their compliance, in his view. \u201cThere\u2019s guidelines, mandates, etc. \u2026 But adherence is what drives reduction of the disease,\u201d he said. Virginia, and much of the rest of the country, he noted, are entering a potential high transmission season not having knocked down prevalence of the virus enough to relax any restrictions. \u201cWe\u2019re heading into the winter with a higher number of cases than we would have preferred,\u201d he said, likening the situation to a speeding car coming to a bend in the road. \u201cWe\u2019re going into this curve a little too fast.\u201d","248":"ROANOKE \u2014 Virginia\u2019s 5th Congressional District has been full of surprises the past few years. After just one term in office, Republican Rep. Tom Garrett abruptly announced in 2018 his struggle with alcoholism and that he wouldn\u2019t run for reelection. Then, in a hastily assembled nomination contest, Denver Riggleman won the Republican nod by one vote. After a competitive race \u2014 which featured the Democratic opponent accusing Riggleman of being a fan of Bigfoot erotica \u2014 Riggleman won the seat. A few months into his term, Riggleman officiated at a same-sex marriage, offending social conservatives, and lost the party nomination a year later to self-described \u201cbright red biblical conservative\u201d Bob Good. Democrat Cameron Webb is trying to pull off the latest plot twist Nov. 3: defeat Good in a sprawling district that stretches from the North Carolina line to the outskirts of Northern Virginia that President Donald Trump won by 11 percentage points in 2016. It\u2019s tough for Democrats to win in the district, which includes much of the Charlottesville area and was drawn to favor Republicans, but Webb has mounted an aggressive campaign against Good. Webb has raised more than $4 million through the end of September, while Good has raised just under $1 million, according to federal election reports. More than $4 million in television advertising has been pumped into the race, with most of that money coming from the Webb campaign or outside groups attacking Good. The last time a Democrat won the seat was in 2008, when Tom Perriello upset incumbent Republican Virgil Goode, aided by record-high Black turnout in Charlottesville and the small rural towns in the district, as well as Barack Obama\u2019s run for president. Perriello lasted only one term after redistricting helped make the district a Republican stronghold. Webb\u2019s campaign theme is about unity, that he is a \u201cconsensus-builder.\u201d The 37-year-old internal medicine doctor and director of health policy and equity at the University of Virginia often mentions his time working as a White House fellow in the Obama and Trump administrations as one example of how he can put politics aside to work on policy. \u201cWhy is it so important to win this race?\u201d Webb said. \u201cIt\u2019s not about Democrats winning or Republicans winning. It\u2019s about the people of the 5th Congressional District winning. It\u2019s about restoring this idea that everybody here has somebody who is their advocate fighting for them in Washington D.C.\u201d Good, 54, a former Campbell County supervisor and former Liberty University athletics officials, has focused his message on the political divide. \u201cThis is an election to determine do we believe America is good or is America bad?\u201d Good said at a campaign rally. \u201cDo we want to preserve and fight for the things that have made this the greatest nation in the world and build upon those and ensure a greater future for our children and grandchildren? Or do we believe that America is an illegitimate evil nation, a racist nation that needs to be torn down and destroyed and remade in a socialist, Marxist image? That\u2019s the alternative that\u2019s being presented by the other side.\u201d When Good first challenged Riggleman for the party nod, he focused his message on hot-button issues such as banning abortion in all circumstances and limiting legal immigration. Since the convention, he\u2019s been presenting himself as a Trump backer and supporting the president\u2019s agenda. At campaign events, he says he\u2019ll defend gun rights and support Trump\u2019s energy policies. He wants to repeal the Affordable Care Act. He supports ending birthright citizenship and the process that the United States uses that prioritizes admitting immigrants with relatives living here. He says gridlock in Congress can be a good thing, and compromise is a \u201cdirty word.\u201d \u201cThe last thing we need is more government control of our health care, more government control of our lives, more government assault on our freedoms, more government assault on our values, more government assault on innocent, precious life in the womb, more government assault on our economy, on our jobs,\u201d Good said. Good supporters say they like how his conservative values are unwavering. \u201cIt\u2019s critical that people know what they are going to get from the man they are sending to Washington,\u201d said Barbara Sherman, a Bedford County resident who organized a series of rallies for women to meet Good. Good has been stressing to voters that Webb is not as moderate as people may think, calling him a \u201cradical\u201d Democrat. He has been hammering away especially hard at saying Webb, whose father worked for the Drug Enforcement Administration, will defund the police. Webb says he does not support defunding the police, and has fired back at Good by pointing out Good voted to reduce funding to the Campbell County Sheriff\u2019s Office when he was a supervisor. Television ads attacking Webb \u2014 who is Black \u2014 have featured images of New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, protesters rioting in the streets and Webb kneeling. \u201cPolitics is made worse when people drive a wedge deeper,\u201d Webb said about the attacks from Good. Good and Webb have only met once \u2014 virtually \u2014 for a forum. Campaigning during the pandemic has presented challenges. Good has been holding events, including with Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson and House Minority Whip Steve Scalise of Louisiana, where attendees weren\u2019t wearing masks. Good has made dismissive remarks in the past about the seriousness of COVID-19, which is in stark contrast to Webb, who has been treating COVID-19 patients when he\u2019s not campaigning. Webb is running on a platform of supporting a public health insurance option, addressing racial and economic inequities, criminal justice reform and expanding educational opportunities, including tuition-free community and public college for low-income people. As a doctor, Webb thinks he is well-suited to be in Congress as the country is trying to overcome the coronavirus pandemic. He wants to scale up testing capacity, supports additional stimulus payments to Americans and expanding eligibility and offerings in Medicaid and SNAP. On a recent tour of businesses in Nelson County, he heard from owners about the challenges they face in keeping people on payroll and the decline in revenue. Justin Billcheck explained the struggles in the event production industry because he can\u2019t put on concerts and festivals when people should be socially distancing. \u201cThere\u2019s no life raft coming for us,\u201d Billcheck told Webb at Devils Backbone, where he puts together music events. \u201cThere\u2019s no help coming. We\u2019re not looking for a handout. I can cope with adversity and challenges, but I need adults in leadership.\u201d \u201cThis is an election about leadership for a lot of people,\u201d Webb said. \u201cAnd no one should feel like there\u2019s no life raft coming to help them.\u201d While touring businesses in Nelson County, he stopped to visit Silverback Distillery, which the Riggleman family owns. Riggleman talked about the challenges in Congress, like when he\u2019d catch blowback when he broke from the party on issues. Riggleman also complimented Webb\u2019s campaign. \u201cYou\u2019re doing campaigning right, talking about issues and policy,\u201d Riggleman said. \u201cBut what do you do when the other person is hiding?\u201d Riggleman hasn\u2019t endorsed Good or even indicated a hint of support for him. Wounds haven\u2019t completely healed since Good defeated Riggleman in an unusual drive-thru convention. Social conservatives who hadn\u2019t come around to Riggleman, who describes himself as having a \u201cmean libertarian streak,\u201d when he became the nominee two years ago were set off when he officiated at a same-sex wedding. While many Riggleman supporters say they are reluctantly filling out the bubble on the ballot for Good, there are still some who say they intend to leave that section of the ballot blank or write in Riggleman. Signs and a billboard have popped up encouraging people to write in Riggleman\u2019s name. The division has dogged Good for much of the campaign. \u201cI\u2019ve been a Republican voter my whole life, but I\u2019ve been taught to vote for the person, not the party,\u201d said Ken Towler, who has lived in Campbell County his whole life and was a Riggleman supporter. \u201cBob Good is filled with hate and uses fear tactics, and we don\u2019t need any more of that.\u201d Towler was one of a handful of Republican voters who showed up to an event at a residence in a wooded area of Bedford County one recent Saturday to do some skeet shooting with Webb. \u201cI\u2019m very impressed with him,\u201d Towler said of Webb. \u201cI think he\u2019s a straightforward person.\u201d Towler participated with a few other Republican voters in doing a television ad for the Webb campaign. In the ad, the residents rattle off their complaints with Good while he was a supervisor: voting for a budget that reduced funding for the sheriff\u2019s office, not enough funding for K-12 schools and voting to raise ambulance fees. \u201cBob was a disaster,\u201d a woman says in the ad. Noting the division among Republicans and an impressive Democratic candidate to run in a red district, political analysts at Cook Political Report and Sabato\u2019s Crystal Ball at UVa, a politics newsletter and website, have both rated the race as a \u201cToss Up.\u201d \u201cI like a jump ball,\u201d Webb said. \u201cWhoever wants it more will get it.\u201d","249":"The novel coronavirus fueling the global pandemic can affect anyone, regardless of race or social economic background, but that doesn\u2019t mean the virus offers everyone an equal opportunity for infection, hospitalization and death. From Central Virginia to the state to the nation, non-whites are more likely to be hospitalized after contracting COVID-19 and far more likely to be seriously sickened or die from the disease, according to figures released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Virginia Department of Health, Thomas Jefferson Health District and other agencies across the country. Medical and social researchers say the rates of illness and death reflect historic inequality in income, housing and economic opportunities. That history created the current economic situation where minorities are more likely to live with multi-generational families in smaller homes. The inequality also led to a larger percentage of minorities working lower-paying, service-related jobs at hourly wages with little or no sick time and often in close quarters with other employees. University of Virginia Medical Center doctors working in COVID care units say patients are nearly equally divided between whites, Latinos and Blacks. That doesn\u2019t mean that they\u2019re being affected equally, however. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing disproportionate numbers, high numbers of African American and Latinos in our ICU and regular COVID units,\u201d said Dr. Taison Bell, a specialist in critical care and pulmonary medicine who has been working in the units since the virus struck in March. \u201cWe\u2019re kind of divided into thirds as far as cases go. About 30% are African American, 30% are Hispanic and about 33% are white,\u201d Bell said. \u201cThat may seem balanced, but it\u2019s not. African Americans don\u2019t make up 30% of the population and neither do Latinos.\u201d Bell said minorities are not only more likely to be infected \u2014 they\u2019re more likely to die from the virus. \u201cAcross the country, African Americans are dying at higher rates than any group \u2014 up to four times as much in some areas \u2014 yet they make up about 8% to 10% of the population,\u201d he said. According to the COVID Tracking Project, which gathers and tabulates statistics from each state, Hispanics were most likely to contract the virus per capita in Virginia, followed by Blacks and American Indians. Blacks were most likely to die from the disease. National figures from the project show native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders in the U.S. were the most likely per capita to contract COVID. They are followed by American Indians, Latinos and Blacks. All four groups were more than twice as likely to contract the virus as whites. Again, Blacks were the group most likely to die from the virus, the study showed. In the Thomas Jefferson Health District, Blacks comprise 35% of patients hospitalized for COVID-19 and 23.4% of deaths despite being only 13.7% of the district\u2019s population. Latinos are about 4.7% of the district population but make up 17.3% of the reported COVID cases, 14.8% of the hospitalizations and about 4% of deaths. Whites are 81% of the district population but make up 51% of COVID cases, 45.74% of hospitalization and 70.13% of deaths. In the past several months, numerous studies have indicated that the coronavirus is easily transmitted simply by being in a room with people talking, laughing, singing and shouting. Those activities create an aerosol spray of tiny viral water drops that can remain airborne for hours, the studies show. \u201cIf you spend time close together in enclosed rooms, you have more chance to absorb more of the virus \u2014 what we call the inoculum or infectious dose that it takes to get COVID,\u201d Bell said. \u201cThe farther apart you can be, the more social distanced and the less time spent in close quarters at home or at work, the less inoculum you receive, so the more mild your case.\u201d That\u2019s problematic, according to health officials. \u201cOur poor communities and our communities of color live in more crowded conditions and that increases exposure to COVID-19. It\u2019s one of the reasons for the higher case rates,\u201d said Guleer Shahab, data analyst for the Virginia Department of Health and the TJHD. \u201cThe higher hospitalization and death rates are likely influenced by social and economic disparities.\u201d Low-income workers are more likely to have less healthy diets and have chronic medical conditions such as diabetes or high blood pressure, studies show. \u201cThe more chronic health problems you have, what we call co-morbidities, the more likely to have a serious COVID case,\u201d Bell said. \u201cNow, if you look at a health standpoint, separate from the virus, the Black and brown communities have most of the comorbidities disproportionately represented; high blood pressure, diabetes, heart disease, kidney disease, obesity.\u201d Bell said COVID-19 uses a body\u2019s weaknesses and chronic conditions to create medical complications in patients. \u201cIt enters your lungs, but it goes through your whole body. You\u2019re more likely to recover if you go into it with all of your guns, all of your defenses. You\u2019re much better off with a good immune system and healthy body,\u201d Bell said. Bell said those chronic issues are directly related to diet and exercise. He noted that minority communities are less likely to have access to fresh foods and more likely to buy cheaper, more processed foods. \u201cThere is less access to grocery stores in those neighborhoods, so you are less likely to have access to healthy foods. Plus, healthy and fresh foods cost more,\u201d Bell said. \u201cYou can ask, \u2018why is that?,\u2019 and to find out, you have to go back to the era of segregation and the practice of redlining.\u201d Redlining is the name given to the practice of targeting specific neighborhoods based on the predominate race, religion or social status of its population. Neighborhoods that were redlined often were blacklisted by financial companies, retail and grocery stores and other services. \u201cSegregated neighborhoods did not see the property values rise. Parks were less often built and people were crowded into multi-family and multi-generational housing by urban renewal,\u201d Bell said. Bell said his family was affected by those exact issues. \u201cYou could own your home, but if you couldn\u2019t get financing, you couldn\u2019t improve or fix it and then buy another or sell yours. The same economic forces that would increase home values for houses in white neighborhoods didn\u2019t impact us,\u201d he said. \u201cI grew up with four generations under the same roof. That\u2019s what we had to do.\u201d Research conducted on behalf of the National Institutes of Health in September found Blacks and Latinos\/Hispanics across the country are more likely to live in densely populated areas, in multi-generational households and be essential workers. \u201cThose in essential roles are less likely to have paid leave, and not having paid leave makes it difficult to self-isolate,\u201d Shahab said. \u201cThese are not often high-paying jobs. People are less likely to get a COVID test because if it\u2019s positive, you have quarantine for 14 days, and they can\u2019t afford to go two weeks without a paycheck.\u201d That means that those who seek treatment are often further into the illness, she said. \u201cThey\u2019re more likely to be sicker and more likely to need care,\u201d Shahab said. \u201cThe disparity in care and access to care is always there, but COVID is making it clear.\u201d","250":"Charlottesville, Albemarle County and University of Virginia officials are taking steps to be more collaborative as they work to increase equity and inclusion in their respective organizations. On Wednesday, city and county elected officials and leadership from UVa met to discuss a memorandum of understanding for equity and inclusion. The memorandum commits the entities generally toward common goals, but does not delve into specific measures. Some of the goals include evaluating current programs and policies, deepening the commitment to equity and achieving \u201calignment in both priorities and strategies employed to improve regional outcomes.\u201d \u201cI think it\u2019s a great step forward,\u201d said UVa President Jim Ryan. \u201cObviously it\u2019s a start, not a finish. \u2026 Getting started on something concrete would be a great way to turn this from a memorandum of understanding into something that\u2019s actually making a difference on the ground.\u201d Charlottesville and Albemarle already have multiple MOUs on environmental issues, affordable housing, education, transportation and economic development. Charlottesville City Councilor Lloyd Snook said he appreciated that the document included a pledge to set measurable goals. \u201cWe can all feel good about ourselves, but without any actual identifiable indications of what that progress has been, we might just feel good without actually accomplishing anything,\u201d he said. Mayor Nikuyah Walker said she wanted to see some immediate collaborations that could be done, and views of people seeing a change in their lives that they want to talk about as a measure of success. \u201cIf people are not grasping on to whatever we are implementing and are able to talk about how they have been impacted, how their lives have changed, as a result of whatever we\u2019re doing, then I think we\u2019re still in a position where we can stretch ourselves a little bit more,\u201d she said. Before leaving the call, Ryan proposed an initiative to ensure all children would be able to read by third grade. Afterward, officials widely supported the idea. Snook said he is \u201cintrigued\u201d by the idea because constituents frequently bring up achievement gaps as a key equity issue. After Ryan left the call, Walker said leadership needs to be fully committed to regional collaboration. \u201cIf we are truly in this together, then we need to make sure there is a commitment for us to participate in the meetings the entire time,\u201d she said. Officials agreed each entity needs to dedicate a staff member to ensure the agreement\u2019s goals are met. Also during the meeting, Thomas Jefferson Health District Director Denise Bonds and Ryan McKay, senior policy analyst for the district, presented updated COVID-19 numbers from the area. Both Charlottesville and Albemarle approved stricter restrictions to slow the spread of the coronavirus in July. Both bodies later extended those restrictions, with the county\u2019s staying in place until Nov. 18 and the city\u2019s remaining until the end of a declaration of a local emergency. The university has implemented restrictions that will carry over into the spring semester, including face mask requirements, limits on student gatherings and regular testing. In both Charlottesville and Albemarle, the number of cases decreased over the seven days ending Oct. 19, with 45 cases and 49 cases respectively, but rose again over the seven days ending Oct. 26, with 70 cases and 78 cases. The rolling seven-day percent positivity was around 2.2% on Oct. 26 in Albemarle, while it was 2.1% in Charlottesville. McKay said the percent positivity is influenced by all of the testing that is done at UVa. McKay said the area is now seeing more cases outside of the university setting. \u201cThe university has contained and mitigated spread through reopening rooms for isolation and quarantine, and we\u2019ve seen some different settings for transmission among the community,\u201d he said. Bonds said there is a huge amount of COVID fatigue, and it has been a stressful and worrying time for many. \u201cI think with the added stress of an election that\u2019s coming up next week and the uncertainty surrounding that election, that\u2019s causing people to let down their guard, essentially,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s where I would ask all of you to really help us in educating your constituents and cheerleading them on that we need to continue to do those mitigation measures that we know work. We need to not go and have a big family Thanksgiving gathering.\u201d Both elected bodies will later vote to formally adopt the MOU. Ryan said university attorneys will review the agreement before he signs onto it. The meeting was the most recent public joint discussion of the three entities. The Planning and Coordination Council, a regional planning group organized to encourage collaboration between the city, county and UVa, dissolved itself last year and a new, staff-led initiative, the Land Use and Environmental Planning Committee was established. Albemarle Spokesperson Emily Kilroy said Wednesday\u2019s joint meeting was centered on the equity and inclusion MOU discussion and the COVID-19 update from the health district. LUEPC has not met since March, according to meeting documents posted online, and a meeting for elected officials to receive a formal presentation or update from the committee has not yet been scheduled, \u201cas the impact of the pandemic has shifted focus to regional emergency response,\u201d Kilroy said.","251":"Dr. Webb is clearly both intelligent and experienced: He has a law degree; worked for the Obama and, briefly, the Trump administrations; practices internal medicine at the University of Virginia; has cared for COVID patients, and serves as the UVa Medical Center Director of Health Policy and Equity. What impresses us most, though, is his willingness and ability to work with people from different backgrounds to find common-sense solutions. As a practicing physician, Dr. Webb uses these qualities daily in caring for his patients. This commitment to work on behalf of others to achieve shared goals is what our country needs at this divisive time. With the polls now open, please join us in voting for Dr. Cameron Webb. Jocelyn Schauer Ashley Schauer Albemarle County","252":"Technology both new and old drove the success of this year\u2019s pandemic-disrupted Virginia Film Festival as organizers embraced the new virtual reality of movies and went back to the future with a return to drive-in shows. The film festival wrapped its 33rd year on Sunday with a sold-out, drive-in screening of director Chlo\u00e9 Zhao\u2019s film festival audience award-winner, \u201cNomadland.\u201d The festival sponsored more than 170 films and events from Oct. 21 to Oct. 25, highlighted by 10 drive-in screenings that drew occupants of more than 680 vehicles to view movies on the sides of Dairy Market in Charlottesville and Morven Farm in Albemarle County. More than 11,000 streams of virtual movies and recorded programs were counted, as well. Festival organizers said they believe the event was a success and credited staff with adapting to the new reality of COVID-19. \u201cI\u2019m really proud of the team and how they responded, especially considering how many programs across the country had to cancel their events,\u201d said festival director Jody Kielbasa, who also serves as University of Virginia vice provost for the arts. \u201cWe looked at the options in the summer and decided to adapt as much of the programs as we could. We believed that now, perhaps more than ever, the community needs the distraction and level of engagement that films and the festival itself offer.\u201d The festival\u2019s virtual program, hosted on the Eventive platform, offered more than 60 narrative and documentary features, 67 short films, 43 tributes and conversations and a dedicated school screening event attended by local and regional students. The festival offered 164 guests in person and virtually, including actor, writer, producer and director Ethan Hawke. Author James McBride, actor Annette Bening, Turner Classic Movies host Ben Mankiewicz, actor Leslie Odom Jr. and actor Linda Hamilton were joined by UVa President Jim Ryan and producer and UVa grad Julie Lynn in conversations. Leading film composer and multiple Oscar nominee Thomas Newman talked with Charlottesville Symphony Music Director Ben Rous about Newman\u2019s work on such films as \u201c1917,\u201d \u201cAmerican Beauty,\u201d \u201cIn the Bedroom,\u201d \u201cThe Green Mile\u201d and more. Most of the discussion and conversations featured in the program are available on the festival\u2019s YouTube Channel, www.youtube.com\/user\/VirginiaFilmFestival. Festival audiences voted for their favorites, naming \u201cNomadland\u201d as best narrative feature; \u201cThey Ain\u2019t Ready for Me\u201d as best documentary; \u201cWe Got This\u201d as best narrative short film; and \u201cThe First\u201d as best documentary short film. For the first time this year, the Virginia Film Festival partnered with Reel South to present the Reel South SHORT Award. The award honors outstanding achievement in Southern documentary short-form at film festivals across the South. This year\u2019s winner was \u201cLipstick and Leather,\u201d directed by Amy Oden, which explores the alt-drag community in Washington, D.C., and how these performers are spreading their influence across the East Coast. Kielbasa said he hopes the festival will return to indoor traditional venues such as the Paramount Theater next year, but he said much depends on the pandemic. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to figure out what the future holds for us,\u201d he said. \u201cWe long to do what we traditionally do, but we need to keep our community safe.\u201d The pandemic has hit Hollywood movie makers and movie theaters hard, with several theater corporations, including Regal, shutting down venues as the virus has surged. Kielbasa said that could create change in the industry in the short run, but he believes theater attendance eventually will bounce back. \u201cI think people miss going to the movie theater, that whole experience of laughing together and enjoying a film as an audience,\u201d he said. \u201cI think there will be a mad rush to return to the movies once we are able to, whenever that is.\u201d","253":"A patient who transferred into a unit at the University of Virginia Medical Center late last week from another facility has tested positive for the COVID-19 virus, forcing some staff members to quarantine, according to hospital officials. The patient was in a private room and did not have direct contact with other patients. Officials said they are tracing the patient\u2019s contacts to advise them of the positive test. The patient\u2019s name was not released and other information is being withheld due to medical privacy laws. \u201cThe patient came into the hospital without any symptoms and, after being here for several days, developed symptoms and tested positive,\u201d said Dr. Reid Adams, an oncology surgeon and associate director of clinical affairs for the hospital\u2019s cancer center. \u201cWe performed contract tracing and we had to ask some people go into quarantine.\u201d The patient developed symptoms early this week, officials said. Several staff members have tested negative for the virus after the exposure while others have yet to be tested but are in quarantine. It takes four to seven days after exposure before a test can accurately determine if someone has contracted COVID-19. So far no staff members have developed symptoms of the virus. \u201cA test now doesn\u2019t mean that four days from now symptoms won\u2019t develop,\u201d said Dr. Costi Sifri, director of hospital epidemiology at UVa. \u201cGoing into quarantine is important because what happened on Monday doesn\u2019t reflect what the test will show four days later.\u201d Medical Center officials screen patients prior to admission to determine if they are exhibiting COVID-19 symptoms or may have been in contact with someone with virus. UVa often receives patients who transfer from other hospitals and those patients go through similar screening, but do not necessarily receive a test prior to admission. \u201cWe identify patients who have symptoms or risk factors and that ends up a being a pretty liberal testing protocol. We test many of them, but we don\u2019t test everybody,\u201d said Sifri. Staff, visitors and patients are required to wear masks when possible and maintain social distancing. Sifri noted that nurses, doctors and other caregivers cannot always maintain proper social distance when taking care of patients. \u201cWe emphasize the approach that anybody we\u2019re seeing could have COVID and that at any time we ourselves could have COVID and act accordingly,\u201d he said. UVa has set up separate units to treat patients with COVID at the hospital, including separate intensive care units. The units are physically distant to help prevent patients who are in the facility for other medical procedures from contracting the virus. The hospital also restricts visitors to all units to decrease the chances of community transmission of the virus. \u201cWe continue to have restrictions in place and the reason is people could be asymptomatic and be vectors for transmission,\u201d Adams said. \u201cWe try to limit exposure as much as possible.\u201d","254":"University of Virginia health and medical officials say their months-long effort to take COVID-19 testing into communities lacking access will continue throughout the winter, even as classes end and students leave for home. Since the testing began in August, an estimated 3,500 tests have been administered to non-university community members. The testing locations focus on minorities and lower income essential workers who traditionally have less access to medical care. The community events are separate from the university\u2019s testing protocol for staff and faculty. \u201cThese events are specifically for the community. Students are not allowed to participate because they have a testing program already set up specifically for them,\u201d said Dr. Mohan Nadkarni, chief of UVa\u2019s general medicine department and the lead for the community testing program. \u201cWe\u2019re focusing on communities that often don\u2019t have access to health care and are working jobs that don\u2019t provide paid time off,\u201d he said. \u201cWe also provide information about organizations in the community that can provide free food or help with bills, if needed.\u201d The UVa program is in tandem with one set up by the Thomas Jefferson Health District to provide testing for rural communities. Both testing programs will continue through the winter. \u201cWe are definitely going to be here and, in fact, are increasing our testing after Thanksgiving and leading to the holidays as people spend more time together indoors,\u201d said Kathryn Goodman, district spokeswoman. \u201cWe had nine testing events in October and we\u2019re planning for 14 in November.\u201d \u201cI think we need to keep the testing going until a vaccine comes and is widely distributed,\u201d said Dr. Craig Kent, executive vice president for health affairs at the university. \u201cWe\u2019re far from done with this virus.\u201d UVa currently tests on Mondays at the Church of the Incarnation Catholic Church in Albemarle County and on Tuesdays at Mount Zion First African Baptist Church in Charlottesville. University volunteers also conduct tests on Wednesdays and Thursdays at various locations. The health department focuses on providing tests in rural areas of Albemarle County and in Louisa, Greene, Fluvanna and Nelson counties. Locations and dates for upcoming events can be found on the Thomas Jefferson Health District website. Both organizations provide drive-through testing, including registration of those being tested, which allows medical personnel to contact those tested to give them results. Both also provide information on where to find food, financial assistance and other programs available to them as well as information on isolating and quarantine. About 100 tests are usually performed at the events and test results are usually returned in 48 to 72 hours. Goodman said splitting the area between the agencies allows more people to access the tests. \u201cWe want to go to the rural areas so those people don\u2019t need to drive an hour or so into the city to get a test,\u201d she said. \u201cWe look at our data to see if there are areas that need testing and we go to areas that don\u2019t have tests readily available.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s really been a great partnership with the health district,\u201d said Kent. \u201cWe have similar missions and they have focused on doing the testing outside of Charlottesville and we focus on testing inside Charlottesville.\u201d Nadkarni said supplies of tests have improved since earlier this spring and summer and that the specific tests being used take about two three days for results to return. There are very few false readings in the test, he said. Those about to travel or who serve as caregivers to others in homes, also take advantage of the testing events, Nadkarni said. \u201cThese are among the most accurate tests available,\u201d he said. \u201cWe try to focus getting the tests for those who are symptomatic or may have been in contact with COVID patients as well as those at high-risk. Those are people with chronic illnesses like diabetes. We highly recommend people who are immunosuppressed get the tests.\u201d COVID tests have become more available to the public with some urgent care centers, drug stores and primary care physician offices offering them. They are usually reserved for those with possible symptoms, exposure or at high-risk. The tests cost in the neighborhood of $125, depending on who is administering the test, whether it\u2019s covered by insurance and from where it is purchased. \u201cThat\u2019s not a lot of money for many people but for a lot of people, that\u2019s a prohibitive cost,\u201d Nadkarni said. \u201cThat could be the difference between buying food or paying rent and getting a test.\u201d Kent said that testing has been controversial across the country, especially as early efforts proved ineffective and assumptions about the virus turned out to be incorrect. \u201cIn the beginning, we didn\u2019t really understand the virus at all and there was little information available to us so the medical community had to make assumptions,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve learned a lot since then and we\u2019ve really learned that we need to do a lot of testing. We should test as many people as possible.\u201d Those who test positive for COVID are advised on how to self-isolate and where to get treatment as well as financial support, if needed. \u201cIt\u2019s important because the more testing we do, the more we\u2019re likely to find COVID cases and the more cases we find, the more we can get them to isolate and prevent other cases,\u201d Kent said. \u201cIt\u2019s one way to stop the disease.\u201d Officials said anyone with COVID-like symptoms should be tested. Those who work around a lot of other people on a regular basis and anyone who has been near someone testing positive should get a test. \u201cIt\u2019s hard sometimes because the first symptoms are so much like the flu or colds,\u201d Goodman said. \u201cIf you haven\u2019t seen anyone for a month and you don\u2019t go out very often and work at home and suddenly you get symptoms, you have to consider whether it\u2019s allergies. The same symptoms for someone working everyday around others could mean something else.\u201d Kent said UVa and the health district are concerned with public health and safety and that\u2019s the reason for taking the tests to the streets. \u201cPeople are worried. They\u2019re worried about their safety and the safety of others and our interests are in their safety,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to meet the demand and, if the demand increases, we\u2019ll increase our efforts.\u201d","255":"When you care to send the best, send music. From murder hornets and killer caterpillars to so many hurricanes that they\u2019re named after Greek letters, the self-isolation and quarantine-filled pandemic year of 2020 has been tough on everyone. That may be where University of Virginia musical care packages come in. The brainchild of President Jim Ryan and staff, the care packages are like those greeting cards that play snippets of favorite tunes. The difference is the packages provide the whole tune in tune and are recorded by real musicians. The packages are created and delivered by University Records, a UVa organization made up of staff, students and community members. They are delivered for a small fee that is split between University Records and the Charlottesville Emergency Relief Fund for Artists, which helps to pay bills for musicians and artists in the community left financially stranded by COVID-related venue and gig closures. \u201cPresident Ryan is a big proponent of the arts, and he feels that they\u2019re a way to bring people together. The pandemic has made performing difficult for musicians and just as difficult for audiences,\u201d said harmonica player Matt Weber, senior special assistant. The packages include recordings sent via internet or in-person performances in public settings on Grounds at a distance of 10 feet or more and with face masks. UVa\u2019s COVID-19 rules prohibit students from entering others\u2019 dorm buildings or private residences. \u201cThey\u2019re kind of like singing telegrams,\u201d Weber said. \u201cIt\u2019s a way to create moments of joy and being able to connect.\u201d Weber said Ryan\u2019s support for the arts led to the president hosting the Arts on the Hill program this fall that brings musicians and artists to Carr\u2019s Hill for virtual performances. That led to the care package idea. \u201cYou have all these people who love to perform but who can\u2019t and people who want to enjoy the performances but can\u2019t,\u201d Weber said. \u201cThere is a need to bring performance into people\u2019s homes and a need for artists to perform. What we needed was a place to bring the performers and the audience together.\u201d The idea quickly led the president and staff to contact University Records, a sanctioned group of musicians, vocalists, rappers, songwriters, producers and graphic artists who support each other and create music. \u201cWe had the idea and then the question was how do we put this together?\u201d Weber recalled. \u201cThe first thought we had was call Veronica. We bet she\u2019d know.\u201d That would be Veronica Merril, a guitarist, singer and fourth-year student majoring in architectural history and music. She was the creative force behind parts of UVa\u2019s virtual graduation ceremony last spring. \u201cMatt contacted me because we have a precedent of working together and we have 300 musicians working with us,\u201d Merril said. \u201cOur club is comprised of people from all years, all majors, graduate students, staff, people from the community \u2014 anyone who loves to play.\u201d Picking a package is easy. First, determine what you want to send, say perhaps \u201cEscape (The Pina Colada Song).\u201d Go to the organization\u2019s website at musiccarepackage.com and click on the order tab and follow the directions. The request will be put on a list and participating musicians will record the song and send it out via the internet, or play it on Grounds. \u201cWe have a bunch of different musicians who play different instruments and in different styles,\u201d Merril said. \u201cI\u2019m sure there are some things we probably can\u2019t do, but I think we have some talented people who can play just about anything.\u201d A virtual music care package runs $10. An in-person package costs $30. The money is split equally between University Records and the Charlottesville Emergency Relief Fund for Artists. Sponsored by New City Arts and The Bridge Progressive Arts Initiative, the fund had provided more than $48,000 to 167 area artists as of Sept. 10. The artists live in Charlottesville or Albemarle, Fluvanna, Greene, Louisa, or Nelson counties. \u201cWe know the entire community is hurting during [the pandemic] and especially the artist community, and we wanted to do something for those who can no longer make their living,\u201d Merril said. \u201cThe fund has done a lot to help artists in the area.\u201d The care packages are beginning to take off. One of the first was sent to Ryan, himself. \u201cI played \u2018Thunder Road\u2019 by Bruce Springsteen for him,\u201d Merril said. \u201cI changed the words to \u2018Rugby Road\u2019 and made it a bit of a spoof.\u201d Ryan said he hopes the care packages can keep musicians, artists and their audiences connected during COVID-19. \u201cWhile they may not look the same as they did eight months ago, I believe the arts remain an essential part of our human experience,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cThese musical care packages are creatively connecting our community and spreading some joy, both of which are especially needed in this time of distance and uncertainty. Many thanks to all the students who are sharing their gifts and talents through this initiative.\u201d","256":"As an unprecedented Election Day arrives, most registered voters in Albemarle County and Charlottesville already have cast their ballots. An estimated 60% of registered voters in the county and 52% in the city either have voted early in person or sent their ballots in via the mail, according to election officials. Traditionally, both localities have seen a turnout of between 75% and 80% of registered voters in presidential election years. The high rate of early voting likely will lead to shorter lines Tuesday, said Lauren Eddy, deputy registrar for Albemarle. All polling locations in the county are prepared for social distancing and are taking various precautions to prevent the spread of COVID-19, she said. Though the county anticipates a smooth day, Eddy urged voters to be mannerly with poll workers, many of whom are working a presidential election for the first time. \u201cMany of our poll workers from previous years fall into high-risk categories and so we\u2019ve gotten a lot of new volunteers and workers,\u201d she said. \u201cPlease be kind and patient with these new workers.\u201d COVID-19 protections will be in place, all county election workers will be wearing face masks and surfaces will be disinfected on a regular basis, she said. Similarly, Charlottesville election officials are anticipating a smaller Election Day turnout than usual, due to all the early voting. Jim Nix, of the city registrar\u2019s office, said the city is expecting as many as 12,000 voters Tuesday, which is significantly less than usually seen. Voters should wear masks and bring their own black or blue pens, he said. Though both masks and pens will be provided for those without, Nix said coming prepared will help the process go more smoothly. Some minor delays may occur as poll workers disinfect surfaces, Nix said. Election officials from both localities said they are not expecting any security concerns but police officials and commonwealth\u2019s attorneys for the localities have met with election officials to discuss safety plans. A joint news release from the Charlottesville and Albemarle County chiefs of police and commonwealth\u2019s attorneys said that though an orderly and peaceful Election Day is anticipated, their organizations and offices are committed to investigating and prosecuting any violation of the law that involves the intimidation or harassment of citizens seeking to vote. Voting basics All polling locations in Virginia will be open from 6 a.m. to 7 p.m. Tuesday. Two polling locations in Albemarle County have changed this year: Voters in the Branchlands Precinct will cast ballots at the Hillsdale Conference Center, 550 Hillsdale Drive; and voters in the Northside Precinct will go to Laurel Hill Baptist Church, 3959 Grand Forks Blvd. Voter in the city and county may opt to vote outside through curbside voting if they wish to avoid going inside the building, according to news releases from the localities. There will be ballot drop boxes at or near the door of all city and county polling places for voters who wish to bring completed mail-in ballots to a polling location Tuesday. Ballots must be inside the secrecy envelope provided with the ballot, and the statement on the envelope \u2014 including the voter\u2019s registration address and signature \u2014 must be completed. Signature of a witness is not required. Mailed ballots must be postmarked no later than Tuesday and received by the correct registrar\u2019s office no later than noon Friday. Any voter who has applied for and received a mail-in ballot but who has decided to vote in person may do so. However, they must bring their mail-in ballot with them when they vote in person so it can be exchanged for a fresh ballot. Voters who applied for a mail-in ballot but either didn\u2019t receive one, lost it or mailed it but are concerned it may not be received in time to be counted may vote via a provisional ballot. A provisional ballot will be counted once the respective registrar\u2019s office has determined that it has not received a mailed ballot from the voter by the deadline. Tuesday\u2019s weather is anticipated to be sunny with a high of 63 degrees, according to the National Weather Service. What\u2019s on the ballot? In addition to the presidential elections between Republican Donald Trump, Democrat Joe Biden and Libertarian Jo Jorgensen, voters in Charlottesville and the counties of Albemarle, Buckingham, Fluvanna, Greene, Madison and Nelson will make their voices heard in Virginia\u2019s 5th Congressional District race between Democrat Cameron Webb and Republican Bob Good. Webb, a doctor, assistant professor of medicine and director of health policy and equity at the University of Virginia, has campaigned on issues related to expanding access to high-quality affordable health care, COVID-19 economic recovery and racial equity. Webb also has highlighted his bipartisan experiences working as part of both the Trump and Barack Obama administrations. Good, a former Liberty University athletics official who also served on the Campbell County Board of Supervisors, has described himself as a \u201cbright-red biblical conservative,\u201d and snagged the Republican nomination from Rep. Denver Riggleman in June during a drive-thru convention. Good has highlighted his religious convictions, belief in small government and opposition to abortion. The 5th District race, which tends to skew Republican, has seen its rating from UVa\u2019s Center for Politics change over the past few months. As of Monday, the race was rated as leaning Republican, a change from previously being listed as a toss-up. In the 7th Congressional District, incumbent Democratic Rep. Abigail Spanberger will face off against Republican Nick Freitas. The district includes Louisa and Orange counties. Spanberger, a former CIA operations officer, ousted incumbent Republican Dave Brat in 2018, flipping the oft-red district. Freitas won re-election to the Virginia House of Delegates last year through a successful write-in campaign after failing to file paperwork on time. The election is considered one of the most competitive in the nation, though the Center for Politics has rated the district as \u201cleans-Democrat.\u201d In a statewide election, incumbent Democratic Sen. Mark R. Warner is running against Republican Daniel Gade. Warner, a former Virginia governor who is seeking his third Senate term, largely has run on his experience and his plan for COVID-19 economic recovery. Gade, an Army veteran who teaches at American University in Washington, D.C., secured the Republican nomination earlier this year during the only statewide primary. Gade has claimed that voters do not want a \u201ccareer\u201d politician and has pledged to be nonpartisan. Referendums for two amendments to the Virginia Constitution are also on the ballot this year. Amendment 1 seeks to establish a redistricting commission consisting of eight members of the General Assembly and eight citizens of the commonwealth that would be responsible for drawing the congressional and state legislative districts for the General Assembly. Amendment 2 seeks to allow disabled veterans on total disability to own a vehicle that is totally free from state and local taxation.","257":"Some legislators were perturbed late last month that several of the state\u2019s public colleges and universities continue to charge higher tuition \u2014 even though, critics say, disruption of classes has degraded the quality, and therefore the value, of that education. The University of Virginia Board of Visitors last year voted to raise tuition by 3.6% for the current 2020-21 school year. But before 2020 was far advanced, the danger posed by COVID-19 necessitated abandoning in-person classes and switching to online instruction.  When the current school year commenced, UVa migrated to a mix of online and in-person classes. Many Virginia schools are following a similar route. But lawmakers have heard complaints that online learning isn\u2019t as effective as in-person classes \u2014 and in-person classes were what students expected when they enrolled. State Sen. Chap Petersen told the Senate Finance and Appropriations Committee last month that if schools can\u2019t provide the same quality of education, they don\u2019t deserve the same level of state funding. That\u2019s a pithy soundbite, but it\u2019s not necessarily the basis for a sound financial strategy. Lawmakers need to know why tuition is going up \u2014 and it has little to with COVID. Note that UVa announced its 2020-21 tuition hike in December 2019, when COVID was just a blip on the screen, seemingly confined to faraway China. The lawmakers\u2019 argument is that quality of instruction has declined because of COVID, so the pandemic is relevant in that regard. But colleges and universities have some fixed costs that must continue, such as salaries for tenured faculty or debt payments for construction projects, regardless of whether the coronavirus is or is not damaging the quality of education. And while some current costs might have been reduced by the pandemic, others might have increased. Are schools reaping any cost savings by keeping some buildings closed? Are they spending more in medical and health-related costs, such as UVa\u2019s testing of wastewater to find evidence of the virus? In any case, the issue of tuition increases and quality of the education product is not new; it has plagued Virginia long before the pandemic and will continue to do so long afterward, unless lawmakers and educators together can find a solution. Nor is it just a state problem: Nationwide, the cost of higher education is up a whopping 25% over the past 10 years. In Virginia, a perennial argument has been that the General Assembly has reduced its share of public funding for the commonwealth\u2019s public colleges and universities \u2014 so those institutions have had little choice but to make up the difference by charging higher fees and tuitions. A 2017 study by the State Council of Higher Education for Virginia found that it would take an infusion of $660 million in state funding to restore an optimal balance between college tuition and state support. Virginia already had set a goal for that balance: The state would pay 67% of the cost of higher education. But by 2017, the state was providing only 47%. Some critics of higher education funding have argued that the state\u2019s share is falling only because colleges are irresponsibly driving up costs through unnecessary administrative expansions and other expenditures: If colleges and universities kept expenses down as they should, the state share of such costs would remain in balance. The fact is, we don\u2019t have clear answers on these and other questions. We need those answers before lawmakers can reasonably begin talking about who should pay for what \u2014 or who\u2019s at fault for any imbalances.","258":"Even with pandemic restrictions separating voters and voting booths, Central Virginians kept calm and polite as they lined up Tuesday to cast their ballots. The day ran smoothly at Charlottesville and Albemarle polling locations with shorter lines due to strong voter turnout during early voting. Although the exact numbers weren\u2019t available Tuesday night, the number of voters casting ballots either Tuesday or during the early voter period appeared to top the 2016 election. Election officials expect final vote results later this week in order to allow time to count ballots left in drop boxes and mailed and postmarked by Tuesday. Concerns of possible voter intimidation at polls appeared to be unwarranted, although there were reports of a couple of vehicles driving near Albemarle polling places honking horns and waving a candidate\u2019s banner. Charlottesville Registrar Melissa Morton said the city will scan the thousands of mail-in ballots received but will not report the numbers until Friday to allow counting of mail-in ballots sent Tuesday and received by noon Friday. About half of Charlottesville\u2019s registered voters cast their ballots during the early voting period. Albemarle Registrar Jake Washburne said the county would send a preliminary report of received absentee ballots to the state late Tuesday night. By 4 p.m., 5,491 voters cast their ballots in person, according to data from the city. Before Tuesday, 10,394 city voters cast an early ballot in person. The city had received 7,375 votes by mail as of Tuesday for a total of 17,769. The city has 34,955 registered voters. In 2016, 77% of registered Charlottesville voters participated in the election. As of 4 p.m., 18,635 voters in Albemarle County had cast ballots, about 22.8% of voters. That\u2019s on top of 41,418 total voters who took advantage of the early vote option. There are 81,683 registered voters in the county. In 2016, turnout in Albemarle was 74%. Election officials have spent months preparing to hold the election amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Voters on Tuesday were asked to follow several new precautions, including wearing a mask and staying six feet apart. Election workers were seated behind Plexiglas barriers and had plenty of hand sanitizer and disinfectant wipes to go around. Charlottesville The line of voters snaked around Clark Elementary late Tuesday morning. To pass the time, some read while others played hopscotch. Volunteers were handing out water bottles and snacks. Earlier on Tuesday, voters and poll workers were treated to live music. Linda Hanson, chief of the Clark precinct, said the line was longer than usual because of social distancing in the physical line and moved slower because they allowed fewer people into the school at a time. \u201cWe\u2019ve been really busy,\u201d Hanson said. \u201cEvery one of the voters has been patient.\u201d Hanson said she was grateful for the voters\u2019 good spirits. \u201cPeople could be cranky,\u201d she said. At her old elementary school, Mila Cesaretti voted in her first presidential election with her mother, Christina Ball \u201cIt felt good, especially for this election,\u201d she said after waiting for 50 minutes to cast her ballot. \u201cI\u2019ve been waiting for this day.\u201d They considered voting early but glad they waited \u201cto see democracy in action,\u201d Ball said. In the 20 years or so that Ball has voted at Clark, she said Tuesday was the first time she saw a line outside the building. \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing to participate in the process,\u201d she said. Both said they felt safe voting in person despite the pandemic, as mask wearing and other precautions have become second nature. At Tonsler Recreation Center in Charlottesville, precinct chief Stephen Haske didn\u2019t expect the polling location to be busy, as half of the precinct had voted already. A group of voters were lined up at 6 a.m. to start the day, though. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a steady trickle,\u201d said Haske, who is leading a precinct for the first time. Election officials helped some people vote from their cars and manned the ballot drop-off box. Haske said many of those working at Tonsler are new and younger. \u201cWe\u2019re normally an older crowd,\u201d he said, adding that everybody had good energy at attitudes after the first several hours of the day. \u201cThey\u2019re excited about the process of voting.\u201d Outside the recreation center, the Rev. Alvin Edwards and deacon Don Gathers were on hand to help bring calm to those voting. Their presence was part of an effort by the Charlottesville Clergy Collective to provide a pastoral presence at various city and county voting sites. \u201cWe\u2019re not serving as poll watchers or to engage with agitators,\u201d Edwards said. \u201cWe\u2019re not here to assist the police. We are here to bring a calm presence, and we want to help folks stay calm because you know with all the hype, we just thought it might be something else. The clergy collective, as pastors and ministers and deacons in this community, we believe we have a role as leadership in terms of providing an example of proper behavior.\u201d Gathers and Edwards voted early. Six teams of clergy members rotated throughout the precincts during the day. By the afternoon, Edwards hadn\u2019t heard of any issues. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason to get up in the air about this election,\u201d Gathers said. \u201cYou exercise your rights as a citizen of the United States to vote your preference. We want everybody to feel calm and relaxed, and that they don\u2019t feel threatened.\u201d Albemarle At Brownsville Elementary School in Crozet, Allen Freeman of the Albemarle Democrats said the day was \u201cslow; really, really slow.\u201d At least in the Brownsville precinct, it appears voters chose to send in their ballots by mail. County election workers said only one person had used the secure drop box as of about 2:30 p.m. Voters were greeted with fewer campaign workers than usual and were offered a pen before entering the school, rather than using one in the polling place. Ty Chambers, precinct chief at Brownsville, said about 50% of the precinct\u2019s voters cast a ballot early and about half of the remaining voters already had come through. Voters were only greeted with a line once \u2014 when polls opened at 6 a.m. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely been dramatically slow compared to a normal presidential election,\u201d Chambers said. Chambers said the day was going \u201cvery smooth,\u201d with no issues inside or outside of the polling place and voters coming in spurts. At Crozet Elementary School, voters were trickling in through the afternoon. An election worker said fewer than 10 people had put their ballot in the drop box, opting instead to just vote in person. The quiet afternoon at the school was only broken occasionally as vehicles with flags supporting President Donald Trump drove by and honked at the party volunteers. At Albemarle High School, volunteers said the day\u2019s turnout was slow but expected. For first-time voter Raylaja Waller, not having to wait was more encouraging for her and made the whole process more accessible. \u201cIt was a quick and speedy process,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t feel pressure to vote.\u201d She thought voting would be on computers, so she was glad to see the paper ballots. \u201cI\u2019m old-fashioned,\u201d she said. UVa On Monday, University of Virginia President Jim Ryan exhorted students and staff to vote, reminded them that the election\u2019s outcome might not be known for days or weeks and encouraged them to follow pandemic safety protocols if protesting or demonstrating. \u201cThe diversity of ideas and perspectives people bring to UVa is one of our greatest strengths. I have no doubt that those ideas and perspectives will be shared vigorously in the coming weeks, as they should be,\u201d Ryan wrote. \u201cWe will all be better off if we approach those conversations as opportunities to learn from each other and resist the urge to diminish or demean people with whom we disagree.\u201d Ryan said the unique issues surrounding this election could lead to demonstrations or protests and recognized students\u2019 rights to participate, but advised them to follow COVID-19 precautions. \u201cNo matter the outcome, it is possible that members of our community will exercise their constitutional rights to free assembly and expression through peaceful protest or demonstration. If this occurs and you choose to participate, please remember to wear a mask and maintain physical distancing,\u201d he wrote.","259":"University of Virginia students living on and off Grounds will get a final COVID-19 test before they leave school to return home for the holidays and those who test positive will be asked to quarantine before leaving, officials announced Thursday. Faculty, staff and employees will be given a chance to use a free self-test kit to check their condition prior to the holiday break. \u201cWe are on track to end the fall semester in a good position related to COVID-19. This could change quickly, as we have seen with recent trends nationally,\u201d Provost Liz Magill, Chief Operating Officer J.J. Davis and Department of Medicine Chairman Dr. Mitch Rosner said in a Thursday morning message to the UVa community. \u201cWe strongly believe that robust pre-departure testing is a key to keeping us on the right track and helping make the Thanksgiving break as safe as possible for our university community, our neighbors, and our families,\u201d they wrote. According to the message, students living in on-Grounds dormitories will have their departure tests through the university\u2019s ongoing and mandatory asymptomatic prevalence testing, which will continue through Nov. 20. The number of saliva tests available for students has increased, allowing the university to also test students living in the community as well as those on Grounds. Information and appointments will be sent out early next week, officials said. UVa health officials will also offer students additional tests prior to traveling at no cost to the student. According to the message, full-time, benefits-eligible faculty and staff, including those working in the Schools of Medicine and Nursing, as well as non-employee postdoctoral fellows may order a free self-test kit from Let\u2019s Get Checked. The kit will be shipped directly to them. Part-time salary, wage and contract workers may request a free test kit by emailing university officials at returntogrounds@virginia.edu. UVa Health employees received detailed information in an email from medical center and medical school officials regarding testing appointments. Officials said they want students to remain in their home communities as much as possible and limit travel until the start of spring semester, which will run from Feb. 1 to May 6 without the traditional spring break. \u201cIn an effort to minimize travel and possible transmission of the virus, we are asking students to return to their home communities until the start of the spring semester,\u201d the message states. \u201cLocal health officials might have additional guidance or requirements for those returning and we encourage you to look into those potential requirements before departing Charlottesville.\u201d The administrators said students living in dorms who test positive will have access to existing UVa quarantine and isolation rooms. Those who live off Grounds should make plans for a place to quarantine, should their tests be positive. \u201cIf you test positive for COVID-19 before you leave the Charlottesville-Albemarle area, you will need to follow our existing protocols on isolation and quarantine and participate in contact tracing efforts,\u201d the administrators said. \u201cWe encourage all students to have a plan for where they would isolate or quarantine if that becomes necessary over the break.\u201d Testing negative for COVID-19 may be a good thing, but it\u2019s not a promise of not being positive, administrators warned. \u201cA negative test does not completely exclude the possibility of COVID-19. You can be exposed during travel or may have been exposed just prior to departure and in both cases the test would be negative,\u201d the message states. \u201cWe recommend caution and monitoring yourself for symptoms. We also urge special caution for students returning home to a family member who is immune-compromised. If you develop any symptoms, we recommend testing for COVID-19 in your locality and isolation while awaiting the test result.\u201d Between Oct. 25 and Oct. 31, 12 UVa students out of 4,941 tested were positive for COVID-19, according to the UVa COVID-Tracker. That\u2019s a positivity rate of less than 1%. Staff and employees had a positive test percentage of 2.5% as 13 of 507 tests came back positive. The Thomas Jefferson Health District, which covers the city of Charlottesville and counties of Albemarle, Nelson, Louisa, Fluvanna and Greene, had 1.9% of tests come back positive in the past week, its records show.","260":"With help from their rivals, even the pandemic won\u2019t stop them. In solemn silence, nearly a hundred University of Virginia Reserve Officer Training Corps members on Monday will start their 24-hour vigil in ritual remembrance of soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines who never returned. The ceremony, honoring the killed, missing in action and prisoners of war, will end with a traditional three-volley rifle salute, referred to colloquially as a 21-gun salute. This year the salute will be performed by Virginia Tech ROTC\u2019s Gregory Guard honor guard team, which agreed to help after the pandemic forced the scheduled honor guard to cancel. \u201cIf that\u2019s not proof of cats and dogs living together, I don\u2019t know what is,\u201d laughed USAF Col. Michael S. Hough, commander Air Force ROTC Detachment 890, which includes cadets at James Madison University and Liberty University. \u201cIn this COVID era, the virus makes some things challenging and the salute is among those,\u201d Hough said. \u201cOriginally, we were going to have the Air Force Honor Guard in attendance to perform the salute, but they cancelled because some of their members tested positive for COVID. I reached out to Virginia Tech\u2019s program and they said they\u2019d do it.\u201d Beginning on Monday at 3:30 p.m., cadets from Detachment 890 will join with UVa\u2019s U.S. Army ROTC cadets and U.S. Navy ROTC midshipmen in the ritual near Cabell Hall. Alternating two at a time every 15 minutes, they will walk rite at UVa\u2019s McIntire Amphitheater until 3:30 p.m. on Tuesday, ending the ceremony with an address from retired USAF Lt. Gen. Tad J. Oelstrom and the honor guard\u2019s volley. The traditional rifle salute involves seven rifles firing three volleys in unison. The long guns are loaded with blanks, cartridges with powder but no projectile, and are loud, but safe. Although the rifles will not fire live ammunition, they are functional weapons and as such must be properly stored and securely locked, Hough said. Because UVa does not have the proper facilities to store and train with the weapons, its cadets cannot perform the salute themselves. Virginia Tech\u2019s long-established ROTC corps of cadets has the facilities, however. \u201cI had reached out to the Gregory Guard before we heard from the Air Force Honor Guard that they would be able to come. That\u2019s a pretty big deal, but we kept in touch with Virginia Tech, just in case,\u201d Hough said. \u201cLuckily, the corps at Tech was willing to fill in at the last minute.\u201d The ceremonies are not usually controversial but last year a decision by UVa officials to nix the rifle volley was met with widespread community outcry from veterans. Originally, university officials cancelled the volley due to concerns about the sounds of gunshots on Grounds and the impact they could have on students worried about gun violence. Officials later decided to reinstate the salute after area veterans and alumni who served in combat explained the meaning and imagery. Last year, retired Marine Col. James T. O\u2019Kelley Jr., of American Legion Post 74, a decorated veteran who led Marines at Ca Lu during intense fighting in the Vietnam War\u2019s 1968 Tet Offensive five miles southeast of Khe Sahn, said the volley reminds him of those he lost. \u201cIt brings things together. It\u2019s the past and it\u2019s the present. It\u2019s about honor and respect,\u201d he said. \u201cFor me, it reminds me of the men I lost in combat in Vietnam and it gives me chills. I went into combat at Ca Lu with 225 Marines and I came out with only 163. When I hear the volleys, I see their faces.\u201d UVa President Jim Ryan said he was pleased that the volley would return to the ceremony, which has been held for more than a decade. \u201cAs the son of a Korean War veteran, I have always believed in honoring the men and women who have served our country in the armed forces,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cI am grateful to our ROTC program for the 24-hour vigil and Veterans Day ceremony they put on each year, and I\u2019m glad we\u2019re able to bring the 21-gun salute back as part of the ceremony.\u201d","261":"UVa patients were eligible early in the virus\u2019 first wave for treatments through studies that included the recently approved drug remdesivir, other drugs, plasma containing COVID antibodies and treatment with stem cells. \u201cWhen the pandemic first started, the Health System leadership realized there was a lot of opportunity to do research and studies but that we had a duty to use our resources wisely,\u201d said Dr. Linda Duska, associate dean for clinical research at the UVa School of Medicine. \u201cWe wanted to put into practice a way to get our patients the opportunity to participate in as many studies as possible, but to make sure that those studies would benefit them,\u201d she said. \u201cWe needed to make sure the studies fit the patients.\u201d For Dr. Kyle Enfield, medical director for the UVa hospital\u2019s intensive care unit and a specialist in treating acute respiratory distress syndrome, the question was how to make studies fit with caring for patients critically ill with a disease about which next to nothing was known. \u201cWe needed to take care of the patients on the front lines first,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the same time, we needed to find better ways to care for them and what could help them, and that\u2019s why research was important.\u201d What they did was develop a series of committees that looked at proposed trials and studies, available funding and staffing needs to determine if the research likely would benefit patients and if critical care teams had time and resources enough to implement it. The goals were to keep patients as safe as possible, stick to best practices and reinforce medical ethics. \u201cThat\u2019s what made this unique. The difference is we have collaboration where the researchers are working with the clinicians on the front lines and the leadership to make decisions,\u201d Enfield said. \u201cWe looked at all aspects, from the resources the studies take to the goals, and the pragmatic aspects of whether we can do it and still provide quality care.\u201d Enfield said having different types of experts on the committees helped staff to implement study protocols without interrupting patient care. \u201cWe knew we could provide really good critical and clinical care but we had nothing to provide patients with in this particular disease,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are always a lot of competing interests but we realized we had to work together. We knew we couldn\u2019t compete with each other because we had limited resources and we needed to provide a high standard of care to the patients.\u201d Enfield said he believes feedback from caregivers has helped to improve research protocols. \u201cIt\u2019s helped researchers form the questions better. When we say, \u2018we can\u2019t do that many blood draws and still take care of everyone we need to take care of,\u2019 they can look and see if that\u2019s something they can do in another way or combine blood tests,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s helped us out, the researchers out and the patients.\u201d With the committees and process in place, the team was ready. Within 10 days of the first patient\u2019s admission to UVa Medical Center with a COVID-19 diagnosis, the first trial for the antiviral remdesivir was up and running in the hospital. The study was conducted in three waves: the drug against a placebo; the drug plus an approved treatment for rheumatoid arthritis against the drug and a placebo; and a study where the drug was combined with a treatment used for multiple sclerosis against the drug and placebo combination. The UVa study, and similar studies at other hospitals across the country, continued through the summer. On Oct. 22, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the drug, also known by its trade name Veklury, for use in patients 12 and older and weighing at least 90 pounds. The committees also sought to bring racial equity into the studies. They wanted the participants in the studies to accurately reflect the patients they were treating on the hospital wards and intensive care units. It worked. An estimated 57% of hospitalized patients agreed to participate in a study. Of those, 23% were Black and 31% were Hispanic\/Latino. Of patients hospitalized for COVID-19 at UVa, 28% are Black and 22% are Hispanic\/Latino. \u201cWe\u2019ve been able to offer clinical trials to all eligible patients. We enrolled a large number of Black and Hispanic patients in our trials, and our enrollment for Blacks and Hispanics pretty much matches the percentages that we see in the units,\u201d Duska said. \u201cNonwhite people are disproportionately affected by this virus and need access.\u201d \u201cThe fact that we were able to recruit so many is amazing,\u201d Enfield said. \u201cThere is a long history of mistrust of medicine in those communities. The fact that we\u2019ve been able to improve on that is good. I\u2019m really proud that we\u2019ve been able to do this in a way that really works well for our patients.\u201d With several studies competing for participants, hospital staff was faced with the problem of how to sign up which patients for which study. In a world of computerized statistical analysis and cross-comparison matrices, they went old school. \u201cWe went with the calendar,\u201d Enfield said. \u201cIn a hospital setting, you never know how things are going to go. One day you may have zero patients come in the door and the next you have three and the next 10 and the next zero. If you take seven days in a row, you spread out those zero days. So you enroll people one week in one study. The next week you enroll new patients in another. When one study shuts down, another opens up.\u201d Although the number of studies has been limited, Enfield and Duska believe their patients have been well served. \u201cWe recognize we\u2019re not New York City. We have a lower volume of patients, and that\u2019s good,\u201d Duska said. \u201cBecause of that, we choose the studies we commit to very carefully. We\u2019ve been able to provide scientific data other universities were not. We develop our studies to focus on our strengths.\u201d Duska said clinical research doesn\u2019t make money but the results pay off in better care and better outcomes. Enfield agrees. \u201cWhen you participate in a study, you\u2019re getting something new and different that we think could provide some benefit. Without participation, we don\u2019t really know for sure how well it is working.\u201d he said. \u201cWe need clinical trials. Otherwise, we just don\u2019t have the information, and that\u2019s what drives medical care,\u201d Enfield said. \u201cThere\u2019s only so far you can go with computer screens and some cells in a petri dish.\u201d","262":"President Donald Trump\u2019s legal challenges are unlikely to impact the outcome of the election, but they could impact the future of mail-in voting, according to experts who spoke during a virtual University of Virginia panel Monday. Hosted by UVa\u2019s Miller Center, the hour long panel discussion focused on the legal issues arising from the 2020 presidential election, including lawsuits filed by the Trump campaign, the possibility of recounts and the role of federal courts. The panel featured three speakers: a Daniel R. Ortiz, UVa law professor and director of Supreme Court Litigation Clinic; Bertrall Ross, a Chancellor\u2019s Professor of Law at University of California Berkeley School of Law; and Myrna P\u00e9rez, director of Voting Rights & Elections at the Brennan Center for Justice. Ortiz began the panel by sharing his insight into the lawsuits filed by Trump and his campaign, all of which are unlikely to succeed, he said. Trump has claimed that, despite polling results, he has not lost the election to Democrat Joe Biden and that he is the victim of widespread voter fraud. These assertions are thus far baseless. The lawsuits fall into a few sets, Ortiz said. Some of the cases involve poll watching and arguments from the Trump campaign that its poll watchers did not have adequate access. Other lawsuits are accusing poll workers of \u201cballot curing,\u201d or fixing ballots, Ortiz said, and a few other lawsuits are concerned with poor ballot instructions, such as \u201cSharpiegate\u201d in which a false rumor spread that ballots filled out with Sharpie markers would not be counted. The problem with these accusations is that there\u2019s usually not much evidence to support them, Ortiz said, pointing to the poll watching situations where the issue affects both Republicans and Democrats equally and have been resolved already. \u201cThe other problem with them is that when there is evidence, there\u2019s usually no problem,\u201d Ortiz said. \u201cFor example, the claim that Nevada is accepting out of state ballots may be true, but it\u2019s been pointed out that that\u2019s legal; out of state students, military and other people have the right to send their ballots in from out of state.\u201d In theory, Ortiz said the pressure the Trump campaign is putting on states where the vote is closer, like Pennsylvania and Arizona, could set off a complicated process that begins with the state legislatures appointing electors and a subsequent refutation by Congress. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s actually much to worry about here, you\u2019d have to have a lot of pressure to create state legislators and critical ones to actually take this leap and override the democratic vote in those states,\u201d Ortiz said. \u201cAlready, the leaders of the Pennsylvania state legislature seem to be throwing some cold water on the idea.\u201d During her portion of the panel, P\u00e9rez highlighted the various ways states across the nation updated their voting rules to account for the COVID-19 pandemic and, broadly, make voting by mail and voting early easier and more accessible. Much of this was playing catch-up, she said, and showed how our electoral systems are not designed to handle stresses. \u201cI think it took the potential of the widespread disenfranchisement of people who are usually not disenfranchised to move policymakers into making our elections more resilient and making sure that voters had more options,\u201d she said. Though there was a huge growth in mail-in voting this election, Ross said he was not sure that this trend would continue, in part because mail-in voting may be seen in future elections as disproportionately benefitting Democratic candidates. \u201cThe combination of President Trump and the Trump campaign\u2019s so far are baseless assertions that mail-in voting is infected with fraud and the fact that the decision of Democrats to mostly vote by mail and Republicans to mostly vote in person, could reinforce the narrative and mail-in ballots are good for Democrats and bad for Republicans,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we know that once that narrative takes hold, it is hard to achieve reform in the absence of a unified, partisan government at the state level.\u201d In order to predict the future of mail-in voting, Ross said all eyes have turned to the two run-off Senate elections in Georgia. If Democrats win both those elections then they will effectively have a majority in the Senate as well as the House of Representatives, opening the path to voting reform via a unified Congress. However, if Republicans win one or both of the Senate elections, maintaining their Senate majority, then a split government will make the path to more widespread mail-in voting and other voting reform more difficult. During the audience question portion of the panel, Ortiz reiterated that, even if some of Trump\u2019s lawsuits are successful, they are unlikely to change the results of the election. \u201cEven if they were successful I don\u2019t think they\u2019re going to be changing enough numbers at this point to make a difference,\u201d he said. \u201cWhich is one of the reasons why I think it\u2019s very unlikely to end up in the Supreme Court, even though some justice may be interested in taking up the Pennsylvania case.\u201d Answering another question, P\u00e9rez said she thought the media had done a good job explaining to voters what was at stake in the election, but did a poor job explaining that some isolated voter issues were not a national problem. \u201cI cannot tell you how many times I was on a radio show, when a voter would call in and say, \u2018Oh, I\u2019m really worried that my vote is not, my mail ballot is not going to count because of signature matching\u2019 and they were in a state that doesn\u2019t have a robust signature matching requirement,\u201d she said. In order to avoid a \u201cdoom-spiral,\u201d P\u00e9rez said the media should try to \u201csize-up\u201d worry instead of making hypothetical situations seem more likely than they are.","263":"University of Virginia students will get to choose whether they take courses for credit or letters in both the upcoming January term and spring term courses, continuing a policy from the fall term. UVa Provost Liz Magill sent a message to students Monday night to tell them that, in the face of the pandemic, the school will extend the grading policy used for the fall term for both upcoming terms. The system allows students to choose whether to take classes for letter grades, which impact overall grade point averages, or for credit\/general credit\/no credit, which will not impact averages. Last spring, the university switched students to the credit\/no credit program when students were sent home and classes switched to online. Fall term started with students facing traditional letter grade courses, but administrators brought back the credit\/no credit system after students petitioned for it. Students must choose the credit-based grading system when enrolling in the month-long January, or J-term, classes. If they don\u2019t, the default grade system will be letter grades. Registration began on Monday. Classes begin Jan. 4. \u201cAs was the case with our decision about the fall grading option, there were many factors that influenced our thought process,\u201d Magill said in the letter. \u201cUltimately, we sought to balance serious concerns raised by students, faculty, and staff about the effects of this pandemic on many of our students, while at the same time honoring the views of those students and faculty who seek to give or receive standard grades.\u201d Courses taken for credit will count toward curricular, academic major and graduation requirements. Magill said the credit grading system will not prevent students from applying for particular academic programs, research-intensive programs or transferring between schools in the university. Schools may not use the number of classes taken on a for-credit basis or grade point averages as sole reasons for admitting or denying admission to a student. There is a \u2018but,\u2019 however. \u201cStudents should be mindful of other potential implications of selecting or not selecting a [credit basis] grade in some or all of their classes,\u201d Magill wrote. \u201cFor instance, students who need to increase their GPA for graduation purposes or to remain eligible for financial aid should factor that into their decision.\u201d Magill said those graduate programs that offered the credit-based grades in the fall term will also offer them for J-term and spring term. Professional schools will announce their decisions later. For undergraduate students who opt into the credit grading, a credit received, or CR, will be given for meeting class requirements, which is the equivalent of a C-grade or above. General credit, or GC, will be given to students who pass a class with less than a C and no credit, or NC, will be given for the equivalent of an F-letter grade. UVa officials made the switch from all-letter grades to the combination of either this fall after students signed petitions and presented surveys showing that a significant number of students were having difficulty dealing with changes both at school and in the community related to COVID-19. At the time, Magill said the change was made to an optional credit-based grade system \u201cafter many exchanges with students, student leaders, and faculty and staff who work most closely with students.\u201d UVa\u2019s Student Council conducted a survey of students prior to the fall term and found that 96.7% of respondents faced barriers to learning in the spring term and that almost 70% expected similar barriers to surface in the fall. The survey listed 14 specific barriers to learning that students may face, including trouble focusing on school when studying off-grounds; poor internet connectivity; difficulty learning via Zoom and other virtual class methods; lack of a suitable study place at home; family relationships; and financial insecurity as well as loneliness and other mental health issues. \u201cBased on our survey, students with no barriers to learning prefer a regular grading system, while students with barriers to learning are the most likely to support the default [credit-based] system with opt-in letter grades,\u201d the study states. The study showed just short of 80% of students said they had difficulty focusing when living off-Grounds or away from school and that it could be a barrier to learning and Zoom and other virtual networks were difficult for 77.6% of students. Only 11.6% of survey respondents indicated that the credit-based system hampered their motivation. The survey showed about 3% of students said they found no barriers to learning during the spring term and more than half of those said they preferred the letter-grade system. Of those who faced all of the barriers listed in the survey, most preferred the option of either credit-based and letter-based grades. \u201cStudents who indicated that they faced no barriers to learning were far more likely to opt-in to all or mostly letter grades, and were far more likely to be satisfied with their choice [of letter grades],\u201d the survey states. \u201cOn the other hand, students who faced all 14 of the predefined barriers were far more split in their selection of grading system.\u201d","264":"An estimated 170 medical personnel in the University of Virginia Medical Center\u2019s pediatric intensive care unit were exposed to a COVID-19 positive patient last weekend, but caregivers are continuing to work pending their own tests to avoid shutting down the unit. Hospital officials said they implemented \u2018critical staffing protocols\u2019 that increase testing frequency for the staff, require additional personal protective gear and additional screening to keep the children\u2019s ICU open. Under normal circumstances, those caregivers exposed to a positive-testing patient would be placed on paid administrative leave for 14 days to quarantine. But with the majority of the unit\u2019s staff being exposed, that was not possible, officials said. \u201cBecause it affected our pediatric intensive care unit, the number of people that would be furloughed means that we couldn\u2019t provide care for these critically ill children and we\u2019re one of the few places in the state that has that level of care,\u201d said Dr. Reid Adams, chief medical officer for the medical center. \u201cWe had to go to a critical staffing protocol in this case. Otherwise, we\u2019d have to close the pediatric intensive care unit down and we just couldn\u2019t do that with 17 critically ill children [in the unit].\u201d Officials said a child came to the hospital in critical condition and needed several emergency procedures. The child tested negative for COVID-19 upon admittance. About eight days later, a positive test of a family member was reported to the hospital and the child was retested and proved positive for the SARS-CoV-2 virus. \u201cThe child was incredibly sick and required about a half-dozen different medical teams to provide care in a number of emergency situations,\u201d Adams said. Dr. Wendy Horton, chief operating officer of the medical center, said the child is recovering and that the unit\u2019s care saved the child\u2019s life. She said those staff members who have since been tested have been negative. Adams said elective surgeries that might require a pediatric patient to recover in the intensive care unit have been postponed. Those children already in the unit, and any emergency patients that may transfer from other hospitals for a higher level of care at UVa, will continue to be served. \u201cWe receive a lot of patients from around the region and provide care that\u2019s not readily available in other areas,\u201d Adams said. \u201cAny patient whose care would not adversely affected by a delay will be postponed until this is resolved.\u201d The exposure is at least the second this month to hit a hospital unit. About a week ago, a patient in the cardiac care unit was diagnosed with COVID-19, requiring several caregivers to go on administrative leave for quarantine. There was limited exposure in that case, officials said. The unit was not closed down and exposed staff were not asked to continue working. \u201cWe were able to continue to function and take care of people who needed cardiac care, even with people going on [leave],\u201d Adams said. That unit is completely reopened and staff has returned, he said. Considering how easily the virus is transmitted, officials said they feel fortunate there have been only a few cases of exposure. \u201cWe\u2019ve been fortunate in that we\u2019ve had relatively few events, but we\u2019ve had three or four exposures, all of them smaller [in number of staff exposed],\u201d Adams said. \u201cMost have been related to patients who have tested negative [on admission] and then test positive. There have been one or two where staff unknowingly were positive and where the epidemiologist, through contact tracing, figured out there were some potential exposure.\u201d Although officials say they are trying to limit the number unexpected COVID cases through testing and protocols, COVID-19 has a knack of showing up wherever there are people. \u201cEverybody expects that we\u2019ll have some of these. Those no real way to avoid it, no matter how much testing you do or how careful you are,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re all human and it only takes one little slip or drop of the mask.\u201d So far, UVa\u2019s record is good, Horton said, especially compared to some hotspots across the country. \u201cWhen you talk to our colleagues across the nation, I feel very fortunate we\u2019ve had few inpatients [testing positive post admission] and few exposures among staff,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen we compare ourselves to El Paso, [Texas] or Madison, Wisconsin, we\u2019re incredibly fortunate about how we\u2019ve limited COVID.\u201d On Nov. 4, hospital administrators announced they would expand testing for all patients and any staff who are \u2018worried, but well.\u2019 On Nov. 6, the hospital increased to 100 the number of tests available to medical school and hospital faculty, employees and staff. The goal is to increase the number to 300 tests within a few weeks. Tests will be limited to one per employee every 14 days. So far, the positivity rate for COVID-19 tests among the UVa Health staff has been less than 1% officials said. Plans are in place to provide tests for patients admitted to the hospital through the emergency department, outside hospitals, clinics and other sources at the time of admission. Rapid testing will be used for symptomatic and high-risk patients, including those who live in nursing homes, care facilities and prisons or jails. Beginning later this month, the hospital will also require patients needing intubation or other procedures that could produce aerosols to receive a negative COVID-19 test within five days of the procedure. COVID-19 is easily transmitted by aerosols, tiny particles of moisture exhaled during conversation, singing or heavy breathing. Some research studies show that aerosols may be the most effective mode of transmission and that has led public health officials to push wearing face masks as a way to cut down the amount of airborne virus. \u201cOperationalizing and implementing this new testing regimen will take some time and tremendous work by our clinical and administrative teams,\u201d hospital administrators said in a Nov. 4 message to staff. \u201cThis increase in testing will not in any way reduce our ability to continue our community testing.\u201d The administrators said the ability to increase testing frequency is due to the hospital\u2019s medical laboratory team working \u201crelentlessly since March to increase our testing capacity.\u201d Reid said despite the protocols and testing regimen, it\u2019s likely that exposures will happen again. \u201cNo matter how many policies and rules you put in place, it only takes a brief second to be exposed and tests are only as good as the day they were taken,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen patients test negative and several days later it\u2019s a positive.\u201d Horton said she is hopeful the procedures will make any future exposures limited in scope. \u201cWe now have really good [personal protective equipment] and protocols in place but we need to reassess every day what we\u2019re doing and where we\u2019re at,\u201d she said. \u201cAs we approach the holidays it\u2019s really important to continue to be aware. People are feeling COVID-fatigue and we need to continue to do the right things.\u201d","265":"As COVID-19 cases surge nationally, Gov. Ralph Northam announced Friday new restrictions limiting public and private gatherings to no more than 25 people along with other measures that will go into effect at midnight Sunday. The measures, which include stopping alcohol sales at 10 p.m., stepping up enforcement of existing COVID state guidelines and expanding the state\u2019s mask mandate, are expected to hamper an already struggling local restaurant industry as well as wineries and breweries with large events, such as weddings, on their calendars. Northam\u2019s announcement comes ahead of the holiday season when many officials are worried that families will gather indoors and potentially further spread the virus. The state is averaging 1,500 new days per day, up from a previous statewide peak of 1,200, according to a news release. The restrictions do not apply to schools or churches or limit the capacity of restaurants and other businesses. A spokeswoman for Northam said that the gathering restrictions would mean a restaurant, including breweries and wineries, cannot seat groups over 25 people or host private parties and social events. But, they can still have more than 25 people on their premises. The Charlottesville City Council and Albemarle County Board of Supervisors moved over the summer to enact tighter restrictions than the state. The local COVID-19 ordinances make masks mandatory in public, limit restaurants to 50% occupancy indoors and restrict certain public and private in-person gatherings to a maximum of 50 people. The Board of Supervisors will hold a public hearing Nov. 18 to discuss whether to extend the ordinance another 60 days. Area restaurant owners have worried about the coming winter months when the cold weather would make outdoor dining less viable. Many have relied on outdoor dining and carry out to continue operating, and several have not survived. \u201cIt\u2019s devastating,\u201d said Roy Van Doorn, the Charlottesville chair of the Virginia Restaurant Lodging and Travel Association, adding that he\u2019s also concerned about the rising case numbers. \u201cIt\u2019s going to affect thousands of people who work in hospitality and in the wedding industry.\u201d Van Doorn said the industry has been working very hard to stay afloat and keep staff and customers safe, and pointed out the area\u2019s low positivity rate. \u201cIt\u2019s challenging when we have events like weddings and receptions canceled with three days notice,\u201d he said. Not all of the new restrictions will have an effect, such as the expanded mask requirement, he said. But he expects people to get nervous and cancel their small- and medium-sized parties or dinners. \u201cIt will have an effect,\u201d he said. He encouraged people to call their favorite restaurant and order carry out to keep them going. George Hodson, with Veritas Winery, said that aside from weddings and events, he\u2019s not expecting the new restrictions to have a huge impact on them, since the establishment closes before 10 p.m. He\u2019s also president of the Monticello Wine Trail and the Virginia Wineries Association. Hodson said the restrictions will again increase the level of uncertainty. \u201cThe goal posts are moving again,\u201d he said. \u201c... For those trying to plan for spring weddings, this creates a new seed of uncertainty.\u201d Hodson, who had served on Northam\u2019s task force for reopening the economy, said he didn\u2019t have a heads up on the new restrictions. \u201cI\u2019m grateful he gave us the weekend,\u201d he said. Northam said in a news release that he didn\u2019t want to wait until cases surge in Virginia. \u201cWe are acting now to prevent this health crisis from getting worse,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cEveryone is tired of this pandemic and restrictions on our lives. I\u2019m tired, and I know you are tired too. But as we saw earlier this year, these mitigation measures work. I am confident that we can come together as one Commonwealth to get this virus under control and save lives.\u201d The governor\u2019s office said that all five of the health regions in the state are currently reporting a positivity rate over five percent, and southwest Virginia has experienced a spike in the number of cases. Hospitalizations have increased by more than 35% in the last month though hospital capacity remains stable. As of Friday, Charlottesville averaged 15.4 new cases per 100,000 residents over the last seven days. Albemarle averaged 5.7, while the state overall was at 17.6. Another metric often used to assess the virus\u2019 spread is the percent of positive cases over seven days, which was 2.1% on Friday for the Thomas Jefferson Health District. Public health officials have attributed the low local percent positivity rate to the amount of testing happening at the University of Virginia. Testing numbers have increased dramatically in recent months as UVa tested more students regularly. For example, in the last week, 10,461 tests have been administered in the health district, and the average number of daily tests for this month is 1,229. In August, the average was 451. Earlier this week, Northam announced new contracts to increase the state\u2019s public health testing capacity. Contracts with Virginia Tech in Blacksburg, University of Virginia Medical Center in Charlottesville, and Sentara Healthcare in Norfolk will directly support high-priority outbreak investigations, community testing events, and testing in congregate settings, according to the news release. Their goal is to be able to perform 7,000 per day by the end of the year.","266":"Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, will speak on \"COVID-19: Public Health and Scientific Challenges\u201d from noon to 1 p.m. Wednesday, according to a news release.

Charlottesville residents have reported numerous parties in the Rugby Road area with students ignoring masking, attendance limits and social distancing. Residents reported one party on Saturday afternoon near Gordon Avenue and 17th Street NW. UVa Dean of Students Allen W. Grove sent a message Sunday reminding students that they agreed to follow school-mandated anti-COVID measures and that violations will be referred to the University Judiciary Committee. \u201cLast week, we received a concerning report of a very large gathering of students at a local winery in Albemarle County in which none of the critical public health requirements were followed by those in attendance. We are looking into this incident with the assistance of the winery and we hope it does not turn out to have been the super-spreader event we have tried so hard to avoid,\u201d Groves wrote. \u201cThis weekend, too, saw a few large gatherings in the [Gordon Avenue and Rugby Road] area,\u201d he wrote. \u201cOnce again, we will look to our student-run [justice system] to address these violations of policy that put the community at risk.\u201d Thomas Jefferson Health District officials said they had not received a complaint of student violations from local wineries. They said that\u2019s not odd as complaints are often directed to the university if it involves recognized UVa student organizations or groups clearly composed of students. The district has, however, seen COVID cases caused by community gatherings and events. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen an increase in cases from large social gatherings and from smaller social gatherings, as well,\u201d said Kathryn Goodman, health district spokeswoman. \u201cIt\u2019s possible to spread COVID any time you have even two households meeting together and that\u2019s a concern as the holidays approach.\u201d District statistics show that since Nov. 1, there have been 53 complaints of face mask noncompliance at grocery and convenience stores; 45 at retail stores; two at breweries and wineries; two at barber\/beauty shops, five at gyms and three at recreational sporting events. Officials said they received 116 complaints aimed at restaurants but determined many were invalid or unsubstantiated. Of the 2,504 complaints the local health district has received since the pandemic began, 2,362 are about failure to wear face masks. At UVa, complaints are handled through the school\u2019s judiciary committee and are divided into three types. Those include unintentional or accidental violations that \u201coccur infrequently, without the intent to harm or disrupt\u201d and are promptly addressed; intentional or reckless violations that threaten health or safety; and repeated violations. The committee may order meetings with members of Grove\u2019s office; investigate or hold a trial; or invoke an interim suspension. There were multiple reports on social media this weekend of large groups of students hanging out neither masked nor socially distant. Reports have also circulated among students and community members on social media regarding student gatherings eschewing COVID-19 restrictions since Halloween. Goodman said last week\u2019s tightening of restrictions by Gov. Ralph Northam is designed to decrease transmission of the disease as cold weather pushes social contact indoors, the perfect location for spreading the virus. \u201cWe don\u2019t want people to live in fear, but we do want them to live cautiously,\u201d she said. \u201cIt seems like COVID has been here a long time and we\u2019re all tired of it and that includes those of us who deal with it every day.\u201d Groves warned students that the restrictions are likely to continue for the foreseeable future, not just at UVa but also in their home communities. \u201cThe pandemic is far from over despite recent promising news in vaccine development and our lower-than-national average case numbers in the local health district,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAs you know, the number of cases has swelled nationwide and in many spots around the world. Predictions suggest some difficult months lie ahead as the weather turns colder, affording fewer outdoor activities, and the holidays beckon, tempting everyone with travel and family gatherings.\u201d Groves said UVa officials expect those students who are not permanent local residents to return to their homes and not come back to Charlottesville until just prior to the February start of spring semester. He said they should stay at home once they get there. \u201cBack-and-forth travel puts yourself and many others at risk, especially at a time when cases are increasing and resources are being strained in many parts of the country,\u201d he wrote. UVa students will be required to test for COVID-19 prior to returning in February, Grove said. Students may receive pre-departure COVID-19 tests for the Thanksgiving break and those living off-grounds were given appointments last week. Those who did not receive the emails should email prevalence-test@virginia.edu and make other arrangements for a test. Increases in COVID-19 cases are leading to spikes in nursing homes, rehabilitation facilities and other institutions where residents live in close quarters, according to a report by the American Health Care Association\/National Center for Assisted Living. Figures released show cases shot up from 6,622 across the country in mid-October to 10,279 on Nov. 1. Deaths rose in that same period from 1,000 a week in nursing homes and facilities across the nation to more than 1,400. \u201cOur worst fears have come true as COVID runs rampant among the general population and long term care facilities are powerless to fully prevent it from entering due to its asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic spread,\u201d said Mark Parkinson, president and CEO of the both organizations, in an email. \u201cThis level of COVID nationwide puts serious strain on our workforce, supplies, and testing capacity.\u201d In nearby Staunton, administrators at the Middle River Regional Jail announced Tuesday that 10 staff members \u2013 nine officers and a nurse \u2013 tested positive for the virus and are self-isolating at home. Other staff is also isolating pending test results. To deal with the disease and the staff shortage, jail officials are canceling visitation and other programs, limiting inmate movement through the jail and turned the recreational yard into a COVID isolation unit. UVa health officials recommend students minimize contact with others before leaving for the break. Anyone testing positive or in close contact with someone who is COVID-19 positive prior to leaving is required to isolate. For students living on Grounds, isolation and quarantine spaces will remain available during breaks. Goodman said the large number of students repeatedly being tested has skewed the community\u2019s positivity rate, which is often used to determine how prevalent the virus is in the region. \u201cWe don\u2019t want the public to have a false sense of security. We\u2019re doing OK, but we have seen an increase in community cases over the past two months,\u201d she said. \u201cCOVID is far more common now than it was in March and we understand people have COVID fatigue and are tired of all the restrictions, but we need to be extra careful with winter coming.\u201d Goodman said similar steps should be taken by the community at-large as holidays loom. \u201cThe chances of spreading the virus increase dramatically when you have two or more households that get together indoors for a period of time,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s best to have a holiday with only the immediate family. It\u2019s a terrible thing to say, but this year has been very unique.\u201d","268":"Hosted as part of the UVa School of Medicine\u2019s Medical Center Hour, Fauci gave an expansive virtual lecture on COVID-19 and the challenges it poses. The director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases National Institutes of Health has become a well-known public figure in recent months due to his work addressing the COVID-19 pandemic, even inspiring the name suggestion of \u201cDr. Anthony Fautree\u201d for Charlottesville\u2019s Grand Illumination tree. Fauci\u2019s lecture covered the beginning of the virus as well as the latest developments in COVID-19 epidemiology, transmission and prevention of transmission and other related topics. Given the recent media attention on two vaccines, both of which have shown to be 95% effective in clinical trials, Fauci said it may be tempting for people to become more lax with safety protocols. However, with the growing case numbers in the United States and the holiday season arriving, he said now is not the time to stop taking precautions, such as maintaining social distancing and wearing masks. \u201cWe don\u2019t want that to be a signal to the community that we have a vaccine so let your guard down,\u201d he said. \u201cNo, it should actually be an incentive to double down until we get everybody vaccinated.\u201d Citing a recent report, Fauci said only around 50% of Americans have expressed a likelihood to get vaccinated, posing a difficulty for reaching herd immunity, which would need to be around 75-80% of the population. Rates of trust in a vaccine are lower in minority communities, Fauci said, which is also a concern due to the higher rates of COVID-19 infections in these communities. Community figures of trust will need to reach out in order to sway these communities to trust a vaccine, Fauci said. When answering an audience question later in the lecture, Fauci said other ways to convince people to get the vaccine would depend on their reasons for avoiding it. If it is an issue of access, then wider, more affordable access is key, but some people have expressed concerns that the process was rushed. Fauci urged people with concerns to look into the process of approval, which he said has been transparent and independent. \u201cBecause of a lot of the noise that comes out of Washington, in this divisive time that we\u2019re living in some people may say, \u2018Well, I don\u2019t really trust that they try to rush this out to look good,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI can tell you, this has been an independent decision and it has been done in the classic way that decisions are made about vaccine safety and efficacy.\u201d In terms of how the vaccine will be distributed, Fauci showed part of a presentation the National Academy gave the Centers for Disease Control. The potential model was broken into four phases, with medical workers and those at high risk in the first category, teachers and other essential workers in the second and others with certain risks in the third. The thought behind the suggested model is to administer the vaccine to those most at risk initially, he said, though ultimately the distribution decision will be left up to the CDC. Fauci also cautioned that with the seasonal change, more cases of asymptomatic spread are being traced back to innocent occurrences such as groups of friends and family meeting indoors because of the cold weather. A week ahead of Thanksgiving, this is cause for particular concern as many plan to see family for the holiday. \u201cFamilies need to make an individual decision based on those in the family that might be vulnerable, such as the elderly and those with underlying conditions again,\u201d he said. A more recent discovery is that the virus can be transmitted via aerosol particles that linger in the air for a while, particularly in areas with poor ventilation, Fauci said. While the virus can be transmitted this way, Fauci qualified that the amount of spread this way is hard to measure but likely smaller and can be offset by wearing masks and taking other precautions. The hour-long lecture, which was viewed by more than 1,000 people live, will be posted within four days to the Medical Center Hour\u2019s YouTube channel.","269":"The University of Virginia is dealing with additional reports that students are not following COVID restrictions, thus endangering the health not only of themselves but of those with whom they come in contact at wineries, breweries and restaurants. When last we dealt with this topic in this space, UVa was tightening restrictions on the number of people permitted to gather in one space, from 15 to five. The tougher limits were set to run for two weeks. The university said the restrictions were not a reaction to an increase in COVID protocol violations by students. Instead, the restrictions were intended to be pre-emptive \u2014 to prevent an uptick in health risks due to close gatherings. Prior to that, UVa had made clear to students returning to classes that they would be expected to wear masks, avoid large social gatherings and practice other common-sense safety measures. Yet from the beginning, there have been reports of large gatherings at which students partied in close proximity and without wearing masks \u2014 often with photos floating around on social media as evidence. Recent weeks have seen another rash of such complaints. Charlottesville residents have reported several weekend parties in the greater Rugby Road area, as well as a large student gathering at an area winery weekend before last. On Nov. 15, UVa Dean of Students Allen W. Grove reminded students that they had agreed to follow COVID protocols as a condition of being allowed to return to classes, and noted that violations will be referred to the University Judiciary Committee. In late September, UVa had suspended several students for violating COVID health rules. We had hoped that knowing the university would take sanctions seriously would compel students similarly to take health rules seriously. And perhaps they did, up to a point \u2014 until the end of the semester approached simultaneously with unseasonably warm autumn weather, luring people out of doors. When officials urge people to get outside to boost their mental and physical health, they are recommending hikes or outdoor play by individuals or small, closely related groups \u2014 socially distanced and masked as appropriate. It is not healthy for large groups to congregate outdoors or indoors, irresponsibly unmasked. This has implications for us all. While it might be cynically vengeful to consign the students to the consequences of their own actions, the consequences don\u2019t stop there. Also placed at risk are servers or other patrons at bars, restaurants, wineries and the like. And then there\u2019s the issue of overloading the health-care system. If hospitals must care for sick students, who could so easily have protected themselves from illness, then hospital capacity is reduced for others in need \u2014 whether COVID patients or those suffering from other illnesses or injuries. Meanwhile, the question of deterrence through punishment is still an open one. What level of punishment would be effective \u2014 and do we even actually want that? If hundreds of students must be suspended in order to enforce good behavior on the remaining thousands, are the university and the community prepared to go to those lengths? There is also the issue of due process. Because university rules are at stake, alleged violations of COVID protocols are referred to the University Judiciary Committee. But the university judiciary process may not be adequate for the current task \u2014 as is the case with so many processes and systems in the COVID era. If and until the campus judicial system returns enough guilty verdicts and sanctions enough violators to catch students\u2019 attention, we are left with the current \u2014 and apparently ineffectual \u2014 approach: simply warning students that they are at risk of punishment.","270":"I must admit that I was skeptical it could be done. The checking of dormitory wastewater was a brilliant idea and helped a great deal. Thank you for taking this pandemic seriously, and we hope to see you back in the spring. Ellen Hawkins Albemarle County","271":"A clinical trial based on University of Virginia research suggests an antidepressant may prevent coronavirus infections from worsening and may keep patients out of the hospital. The trial, conducted by the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, compared outcomes of those taking fluvoxamine with effects of the coronavirus. The trial focused on 152 patients infected with the virus, with 80 participants receiving fluvoxamine and the rest getting a placebo. None of those who took fluvoxamine became seriously ill after 15 days, while six patients who received placebo did. Of those six, four were hospitalized, for periods ranging from four to 21 days. One was on a ventilator for 10 days. The trial was based on research by UVa\u2019s Alban Gaultier and former graduate student Dorian A. Rosen. The pair found last year that the drug may stop the deadly inflammation of sepsis. Their research found the drug reduced the production of certain cells allowing the inflammation to spread. The same cells are believed to be connected to severe cases of coronavirus. \u201cThe patients who took fluvoxamine did not develop serious breathing difficulties or require hospitalization for problems with lung function,\u201d Dr. Eric J. Lenze of the Washington University School of Medicine, said in a press release. \u201cMost investigational treatments for COVID-19 have been aimed at the very sickest patients, but it\u2019s also important to find therapies that prevent patients from getting sick enough to require supplemental oxygen or to have to go to the hospital. Our study suggests fluvoxamine may help fill that niche.\u201d The Washington University team noted that some recent research has raised questions about whether the same cells are really involved with COVID-19 deaths. If not, the researchers say, fluvoxamine may be having beneficial effects by some other mechanism not yet understood. \u201cThere are several ways this drug might work to help COVID-19 patients,\u201d Washington University\u2019s Dr. Angela M. Reiersen said in a press release. \u201cPast research has demonstrated that fluvoxamine can reduce inflammation in animal models of sepsis, and it may be doing something similar in our patients.\u201d The researchers cautioned against too much optimism from their trial as it was limited and had some setbacks. About 20% of participants stopped answering surveys during the 15-day trail. While none of those participants required hospitalization, researchers couldn\u2019t determine if they had sought treatment elsewhere. The researchers have published their trial results in the Journal of the American Medical Association. They plan to launch a larger trial in the next few weeks.","272":"RICHMOND \u2014 College students across the state are leaving campuses this week and returning home as cases of the coronavirus are surging nationwide and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends people not travel for the Thanksgiving holiday. Administrators are trying to ensure that when their students go home, they don\u2019t take the coronavirus with them and spread it to older, more vulnerable family members. Young, otherwise healthy people are more likely to transmit the virus without displaying symptoms. Most colleges in Virginia opted not to hold a traditional Thanksgiving break. Instead, they either ended in-person instruction last week or are doing so this week, and finishing the semester after the holiday in a completely remote format. At Virginia Commonwealth University, freshman students have to leave on-campus residences by Wednesday morning. But the university made accommodations for a small number who wished to stay, school spokesman Michael Porter said. Students who requested to return to their dorms after Thanksgiving to finish classes and take their finals were allowed to do so. Many upper-class dorms, which are apartment-style, remain open 12 months a year, allowing students to remain during the holiday if they wish. Students with symptoms or positive tests can stay in the university\u2019s isolation housing. About 4,400 students live on campus this semester, though full capacity is closer to 6,500. VCU offered students the opportunity to be tested before going home, and between 1,300 and 1,400 opted in, Porter said. Of the first 700 to 800 results that returned, only one person tested positive, he said. Virginia Tech asked its students to be especially careful in the last two weeks before going home, and it is offering them testing before they leave. In-person instruction there ended Friday. Frank Shushok, Virginia Tech\u2019s vice president for student affairs, urged students to keep making good decisions and encourage others to follow suit at home. The University of Virginia is requiring that all of its students, both on-campus and off, take a saliva test before they leave Charlottesville. The university has asked that once students have left they not return to the Charlottesville area until classes for the spring semester begin Feb. 1. UVa has about 4,500 on-campus students and 13,500 off-campus. UVa also will offer voluntary testing to academic division faculty and staff, contracted workers, and Medical Center and University Physicians group team members. President Jim Ryan thanked students for generally following COVID-19 regulations. \u201cAside from a few unfortunate lapses, you did what you had to do to stay safe,\u201d he said in a video statement. \u201cYou looked out for one another. You dealt with testing, isolation and Zoom fatigue.\u201d Dr. Meredith Hayden, associate executive director of student health and wellness at UVa, recommended students minimize contact with people for 14 days after leaving college. She also advised students to get a flu shot and to be mindful of grandparents and older family members. In recent weeks, colleges have reported fewer positive cases. There have been more than 5,000 cases at Virginia colleges since the pandemic began, but the majority of them occurred in August and September. In mid-September, Virginia Tech reported a seven-day positivity rate of 19%. Since mid-October, that figure has remained under 4%. Virginia Tech has conducted more tests than most universities across the state, having administered 37,000 tests since Aug. 3. According to Dr. Noelle Bissell, health director for the New River Valley, college students are not driving virus transmission in Southwest Virginia. Working adults ages 25 to 59, however, have contributed to rising cases in that part of the state because of social and work gatherings, household spread, church events and carpooling, Bissell said. \u201cWe know how this spreads,\u201d she said. \u201cIt spreads from that close social contact.\u201d Shushok, at Virginia Tech, said he was afraid students would tire of wearing masks and avoiding social functions, but that never happened. \u201cOur students stayed committed the entire time,\u201d he said. Dr. Danny Avula, health director in Henrico County and Richmond, said college students didn\u2019t appear to be driving cases in the Richmond area either. While the 20- to 40-year-old age groups have represented a larger portion of positive cases recently, college students don\u2019t seem to be the cause, he said. During the week of Aug. 27, VCU reported 82 new student cases \u2014 its worst week of the semester. The week of Nov. 9, it reported 22 new student cases. VCU has conducted about 9,800 tests.","273":"Today, President-Elect Joe Biden is scheduled to release the first of his Cabinet choices. A handful of names already have been announced, but Mr. Biden said on Nov. 22 that he would start rolling out more selections as of Nov. 24. Last week, New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof named Mr. Ryan as his suggested pick for heading the U.S. Department of Education. The Washington Post, meanwhile, cites Rep. Donna Shalala; Rep. Jahana Hayes; Lily Garcia, former head of the National Education Association; and Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, as occupying Mr. Biden\u2019s short list for the education post. Another oft-mentioned named is that of Linda Darling-Hammond, education professor emeritus at Stanford University and president and CEO of the Learning Policy Institute. Playing guessing games about an incoming Cabinet is always an entertaining exercise for those who enjoy politics. And that can lead to a flood of speculation, as pundits, politicians and others float the names of their favorites \u2014 as Larry J. Sabato, professor and founder of the UVa Center for Politics and head of Sabato\u2019s Crystal Ball, has observed. \u201cWe used to joke that \u2018The Great Mentioner\u2019 created every list of Cabinet nominees, but in all these years, I\u2019ve never found him or her,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not a bad thing to be mentioned. It\u2019s a compliment, in fact.\u201d It is a compliment. Let us add our congratulations to those heading Mr. Ryan\u2019s way. Amid all the pre-announcement conjecture, Mr. Ryan was considered to be in the middle of the pack among those whose names were mentioned for education secretary. For his part, the UVa president said he was content where he is. \u201cI was surprised and flattered by the mention,\u201d he said. \u201cBut my focus has been and will continue to be leading the University of Virginia, a place that I love, as we navigate the pandemic and the many challenges it has created for our community.\u201d Other members of the local community were both pleased and perturbed that Mr. Ryan might be tapped for a new job. Again, the odds of that happening are not solid. Many names have been tossed around for education secretary and other Cabinet posts. We\u2019ll soon find out if the speculation around Mr. Ryan\u2019s name was more than simply that. \u201c\u2026[I]t\u2019s a favorite Washington parlor game to construct the lists,\u201d Mr. Sabato reminds us. It also was an agreeable distraction from the gloom of COVID, giving the community a pleasant and positive piece of news on which to focus. For that, we\u2019re thankful.","274":"Letters of thanks, drawings and snacks have poured into the COVID-19 unit at the University of Virginia Medical Center since the start of the pandemic locally. The COVID-19 unit, officially known as the Special Pathogens Unit, opened April 2 in the new hospital tower and has since taken over a few floors. Visitors are restricted on the unit except for in end-of-life situations, so the notes and drawings have been a way for the community to show its appreciation of those on the front lines of the pandemic. \u201cIt\u2019s very encouraging to the staff to see these little things when they come in,\u201d said Cheryl Martin, the health unit coordinator. \u201c... It\u2019s so much of an encouragement to the nurses because they get really fatigued.\u201d Martin has worked during her weekend shifts to try to keep track of the cards, drawings and other donations over the last eight months. At first, she said, they tried to write thank you notes for those who gave food and other items. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t keep up with it,\u201d Martin said. \u201cIt was just too much. When you\u2019re on the COVID unit, it\u2019s just nonstop the whole day long.\u201d Eventually, they started sending a photo of the food or donated items to the person or group to confirm they received the goods. Martin said she wanted to share the notes and highlight the community\u2019s contributions as a way to say thank you to everyone who has helped the unit. \u201cWe do appreciate everything,\u201d she said. \u201c... The community has thanked us, but we need to thank them too. It\u2019s like hand in hand.\u201d To keep the medical staff energized, Martin said Grit Coffee has provided coffee weekly to the unit, which they keep in the freezer until it\u2019s needed. \u201cIf they didn\u2019t send the coffee, we wouldn\u2019t have coffee unless a staff member brings it in and we all share it, but it disappears so quick,\u201d she said. \u201cGrit Coffee has stood with us from day one.\u201d Martin has kept the drawings from area children and cards sent to the unit\u2019s staff. The stack, compiled over the last several months, includes a rendering of an angry coronavirus; a simple \u201cThank You for Fixing People\u201d written on a white sheet of paper accompanied by a smiling face and two elongated hearts; and a rainbow fish on yellow construction paper encouraging the staff to \u201cjust keep swimming\u201d and that \u201cyou can do this.\u201d Throughout the stack, there\u2019s a theme. The nurses, doctors and hospital staff who showed up to care for COVID patients are brave and working hard to keep the community safe. \u201cYou are a hero, doctors and nurses,\u201d one multi-colored note written in crayon read. Other cards came from families who had loved ones in the unit. They thanked the staff for their life-saving work and shared updates about those who were then recovering at home. Families of COVID-19 patients also sent food, which Martin found mind-boggling. \u201cAll we\u2019re doing is talking with them by telephone, but they\u2019re so appreciative,\u201d she said. Other community groups and businesses have provided food for the unit, along with notes of encouragement. Girl Scouts dropped off boxes and boxes of cookies. Auntie Anne\u2019s, Victory Church, Farmington Country Church, Common House and others provided meals to keep the staff fed, Martin said. During her shifts, she would get the calls from downstairs that a food delivery had arrived and then bring it up to the SPU staff. \u201cBoy, when food shows up, it\u2019s just such a magnet for the nurses when they do get a minute to take a break, which is very rare,\u201d she said. \u201cThey just appreciate it.\u201d The Table Church sent meals every Friday for three months, she said. Another church sent homemade cookies in the shape of a doctor\u2019s body with a stethoscope. \u201cIt\u2019s just been so much support,\u201d Martin said. \u201c... The community, they\u2019ve been there. When these little notes come in, it\u2019s just amazing. It does so much, and we appreciate people being there and thinking of us.\u201d","275":"If Albemarle County\u2019s COVID-19 case numbers move into the \u201chigher\u201d or \u201chighest\u201d risk categories, as determined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the school division would return to all-virtual classes. The division announced the thresholds Tuesday, the last day of classes before the Thanksgiving holiday. Over the last several months, teachers and community members have been requesting clear benchmarks for each stage of the division\u2019s reopening plan. This week\u2019s announcement to staff and families follows reports of rising COVID-19 cases nationally and fears that gatherings during the Thanksgiving holiday will exacerbate the spread the virus. In-person classes for lower-grade Albemarle students started earlier this month. The Charlottesville school division is planning for in-person classes to start in January, but officials have not set thresholds for what would trigger a return to all-virtual classes. City schools Superintendent Rosa Atkins said she\u2019ll bring a matrix of different metrics to the School Board\u2019s Dec. 2 meeting for members to consider. In Albemarle, the thresholds focus on two of the CDC\u2019s core indicators: the number of new cases per 100,000 residents over the last 14 days and the percent of positive tests over the last 14 days. The third core indicator is the ability of a school system to implement a range of mitigation measures such as mask wearing and social distancing. The division will move to Stage One \u2014 online-only classes \u2014 if the first indicator is above 200 new cases for seven consecutive dates and if the positivity rate is above 8%. If necessary to return to Stage One, the division said it will notify School Board members, employees and families immediately, and the transition would occur at the beginning of the following week. The Albemarle Education Association, which represents county teachers, criticized the thresholds in a statement Tuesday, saying it would like to see them revised to include numbers in lower risk categories. A shift to Stage One doesn\u2019t require School Board approval. The division said it will go back to Stage Three when both measures decrease for 14 days and at least one measure is below the threshold. The CDC considers a rate of more than 200 cases to be in the highest risk category for COVID-19 transmission, according to its list of indicators and metrics that gauge risk levels for schools based on COVID-19 numbers for lowest to highest. The higher and highest risk categories are color-coded in orange and red, specifically. A positivity rate of 8% would fall under the higher risk category. At the highest risk level, school leaders should limit in-person instruction to only students with disabilities, the Virginia Department of Health has said in its guidance to schools. As of Tuesday, the county had recorded 146.2 new cases per 100,000 residents, a metric that has steadily ticked up in the last week and is in the CDC\u2019s higher risk category. The positivity rate, however, was 1.4%, which is in the lowest risk category. The county has never had more than 200 cases per 100,000 since the pandemic started in March, and the positivity rate has been in the lowest risk category \u2014 below 3% \u2014 since Oct. 17. Charlottesville\u2019s case rate hasn\u2019t dropped below 200 since Aug. 29, though its positivity rate has remained low. Positivity rates in the Thomas Jefferson Health District, as well as in Albemarle and Charlottesville specifically, have dropped significantly as the University of Virginia ramped up testing over the last two months. Public health officials have said UVa-affiliated testing has skewed the percent of positive tests reported over a seven-day timeframe. From Nov. 15 to Nov. 21, 71% of all testing encounters in the health district were either for UVa students, faculty, staff or contract workers, according to a Daily Progress analysis of area testing data. The health district is not recommending that the school divisions set those testing benchmarks but does support them, spokeswoman Kathryn Goodman said. She said the data points are subject to the broader community and affected by UVa for Charlottesville and Albemarle. Goodman said additional factors are needed to understand that data such as virus transmission in the schools. Surrounding counties in the district could rely on the CDC indicators because the university doesn\u2019t influence their data as much, she said. Rosalyn Schmitt, the Albemarle division\u2019s chief operating officer, said in her announcement about the thresholds that they\u2019ll be in place while UVa students are gone for the holidays, beginning this week. After UVa students return in February for spring classes, division staff will analyze the impact on their return on the thresholds. \u201cThresholds must take into account circumstances that could influence our data, but not pose a risk to our schools,\u201d Schmitt said. \u201cFor example, a large outbreak at a long-term care facility may result in data exceeding a benchmark, but it would not require the school division to return to Stage One.\u201d She added that factors such as higher absentee rates of students and staff or evidence of the virus spreading in facilities could result in a return to Stage One even if thresholds have not been reached. \u201cThresholds are intended for division-wide decisions,\u201d Schmitt said. \u201cShort-term decisions made by individual schools may occur separately if circumstances warrant and in consultation with the local health department.\u201d Division spokesman Phil Giaramita said Wednesday that officials pulled from the CDC\u2019s higher risk category, as opposed to highest risk, for the positivity percentage in part because of the possibility of UVA testing strategies influencing the county\u2019s rate. More than 10% of positive tests returned over 14 days would fall in the highest risk category. In September, the Albemarle Education Association proposed benchmarks for each reopening stage based on information from Harvard\u2019s Global Health Institute, federal guidance and other analysis. Neither division leadership nor the School Board publicly discussed that proposal. On Tuesday, AEA\u2019s leadership criticized the thresholds and the exclusion of Charlottesville\u2019s data in the schools and said teachers weren\u2019t consulted prior to the public release of the benchmarks. \u201cWhile the AEA is pleased that the administration finally has acknowledged that measurable health data should guide reopening, it believes the benchmarks set by ACPS place students, staff and families at risk,\u201d they said in a statement to The Daily Progress that also was sent to the School Board. They would like to see the thresholds revised to include numbers from the lower risk categories set by the CDC, as well as nixing the requirement for the 14-day case incidence rate to be above 200 for seven consecutive days. That requirement, the AEA said in the statement, would mean that it will take three weeks of sustained widespread COVID transmission for the division to react. Echoing other officials, the teachers said in the statement that because of UVa\u2019s testing, AEA doesn\u2019t believe the percent positivity is an accurate reflection of the virus\u2019 threat to the greater Albemarle community. \u201cIf the cumulative case number is high, a low percent positivity does not mean that the COVID-19 risk is low,\u201d they said. Stage Three started Nov. 9, which means that preschoolers through third-graders can attend in-person classes twice a week. About half of the eligible students opted for that hybrid model. More student groups also can come into school buildings for help with online classes. Among those working or learning in-person, two students, 17 staff members and four contractors had tested positive for COVID-19 as of Tuesday, according to the division\u2019s dashboard of cases. However, there\u2019s no evidence of COVID-19 transmission in any of the schools or departments, Schmitt said in her message. No outbreaks have been reported in K-12 schools throughout the Thomas Jefferson Health District. Planning efforts for Stage Four, in which all students would have the option of in-person classes, are under way. The School Board will hear a presentation about what all that stage entails Dec. 10, with a decision on whether to move to Stage Four expected in January. The School Board and division leaders have said the decision to move up a stage will be based on several factors, including state and federal guidance, current COVID-19 conditions in the area, ability to staff the schools and the district\u2019s testing capacity. Charlottesville\u2019s plans Charlottesville City Schools is planning for in-person classes to start in January. Last week, the School Board discussed that plan, as well as potentially setting metrics for going back to all-virtual classes. However, officials said during that meeting that they didn\u2019t want to tie themselves to one metric and would consider a range of data points in determining whether to stop in-person classes. Atkins said at the meeting that when the positivity rate and case numbers go into the red, as determined by the CDC, they\u2019ll work with the local health department and the School Board on next steps. They\u2019ll also look at if there\u2019s an outbreak in the schools and where any virus spread is occurring in buildings. \u201cThat may also cause us to come back and ask the board, \u2018let\u2019s go back,\u2019\u201d Atkins said. \u201cSo it is situational. We will use the metrics, but we will also use situations to help guide us.\u201d Kim Powell, the division\u2019s assistant superintendent for finance and operations, said that in other school divisions, they\u2019ve used contact tracing on positive cases to determine the source of virus transmission and whether the virus was spreading in the schools. \u201cThat seems to drive the decision across the state with whether or not they are advised to revert to virtual learning for a classroom, for school, or for district,\u201d she said. As of Tuesday, Charlottesville had 259.8 new cases per 100,000 residents over the last 14 days, and the positivity rate was 1.1%. Board members asked about having the COVID-19 advisory committee recommend thresholds for stopping in-person classes. Board Chairwoman Jennifer McKeever said that would be a challenge for a 50-member committee, which discussed the issue at length. \u201cThere are very significant variables,\u201d she said. \u201cEven now, you look at our percent positivity rate, and as soon as we do that, we get an email from somebody who says, \u2018well without UVa, this is what our numbers look like.\u2019\u201d Board member LaShundra Bryson Morsberger and others said they want to see clear thresholds in the division\u2019s plans. Richard Feero, a parent and Abundant Life Ministries volunteer, asked the board to base its decision on local numbers and to determine the threshold for returning to all-virtual classes. \u201cWhatever the threshold is, please make it clear and official so that families with students benefiting from in-person school can better plan for a potential transition to virtual instruction if rates rise locally,\u201d Feero said.","276":"It would be nearly impossible to quantify the number of shortened vacations, missed birthdays, holidays worked, 12-hour work days, weekend shifts and foregone time with friends our newsroom staffers have racked up over the years.

Abigail Spanberger, D-7th, have moved to the forefront of a bipartisan push for Congress to deliver emergency relief to Americans struggling to survive the intensifying COVID-19 public health crisis. Warner and Spanberger helped fashion a $908 billion framework for emergency COVID-19 relief unveiled Tuesday by a coalition of centrist lawmakers from both political parties and chambers of Congress. The proponents say it\u2019s essential to help people, businesses and governments survive until new vaccines are widely distributed to bring the coronavirus pandemic under control. \u201cIt would be stupidity on steroids if Congress left for Christmas without doing an interim package as a bridge,\u201d Warner said during a news conference at the U.S. Capitol that was led by Sens. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Susan Collins, R-Maine. The kickoff included Spanberger and other members of the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus in the House of Representatives. The proposed package does not include individual stimulus checks, like the CARES Act Congress passed in March, but it would provide $180 billion for an additional $300 in weekly unemployment benefits over 18 weeks for people who have lost their jobs during the pandemic. It would provide $288 billion in potentially forgivable loans to small businesses that keep their employees on payroll through hard times. It also would provide: $12 billion for community and minority lending institutions critical to bolstering Black-owned and other minority-owned businesses, as Warner had sought in legislation he introduced earlier this year; $82 billion for K-12 schools and higher education institutions struggling to carry out their missions; and $45 billion for public transportation companies, such as the Washington Metro system, which faces a projected half-billion-dollar budget shortfall that could make life much harder for workers in the Northern Virginia suburbs. Spanberger, a centrist Democrat re-elected last month in a traditionally Republican House district, said success depends on negotiating a package that can win votes from all points on the political spectrum, unlike previous stimulus packages that failed because they did too much or too little to move through Congress. \u201cIt\u2019s not from the middle or one side or another,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s about the willingness that we have to work together. If it doesn\u2019t have the votes to get to the president\u2019s desk, it is nothing.\u201d Supporters said House Democratic and Senate Republican leaders, who control majorities in their chambers, haven\u2019t made any commitments to bringing legislation based on the framework up for votes this month. Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, a former Republican presidential candidate who has sometimes bucked President Donald Trump, said, \u201cI don\u2019t have any prediction how the White House will react.\u201d However, Romney said the pandemic requires Congress and the White House to push aside differences, including concerns he shares about increasing the nation\u2019s budget deficit, to deal with a public health emergency that is devastating families, businesses and the American economy. \u201cCOVID has created a crisis, and in a crisis, the people expect Congress to act,\u201d he said. Congress adopted and Trump signed four emergency relief packages totaling about $3 trillion in the first months of the pandemic, but efforts to provide more help have faltered. House Democrats adopted the $3 trillion HEROES Act in May, which went nowhere with Senate Republicans, who instead proposed a $500 billion relief bill that also failed. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat, and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin were negotiating a package ranging from $1.4 trillion to $1.8 trillion earlier in the fall that fell apart before the election, which shook up the dynamics of deal-making in Congress. Trump lost to Democrat Joe Biden by more than 6 million popular votes, although the president has not conceded, and Democrats lost 14 seats in the House, with their last hope of controlling the Senate resting on two runoff races in Georgia next month. \u201cPeople wanted Trump out, but they didn\u2019t want Democrats in control,\u201d said Larry Sabato, president of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia. \u201cIf that isn\u2019t clear now, they just haven\u2019t kept up with the election results.\u201d \u201cThis kind of compromise is probably the only thing that can get through,\u201d Sabato said in an interview on Tuesday. Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., called the proposed framework \u201cpromising\u201d during a press briefing on Tuesday, but acknowledged, \u201cI wished the package was larger.\u201d \u201cThe bottom line is we\u2019ve got to get a deal through the Democratic House and the Republican Senate, and that means everybody\u2019s got to give,\u201d Kaine said. Rep. Donald McEachin, D-4th, said he would reserve judgment until he digests the details of the proposed framework, but he warned that he \u201cwon\u2019t support it\u201d if it includes immunity for businesses from liability related to COVID-19, as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has insisted upon. The proposed framework would suspend liability litigation over COVID-19 precautions for six months, which Romney said would give states \u201cenough time to put in place their own protections.\u201d Money for governments The package also would provide $160 billion to state, local and tribal governments, which Senate Republicans previously have opposed. The CARES Act, passed in March, included $150 billion for state and local governments\u2014about $1.5 billion in Virginia\u2014but imposed tight controls on how they could spend it. The CARES Act also set a deadline of Dec. 30 that state and local governments say will prevent them from using the money to pay for distribution of vaccines that won\u2019t be widely available until next year. Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring joined almost 50 attorneys general from other states and U.S. territories in a letter to congressional leaders on Monday that asked them to extend the deadline for spending CARES Act funding through the end of next year. The package unveiled on Tuesday also would depend on about $560 million in money \u201crepurposed\u201d from the CARES Act and $348 million in new spending. Spending priorities include: health care providers ($35 billion); distribution of vaccines, testing and contact tracing for COVID-19 ($16 billion); rental and housing assistance ($25 billion); food and agricultural supports ($26 billion); child care ($10 billion); expanded broadband telecommunications ($10 billion); and money for the U.S. Postal Service, student loans and programs for treating people with opioid addiction. \u201cThis is not a large stimulus package,\u201d Spanberger said. \u201cIn fact, it\u2019s clear we need to do more in the future.\u201d But she and other congressional supporters say Americans can\u2019t wait for a bigger or better deal as Biden prepares to take office next month. \u201cWe\u2019re hearing from members across the spectrum that they want to get something done before we go home\u201d for the Christmas holiday, said Rep. Josh Gottheimer, a New Jersey Democrat and co-chairman of the Problem Solvers Caucus. Sabato, at UVA, said the public has reached the limit of its patience. \u201cPeople are furious,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are furious that politicians across the spectrum can\u2019t get together and help people. They\u2019re desperate.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s time to move.\u201d","279":"Federal officials are pushing those most likely to come into contact with COVID and those most likely to die or suffer from it to the front of the line for the vaccines, one of which is expected to be made available this month. On Tuesday, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control\u2019s advisory committee on immunization practices voted 13-1 to provide the first vaccines for healthcare workers and those in long-term care facilities. The committee cited COVID\u2019s impact on healthcare workers and those living in long-term care facilities in setting the priorities. They will set other priorities in the population as more vaccines become available. The CDC expects 40 million doses of the vaccine in the next few weeks, enough to inoculate about 20 million health workers with a two-part dose. Officials then expect the doses to start trickling in by the millions every week to health departments and hospitals across the country. Locally, the distribution will fall primarily to the Thomas Jefferson Health District, which distributes most influenza and other vaccinations. \u201cWe have plans already in place because we are responsible for providing points of dispensing for vaccines and distribution of antibiotics and other drugs in case of emergencies,\u201d said Jessica Coughlin, emergency manager for the health district. She also manages the districts COVID-19 testing programs as well as the mass vaccination program. \u201cWe don\u2019t know exactly what the priority groups are going to be or when the vaccines are going to be available to the general public,\u201d Coughlin said. \u201cLike everything that\u2019s happened with the pandemic, we\u2019re ready with our plans but we\u2019re also ready in case our plans have to be changed.\u201d University of Virginia Health officials are in a similar plan now, revise later mode. \u201cThere has been a lot of discussion at the federal level about how to distribute it to the population and we know there will be a point where supplies are simply outstripped by the demand, especially early in the distribution process,\u201d said Dr. Costi Sifri, director of hospital epidemiology at the University of Virginia Medical Center. \u201cIt\u2019s a logistical challenge and we\u2019ve had many of those with the pandemic,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a significant challenge, but it\u2019s a hopeful challenge compared to so many of the others.\u201d Sifri said current information indicates a vaccine could be available this month. Other vaccines, he said, are likely to follow. \u201cWe\u2019ve heard there will be some ready to distribute in a few weeks,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re hopeful that we\u2019ll see multiple, different vaccines become available so that the availability improves as the year goes on. That would allow you to choose which vaccine is best for which individual.\u201d \u201cAllocation of COVID-19 vaccine should maximize the benefits of vaccination to both individual recipients and the population overall,\u201d CDC officials said in their planning documents for vaccine delivery. \u201cIdentification of groups whose receipt of the vaccine would lead to the greatest benefit should be based on scientific evidence, accounting for those at highest risk for infection or severe COVID-19\u2013related disease or death, and the essential role of certain workers.\u201d The CDC has recommended that the second round of vaccines be given to essential workers, including those in meat packing plants, truck drivers and grocery store workers, and those with health risks followed by adults over 65. Those recommendations have not been formalized. CDC officials said the vaccines will be distributed to the states through channels similar to current influenza and other vaccines. The states will deliver them to hospitals, health departments, doctors and other providers as they come in. \u201cThe vaccine supply is projected to increase quickly over the proceeding months, allowing vaccination efforts to be expanded to additional critical populations and the general public,\u201d the CDC planning document states. Sifri said UVa Health will first distribute its supply of vaccine to those nurses, doctors and staff who work on the COVID wards first, followed by other health care workers and those at highest risk if they contract COVID-19. The Thomas Jefferson Health District, which serves the region, will be responsible for administering the vaccine to the general population. Coughlin said vaccination events will likely resemble the health district\u2019s drive-up testing programs. The drive-in program provides easy social distancing by keeping people not living in the same household a car-length apart. \u201cThe biggest change we\u2019ve seen has been the way we do testing by using a drive-through program rather than the traditional method of providing vaccinations in school buildings or public buildings,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve now got a good feel for how it would work.\u201d Currently there is one COVID-19 vaccine approved for emergency use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Another vaccine was submitted on Nov. 30 for FDA review for emergency approval. Medical officials say they are concerned that many residents will doubt the safety of the vaccines, either because of how quickly they were developed or because they mistrust the medical community itself. \u201cThere are people at high risk for complications of COVID and there are concerns that there may be some vaccine reluctance,\u201d Sifri said. \u201cWe need the right communications so that people trust the vaccines.\u201d The vaccines must go through three trial phases before the FDA will consider them for distribution. The first phase determines if the drug is safe. The second shows whether it works. The third assesses how effective it is. Normally, the process can take years, but with the pandemic firmly in place, the FDA approved and the federal government funded efforts by drug companies and researchers to step up development of vaccines under emergency use authorizations. That specifically allows vaccines and treatments during public health emergencies when there are no adequate, approved, and available alternatives. Although the vaccines are moved through the process at a much faster rate than normal, they must still go through and pass all three phases of study and FDA review. The CDC estimates 60 vaccines are being tested on humans and another 90 are in tests on animals. One has been granted emergency use authorization and another is being considered for emergency use. Sifri said UVa Health officials are preparing for the arrival of vaccines, knowing that each one approved will likely have different storage needs and protocols. That in itself is an issue as the emergency approval has been given to a vaccine created by drug company Pfizer that requires storage at -94 degrees Fahrenheit. A vaccine under review by the FDA created by drug company Moderna requires its product to be stored at -4 degrees Fahrenheit. \u201cWe\u2019re challenged by the fact that we don\u2019t know which vaccine or what type we will get or what vaccines will become available later on or how those will need to be handled and administered. It\u2019s like skating after a moving puck,\u201d he said. Coughlin said that health officials will do their best to track those who receive the vaccine but that it\u2019s important for those who receive the shot to be sure they receive the second dose. \u201cOnce the program is running and we have vaccines coming in, it will be important for people to keep their paperwork, know when they need to come in for the second dose and follow-up themselves,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re planning on being ready with plans from A to Z because we know we\u2019ll need more than just plan A and plan B,\u201d she said. \u201cOnce the vaccines are here, we know things are going to change and we will react with whatever changes we need to make.\u201d","280":"Virginia Commonwealth University Health System will outsource its billing and collection department, transferring those functions to financial services company Ensemble Health Partners. In October, Ensemble announced that it would take over VCU Health\u2019s revenue cycle operations, which include collecting account balances, administering payments and conducting other financial work. As a result, VCU Health is eliminating the jobs of 635 employees, but 577 of them were hired by Ensemble, said Mary Kate Brogan, a VCU Heath spokeswoman. Of the 635 affected employees, some chose to retire or seek employment elsewhere. All employees who sought employment with Ensemble were offered a position, said Kendall Herold, spokesman for Ensemble. The employees hired by Ensemble will start Dec. 20. VCU\u2019s decision to outsource its revenue cycle operations doesn\u2019t stem from the pandemic, Brogan said. \u201cThe decision to outsource our revenue cycle services is not the result of the financial impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic,\u201d Brogan said. \u201cOur work to improve our patient experience through every point in the care process is ongoing. We began exploring options for how to best manage our scheduling, billing and collections practices to meet industry best practices over a year ago.\u201d Ensemble, based in Cincinnati, has more than 30 clients and more than 380 facilities across the United States, according to its website. VCU Health announced in March that it would cease the practice of seizing patients\u2019 wages and placing liens on their homes in order to collect back payments. \u201cHealth care needs to be more affordable for patients, and we want to be part of the solution,\u201d Melinda Hancock, VCU Health\u2019s chief administrative and financial officer, said at the time. The decision came after an investigation by Kaiser Health News, which reported that VCU Health and UVA Health aggressively pursued patients who were unable to pay their bills, sending many of them into bankruptcy.","281":"Wastewater surveillance is now being used in the Charlottesville area to help forecast surges in COVID-19 cases. The samples, combined with other data, are part of an epidemiologic model project at the University of Virginia. Ultimately, the data will be shared with public health officials, hospitals, the Virginia Department of Heath and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s National Wastewater Surveillance System. \u201cThe long-term goal is to combine as many data inputs as we can, and have them synergize with one another to more accurately predict what\u2019s going to happen in the next couple of weeks,\u201d said Brent French, a professor of biomedical engineering at UVa. Heman Shakeri, an assistant professor in UVa\u2019s School of Data Science; Michael D. Porter, an associate professor of systems engineering; and French are leading the project, which received funding from the Ivy Foundation\u2019s COVID-19 Translational Research Fund. French said the initial motivation for the project was when the hospital system rescheduled elective surgeries and clinic visits in the spring in anticipation of having a flood of COVID-19 patients, resulting in furloughs for some medical staffers. In Virginia, wastewater surveillance also is being done in Hampton Roads. The project team is sampling wastewater at five sites in the city and Albemarle County, covering most of the Charlottesville area. The sites were selected using GIS data to determine the most logical points to sample with the resources available. \u201cThe biggest constraint is the cost of the auto-samplers, which are about $5,000 apiece, and there\u2019s also a manpower limitation because it takes a village to actually make this happen and somebody has to pay those paychecks,\u201d French said. UVa Facilities Management staff members are going out to the sites, opening the manhole covers and setting up the auto-samplers. Paul Zmick, the senior associate director for energy and utilities, said he\u2019s working with the Rivanna Water & Sewer Authority, the city and the Albemarle County Service Authority on access to the system, and that they\u2019ll get a preliminary update by the end of this year. Other entities had offered to do wastewater surveillance in the area, he said. \u201cI recommended that they let us do it, because we\u2019re doing it [at UVa] and we have funding, so that wouldn\u2019t cost them anything for the community to learn this,\u201d Zmick said. \u201cThe results will be shared once we understand what we\u2019re looking at. We\u2019re very early on.\u201d Zmick and French said the auto-samplers were delayed in getting here and they weren\u2019t able to start taking samples until November. \u201cWe\u2019ve had relatively low case counts ever since we began sampling,\u201d French said. \u201cIt\u2019s currently beneath our detectable limits.\u201d Monitoring wastewater is already being done at dormitories and other buildings at UVa, and the UVa Biocomplexity Institute has been working with the state to provide epidemiological modeling based on case counts from VDH. French said the groups\u2019 project fits in with these ongoing efforts and is intended to complement them rather than compete with them. \u201cWhere we see the value in the wastewater surveillance in a post-surge period, during a calm time ... the wastewater surveillance would be a good way to detect an unanticipated resurgence and even to zero in on what part of the city that resurgence is occurring,\u201d he said. In addition to wastewater surveillance, the model also will use data scraped from the internet, including social media, to monitor public compliance with social distancing measures. The CDC is developing a portal for health officials across the country to submit wastewater testing data, which will be used to create a national database. \u201cOur team\u2019s primary goal is simply to implement the CDC program here in [Charlottesville] the best we can given the resources available to us,\u201d French said.","282":"With warnings of a possible holiday surge of COVID-19 cases and many hospitals and health systems across the country overwhelmed with patients, University of Virginia Health System officials are preparing for the worst and hoping for the best. Officials are advising doctors, nurses and hospital staff that sudden changes in schedules and assignments could occur if the virus strikes hard at Central Virginia. They\u2019ve also built up stores of protective gear in the past six months and are now preparing to give vaccine shots to those working in the COVID wards and those who are high-risk. The first of the vaccines are expected to arrive within a week. Appointments for staff members to get their shots are now being made. \u201cWe\u2019re feeling well prepared, as prepared as we can be,\u201d said Wendy Horton, UVa Medical Center chief executive officer. \u201cWe\u2019re not seeing a surge, but our COVID numbers are ticking upward and we\u2019re looking at what we need to do and adjust so we have as many options to us as possible.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve learned a lot locally and around the world about patients\u2019 needs and how to treat them, what works and what doesn\u2019t,\u201d said Dr. Reid Adams, chief medical officer at the medical center. \u201cIf our numbers aren\u2019t doubling every day or week, we\u2019re able to redirect and move staff around to handle COVID patients. If we see increases, we can move staff trained to treat COVID patients but we will still need to staff those non-COVID wards. If a surge hits, we may have to delay some procedures.\u201d Last week, U.S. Centers for Disease Control officials, using nearly two dozen forecasting models, predicted more than a million new COVID cases could be diagnosed across the country between Thanksgiving and Dec. 15. Reid said UVa COVID unit beds will available to Central Virginians. If the beds are not filled by locals and the hospital has capacity, it will offer beds to patients in other Virginia communities that are struggling to provide care, much as it did this spring. \u201cWe try to help out anybody we can, but if our own numbers get higher it makes it harder to help,\u201d Reid said. \u201cWe have to look at it day-to-day. We are a local hospital and we take care of those in area first, if we can.\u201d Reid said the region has been lucky in that cases have remained low and the hospital system has not been slammed by a large number of patients in a small amount of time. \u201cOne of the struggles everyone has had is staffing and we\u2019ve been lucky that we haven\u2019t had the same situation as they\u2019re having in Texas, Wisconsin and Michigan,\u201d he said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t been in a situation where we wear our staff out and we don\u2019t want to be in that situation.\u201d The CDC predictions are best estimates combined with educated guesswork. They\u2019re used by health districts and medical officials to create worst-case scenarios and prepare for them. \u201cWe are continuously evaluating our processes and services to meet the demands of the COVID-19 pandemic and, lately, the increase in cases,\u201d said Kathryn Goodman, spokeswoman for the Thomas Jefferson Health District, which includes Charlottesville and Albemarle, Greene, Fluvanna, Louisa and Nelson counties. The health district provides COVID testing, collects statistics, does contact tracing and will administer vaccines when they are ready for the public. \u201cWe are working to alter staff job duties and assignments and overtime as needed. We will make changes to our services and adjust schedules accordingly for COVID-19 testing and vaccination purposes,\u201d Goodman said. \u201cWe are working on plans to ensure we have adequate staffing and support in place for when it\u2019s time to distribute COVID-19 vaccines.\u201d UVa Medical Center will follow CDC guidelines approved last week to provide vaccines first to medical staff treating COVID patients and then to people at risk of severe illness or death should they contract the virus. Officials for Sentara Healthcare, which owns Sentara Martha Jefferson Hospital in Albemarle County, said they will also follow the CDC guidelines. \u201cVaccine distribution will include emergency department staff, ICU\u2019s, COVID patient units, respiratory unit staff, cleaning and food service employees who interact with patients, and others,\u201d Sentara officials said in a statement. \u201cThe COVID-19 vaccine will be optional for all employees.\u201d Both Sentara Martha Jefferson Hospital and UVa Medical Center routinely provide vaccinations for employees and will use the current organizational structure to get the shots into employees\u2019 arms. \u201cWe\u2019re starting with high-risk caregivers for COVID patients and we\u2019re making sure to get all of the healthcare team members who work with those patients,\u201d Horton said. Horton said that as vaccine supplies roll in, the medical center will expand vaccinations to other healthcare workers and persons at risk. Personal protective equipment, known as PPE, proved hard to come by in the early days of the pandemic but officials at both hospitals say they have stocked up on the gear and found ways to treat patients without using as much gear. \u201cBefore the COVID-19 pandemic, normal PPE usage among isolated patients amounted to 27 pieces of PPE per patient, per day,\u201d Sentara officials said. \u201cThis rate of consumption was unsustainable due to supply chain uncertainties.\u201d With new protocols that limit the number of staff entering and exiting patient rooms and using one staff member to perform several procedures during one visit, Sentara officials said only six pieces of PPE are used per patient, per day. Similar efforts have been made across the country and at UVa. \u201cWe\u2019ve built up our supplies of PPE in case of a surge to guarantee we\u2019ll have supplies,\u201d Horton said. \u201cWe\u2019re making sure we have the right equipment and adequate numbers.\u201d Kroger Health, the grocery chain\u2019s healthcare division, announced Tuesday that it is offering COVID testing through its pharmacies, using rapid antibody tests. The tests show if a patient has been previously infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes the COVID-19 disease. Approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the tests involve a finger-prick blood sample, much like devices used to test blood sugar levels. The tests sell for $25 and usually provide results within 15 minutes. Individuals who believe they may have had COVID-19 but are not currently experiencing symptoms are eligible for the test. The tests are not used to detect an active infection, only to indicate if a person may have previously been infected. Hospital officials all said that the best way to keep beds open and COVID in control is to follow CDC guidelines in social distancing, not traveling, staying out of large groups and wearing masks. Recent studies show wearing mask protects both the wearer and those nearby by limiting the amount of virus the wearer exhales or inhales. \u201cThose are efforts that everyone can take that can make a big difference in limiting the surge and the number of people hospitalized,\u201d Horton said. \u201cIt really does make a difference.\u201d","283":"University of Virginia students can expect COVID-19 restrictions and requirements to continue when they return to Grounds from winter break, officials told the university\u2019s Board of Visitors on Friday. Administrators, faculty and students were also praised to the board and by the board for efforts at helping the university make a quick move from on-Grounds to online classes in March and for limiting the spread of COVID-19 during the fall semester. UVa President Jim Ryan told the university\u2019s Board of Visitors during a virtual meeting that the university saw an estimated 1,250 COVID cases between August and Thanksgiving. He said seven staff, faculty or employees were hospitalized with virus and all fully recovered. He said no students needed hospitalization. Using saliva tests developed by the UVa School of Medicine and UVa Medical Center, the university went from testing 338 people a day in September to 1,300 a day at semester\u2019s end, including one day near the end when 2,200 people were tested. Officials said that, as of Friday, UVa had completed 35,000 COVID-19 tests. \u201cWe developed our own tests. We worked hard, often in cooperation with the [Thomas Jefferson Health Department] to do contact tracing. We developed hybrid classes that were online and in-person where no similar classes had existed,\u201d Ryan told the board. \u201cThis was truly a team effort, and a heroic effort at that, that involved thousands of students and staff.\u201d Ryan presented national statistics that showed UVa and the surrounding community had a lower positivity rate and number of cases than most communities of similar size with large universities. \u201cSome of the low results were because we were doing so much testing, but I want to point out that the rates were down here even while others were increasing,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cWe learned to stay ahead of the virus as best as possible, even if it meant increasing restrictions, which we did.\u201d Ryan and other administrators credited the university staff with developing new curricula to move college courses online as well as rethinking everything from dining halls to dormitories to provide more safety to staff and students. Staff installed nearly 56,000 safety-related signs across Grounds and put up 2,200 Plexiglas shields and a similar number of stations for hand sanitizer, officials said. \u201cThe crisis that the university and society and everyone was dealing with was unique,\u201d said UVa Provost Liz Magill. \u201cIt was like a major, constant weather event that hit in February and hasn\u2019t stopped since. It\u2019s like a hurricane that keeps going. It brought a lot of changes. It changed almost daily. It required us to do many things in different ways.\u201d UVa Rector Jim Murray said the Board of Visitors helped pave the way for success by being quick to react and give administrators needed resources. He noted that the board, which normally meets about four times a year, met a dozen times with all but one meeting online. \u201cWe approached this pandemic as a deadly problem,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we approached it with money. It will be a long time before we know how much the financial fallout will be but it\u2019s about $40 million of non-recoverable money.\u201d How the pandemic will play out in the New Year is an unknown, but Ryan said social restrictions implemented in the fall semester will be in place when students begin returning in late January to help limit the virus\u2019 spread. \u201cWe\u2019re going to continue with the protocols so students will have to comply with masking and social distancing,\u201d he told the board. \u201cWe will also increase testing so that we will test students once a week and offer testing for faculty staff and who return to Grounds to work in-person.\u201d Administrators told the Board of Visitors that the university community will be expected to adhere to the restrictions even as the weather warms in the spring and more receive vaccinations, which are scheduled to begin next week for frontline caregivers. \u201cWe\u2019ll have an uncomfortable period where people who are vaccinated will want to get on with their lives and be free of the restrictions while those who have not been vaccinated will have different guidelines,\u201d said Dr. Costi Sifri, director of hospital epidemiology at UVa Medical Center. \u201cThat will be an issue not just here but in the community, itself.\u201d Dr. Craig Kent, executive vice president for health affairs at UVa, said sticking to restrictions will be important to stymie the virus\u2019 spread. \u201cYour approach to the virus after you\u2019re vaccinated should be the same as your approach to the virus before you\u2019re vaccinated,\u201d Kent said. \u201cI think the next few weeks are going to be important to see if hospitalizations are going increase or decline.\u201d Ryan said he is confident the university will have a successful spring semester based on its fall performance. \u201cWe\u2019re well prepared for the spring because we\u2019ve been through this in March and this semester,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cIt has been an extraordinary nine months.\u201d","284":"Stories of tough times in intensive care units and the hard work of nurses, doctors and staff during the COVID-19 pandemic may be fueling an increase in applications to medical schools, including programs at the University of Virginia. Schools in Virginia and across the country are seeing increases in the numbers of students applying, according to figures released by Virginia colleges and the American Association of Medical Colleges. Officials say applications to the UVa School of Medicine increased 35% this year. The School of Nursing has seen a 27% rise in applications to its master of science in nursing program and a 23% rise in its clinical nurse leader program. The clinical nurse leader program serves as a fast-track for the master\u2019s degree program for those not currently in nursing and a leadership master\u2019s degree for those students who are currently registered nurses. \u201cNationally, applications are up about 18% and for us, it\u2019s about 35%,\u201d said Dr. Reid Adams, UVa Medical Center\u2019s chief medical officer. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a lot of informal comments about how applicants are being inspired by those on the front line of medicine during the pandemic.\u201d Adams said he has not interviewed any of the candidates and cannot say for sure what is motivating applicants. \u201cOthers have said that the pandemic has revealed how important it is and that people are now seeing the value of healthcare professionals,\u201d he said. Virginia Tech Carillion School of Medicine has seen applications go up 48%, officials said. \u201cThere are a few reasons why more people may be applying to medical school this year: the pandemic may have increased a desire to pursue medicine and give back in this time of need,\u201d said Melanie Prusakowski, associate dean of admissions at the Virginia Tech school. \u201c[Or] students may have more time to devote to medical school applications with virtual classes and employment.\u201d Virginia Commonwealth University reported an 11% increase in applications. According to the medical colleges association, nearly two dozen medical schools across the country have seen applications jump by at least 25%. In the past 10 years, the year-to-year increase has averaged less than 3%, association figures show. \u201cWe\u2019ve been experiencing a leveling off in recent years, so the large increase was quite surprising,\u201d said Gabrielle Campbell, services officer for the association. \u201cIt\u2019s also inspiring.\u201d Association officials said there are numerous reasons why more people would apply to medical schools, including a poor job market that makes medicine seem like a more secure profession and students having more time to make applications. Still, scenes of medical staff portrayed in heroic light on television and mass media have likely encouraged applicants, officials said. \u201cI make an analogy to the time after Sept. 11 when we saw an increase in those motivated to serve this country militarily,\u201d said Geoffrey Young, the organization\u2019s senior director for student affairs and programs. \u201cThis certainly seems like a significant factor this year.\u201d UVa medical schools have also seen a more than 90% rise in applications to post-master of science in nursing degree programs, much of which is in psychological\/mental health nurse practitioner programs. The nursing school has also seen a 16% rise in applications to the bachelor of science in nursing and the doctor of nursing practice program. Wendy Horton, UVa Health System\u2019s chief executive officer, said there are other jobs on the medical frontline that don\u2019t require advanced degrees but have proven to be just as important as healthcare providers. \u201cThere are a lot of opportunities in the medical center that don\u2019t require but a high school diploma and are important, such as patient transportation, nursing assistants and other positions,\u201d Horton said. \u201cA lot of them people don\u2019t know about, but they\u2019re in the middle of it working with the healthcare providers, too.\u201d","285":"A state organization has recognized two University of Virginia physicians and a Piedmont Virginia Community College English professor and writing instructor as outstanding faculty members. The State Council of Higher Education for Virginia named Dr. Taison Bell and Dr. Andrew Wolf, of UVa\u2019s Medical Center and School of Medicine, as well as PVCC\u2019s Jennifer Koster as among the dozen faculty members to win the state\u2019s highest honor for faculty at Virginia\u2019s public and private colleges and universities. Institutions submitted 72 nominees, who were then reviewed by a panel of peers and chosen by a committee of leaders from the public and private sectors. The group was first narrowed to 20 and then to 12 winners. Koster is the only winner this year from a community college, according to SCHEV. Bell has helped to lead UVa\u2019s response to the COVID-19 pandemic as medical director of the Medical Intensive Care Unit. He has cared for COVID patients in UVa\u2019s specialized units and has assisted long-term care facilities. He helped to lead an effort to create and distribute personal protective equipment to frontline care providers and has won multiple awards for his teaching. Wolf helped to develop better guidelines for cancer screenings and led the development of prostate cancer and colorectal cancer screening guidelines by the American Cancer Society. He also helped with setting screening guidelines for lung, breast and cervical cancer. \u201cDr. Wolf and Dr. Bell are incredible servants not only to their patients and students, but to the entire commonwealth of Virginia,\u201d said Dr. K. Craig Kent, UVa\u2019s executive vice president for health affairs. \u201cThey represent the incredible talent that is pervasive amongst our clinicians at UVa Health.\u201d \u201cI benefited so much from great educators that have always felt the most powerful tool I have is an ability to impart lessons to my team,\u201d Bell said in a statement. \u201cI\u2019m humbled and honored to be recognized for something that is so important to me.\u201d \u201cIt is a tremendous honor and privilege to be recognized for what brings me such great joy every day,\u201d Wolf said in a statement. \u201cI am also particularly grateful to the State Council of Higher Education for Virginia for honoring a primary care physician-educator \u2014 there are many like me on the front lines of both health care and medical education who are equally deserving of this award.\u201d An English professor and coordinator of PVCC\u2019s Writing Center, Koster is the founder of the Virginia Community College System\u2019s Learning Assistance Professionals Peer Group and coordinator of the Virginia chapter of the Southeastern Writing Center Association. This year she initiated Virginia\u2019s first statewide tutor collaboration, TuColla-VA. \u201cProfessor Koster is a talented, dedicated faculty member who is committed to providing opportunity for students. She goes the extra mile to help all students succeed. She epitomizes the quality of faculty that students encounter at PVCC,\u201d said Frank Friedman, PVCC president. \u201cI am honored to have been selected for this award,\u201d Koster said. \u201cI\u2019m lucky to work in the [state community college system] and especially at PVCC, where I\u2019ve been provided with resources to grow as a teacher and person, and with the support to undertake new ventures. I am continually inspired by my colleagues, our students and the PVCC Writing Center staff.\u201d Winners each receive a $7,500 cash award underwritten by the Dominion Foundation, as well as a commemorative engraved award.","286":"After months of caution, constraint, worry and wait, vaccine for COVID-19 has made its way to Central Virginia. Sentara Martha Jefferson Hospital received its allotment of the corporation\u2019s first 11,700 doses of vaccine Monday afternoon, about seven hours after they arrived at corporate headquarters in Norfolk. University of Virginia Medical Center officials say they expect the first doses Tuesday morning. Both organizations hope to begin with a few vaccinations Tuesday and then increase the number of employees who get the shots beginning Wednesday. Both plan to follow Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Virginia Department of Health guidelines by starting with doctors, nurses and support staff in COVID units. \u201cWe are very, very excited. We get to start working toward the herd immunity, which will take time, but it\u2019s a move in the right direction,\u201d said Mary Morin, head of Sentara\u2019s COVID-19 task force. \u201cWe\u2019ve identified our high-risk health care workers and we have 12,520 [company-wide]. Everyone in that group will get vaccinated first and we can get about 94% in the first group.\u201d At UVa, \u201cWe expect our shipment to arrive around noon Tuesday, and vaccinations are scheduled to begin mid-afternoon Tuesday,\u201d said Eric Swensen, Medical Center spokesman. The vaccine was developed and manufactured by Pfizer and is the first to be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration under emergency guidelines. A second vaccine, developed and manufactured by Moderna, is expected to be approved later this week and to ship out next week. Both vaccines require two doses. Pfizer\u2019s second dose should be given in 21 days and Moderna\u2019s second dose in 28 days, officials said. Morin said Sentara\u2019s frontline employees who miss the first-round of Pfizer vaccines will be first in line for the Moderna shots, of which the company expects to receive 20,800. Health care workers at the company\u2019s hospitals and ancillary offices will be in the second wave of vaccinations, officials said. \u201cWe\u2019ll be offering [shots] seven days a week at various times of the day to help those employees who don\u2019t just work normal hours,\u201d Morin said. \u201cWe expect the Moderna vaccine Dec. 21 and the second doze of Pfizer to come in the next few days that we\u2019ll use for the second doses in 21 days.\u201d Although the CDC has not officially recommended who should receive the vaccine first once health care and at-risk people receive theirs, pandemic planning documents indicate public safety officers \u2014 such as paramedics, police officers and firefighters \u2014 would be soon to follow, as would those in other essential occupations. The vaccine is expected to be available to the general public by early summer as manufacturing of the shots increases. \u201cThe vaccines we\u2019re getting in now, and those in January and February, will be made available for those in the first phase,\u201d Morin said. \u201cWe expect late in the first quarter or early in the second of 2021 is when the vaccine will be widely available to the public.\u201d The Thomas Jefferson Health District will be responsible for getting vaccines to the public when the time comes. That time is not now. \u201cWe have not received any vaccine yet,\u201d said Kathryn Goodman, TJHD spokeswoman. \u201cLong-term care facilities will get their vaccines directly, as they will be administered through contracts with pharmacies like CVS and Walgreens. They will likely get vaccines over the next few weeks. We are preparing for when we will receive the vaccine, which is still to be determined but in the near future.\u201d Both Sentara Martha Jefferson Hospital and the UVa Medical Center routinely provide other vaccinations for staff members and will use the current organizational structure to get the COVID inoculations into employees\u2019 arms. \u201cWe\u2019re starting with high-risk caregivers for COVID patients and we\u2019re making sure to get all of the health care team members who work with those patients,\u201d said Wendy Horton, UVa Medical Center chief executive officer. Employees at both medical institutions are not required to get the vaccine, officials said. Sentara said a survey last month indicated that more than 80% of employees are ready to get their shots. In testing on humans, both vaccines have shown near 95% effective rates, according to the FDA and CDC. \u201cIf we can get a good 80% of our health care employees vaccinated, that\u2019s well on the way to herd immunity,\u201d said Tim Jennings, vice president and chief pharmacy officer for Sentara. \u201cThis is the most efficacious vaccine that\u2019s been brought to market, and I think once employees understand that, they will want to receive it.\u201d Both Sentara and UVa officials say that employees will continue to wear personal protective gear on the job and should continue to wear face masks and practice social distancing after being vaccinated. \u201cThose are efforts that everyone can take that can make a big difference in limiting the surge and the number of people hospitalized,\u201d Horton said. \u201cIt really does make a difference.\u201d","287":"Tuesday marks the second day of vaccine shipments rolling out statewide to curb COVID-19, which has infected 288,309 people and killed 4,470 residents in Virginia. VCU Medical Center\u2019s roughly 3,800 doses will be distributed starting Wednesday for front-line health care workers and long-term care staff and residents\u2014groups prioritized by the first round of vaccinations. Hunter Holmes McGuire VA Medical Center, one of 37 veteran medical centers in the U.S., and a Bon Secours hospital in Richmond started vaccinations Tuesday morning, marking some of the first in the area to receive one of the 72,150 doses in the state\u2019s initial shipment of the Pfizer vaccine. Bon Secours said Tuesday that its five Richmond-area hospitals had received a total of 4,875 vaccine doses. UVA Health was also preparing to administer roughly 3,000 vaccinations Tuesday along with Ballad Health, Sentara Healthcare and Mary Washington Hospital. As of Tuesday, more than 16,000 health care workers in the state have tested positive for COVID-19. Long-term care facilities account for nearly half of the state\u2019s death toll, which a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention forecasting model estimates could reach nearly 5,000 by the end of 2020. While Virginia is seeing a decrease in new COVID-19 cases reported since Saturday, the state continues to average more than 3,600 new cases per day, according to VDH numbers on Tuesday. Saturday\u2019s numbers recorded a peak: an average of more than 3,900 new cases over the last seven days and the second-highest daily case increase since March at 4,177 infections. The highest was last Wednesday: 4,398 new cases. Of the 288,309 total cases reported by the VDH on Tuesday, 249,040 have been classified as confirmed and 39,269 have been deemed probable, meaning people were symptomatic with a known exposure to COVID-19 but had not yet received a positive test result. The Virginia Hospital and Healthcare Association COVID-19 dashboard \u2014 which presents data back to March 28 \u2014 showed on Tuesday a total of 26,929 people have been hospitalized for COVID-19 and released throughout the pandemic, and 2,361 people are currently hospitalized with the virus or have test results pending. This marks yet another peak for the highest number of hospitalizations recorded in a single day. The current seven-day moving average is 2,156 people hospitalized. Before November, the highest average was 1,527 hospitalizations over a seven-day period in May. According to the VDH\u2019s COVID-19 dashboard, 16,187 people have been hospitalized statewide for the coronavirus, though the VDH website notes this figure under-represents the total number of hospitalizations. The percentage of positive results from COVID testing has jumped to 11.2%. When the state was entering Phase 1 on May 15, the positivity rate was 14.4%. On Tuesday, the VDH reported 37,686 cases associated with the state\u2019s 1,691 outbreaks. The VDH classifies an outbreak as at least two lab-confirmed cases. The VDH dashboard operates on a roughly 17-hour delay in the reporting of statewide numbers. Figures on the website might not include cases or deaths reported by localities or local health districts.","288":"Albemarle County\u2019s COVID-19 ordinance now more closely matches the state\u2019s. Last week, Gov. Ralph Northam announced limits on public and private gatherings to no more than 10 people, a nightly curfew and expanded mask requirements. During a virtual meeting Wednesday, the Board of Supervisors adopted an emergency amendment to the county\u2019s COVID-19 ordinance, limiting gatherings and adding descriptions of which places are not public and other things that were in the state\u2019s restrictions. \u201cIn section six, we retain our face covering standards, which differ from the executive order in that we require written documentation from a healthcare professional to establish the basis to be excused from wearing a face covering,\u201d said County Attorney Greg Kamptner. Kamptner said some gathering size limits and face covering requirements that are not specified in the county\u2019s ordinance refer to some businesses and activities to the governor\u2019s most recent executive order. A non-emergency version of the county\u2019s ordinance is scheduled for public hearing on Jan. 6. \u201cWhat we have been doing is to have our ordinances be valid for roughly 60 days or so, so that we are keeping up with changes in the conditions of the pandemic,\u201d Kamptner said. Ryan McKay, senior policy analyst for the Thomas Jefferson Health District, told the board on Wednesday that Albemarle County had 87 cases of COVID-19 in the seven days ending Nov. 30, and that has more than doubled to 202 cases in the seven days ending Dec. 14. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve been finding is that these cases are tied in large part due to social gatherings, many of them around Thanksgiving,\u201d he said. \u201cOthers are not necessarily Thanksgiving, but events that have occurred in larger gatherings ... \u201d He said the health district now has larger numbers of contacts to trace, and that has \u201cpresented a significant challenge\u201d to their contact tracing and case investigation. \u201cWe continue to contact everyone that we can, [who] we\u2019re able to reach,\u201d McKay said. \u201cWe have implemented some abbreviated investigation protocols that help us get through the investigation a little bit quicker. But we are making all of our attempts to contact individuals and also let individuals know they may be considered a close contact.\u201d Some supervisors questioned hospital numbers, and asked about capacity and staffing numbers. \u201cAs a locality, this has got to be part of the question and concern,\u201d said board chairman Ned Gallaway. \u201cWe talk about cases, positivity rates and hospitalizations. Is there any cooperation at all about us understanding what our local capacity is in our hospital?\u201d Deputy County Executive Doug Walker said University of Virginia staff, and sometimes the health system, are on a weekly regional COVID-19 update call. McKay said the health district meets with UVa three times a week. \u201cI think they are concerned about the potential for capacity issues as cases continue to increase across Virginia, but I\u2019m not aware of anything significantly today that\u2019s of concern in terms of their current capacities,\u201d McKay said. Internally, the UVa Health System is providing a COVID-19 inpatient snapshot at the hospital about three times a week. When The Daily Progress asked for this information in July, it was told that it was a \u201cleadership message\u201d that is an \u201cinternal communication intended for our faculty and staff to keep them informed of news and events at UVa Health,\u201d and that \u201cit is not for public distribution.\u201d In screenshot images of the snapshots provided Wednesday by a UVa doctor, there were about 47 cases of COVID-19 at the hospital as of late Monday morning. That number had dropped to 38 cases Wednesday morning, with two people under investigation. The supervisors postponed the meeting\u2019s evening agenda items to its Jan. 6 meeting due to an ice storm that blanketed the region Wednesday.","289":"RICHMOND \u2014 A report released Friday on a University of Virginia COVID-19 model said the post-Thanksgiving surge led to a substantial spike in virus projections. The new estimated peak, according to the model, would occur the week of Feb. 8 with 14,000 new cases per day \u2014 nearly 14 times the summer\u2019s peak of 1,079 daily cases and almost four times the current average of 3,564 new cases per day. \u201cCold weather, time indoors and pandemic fatigue, spurred by holiday travel and gatherings, increase the risk of transmission. Meanwhile, the impact of new vaccines, while promising, will not be felt for several months,\u201d said the report, which is put together weekly by a team at UVa\u2019s Biocomplexity Institute that runs the COVID-19 model. \u201cIf compounded with surges accompanying Christmas, Hanukkah and other winter holidays, it could be a long, cold winter.\u201d As of Friday, the state has recorded 299,388 cases since March 7. UVa\u2019s model projects Virginia could surpass that amount with an additional 402,731 cases in 2021. On Friday, the VDH launched a weekly dashboard listing the outbreaks within medical care facilities, state agencies, summer camps and K-12 grade schools. Long-term care facilities and schools previously were displayed on separate dashboards. VCU Medical Center has the second-highest number of outbreaks in progress among medical facilities, with at least 16 cases associated with the outbreak. Some numbers are omitted from the data if it involves fewer than five infections. The most recent outbreak, according to the dashboard, was on Dec. 11, with seven cases. For an outbreak to be considered closed, 28 days must pass without a new case or possible symptoms. \u201cThe safety of our patients, visitors and team members is our No. 1 priority. Like members of the public and those we serve, health care workers are also affected by the COVID-19 pandemic,\u201d said VCU Health spokeswoman Laura Rossacher, who added that \u201cmany\u201d staff members attributed their infections to community exposure. \u201cThis serves as a reminder to remain vigilant and follow public health guidelines at all times, in particular over the upcoming holidays.\u201d On Friday, 40,269 cases were associated with the state\u2019s 1,770 outbreaks. The VDH classifies an outbreak as at least two lab-confirmed cases. Virginia hasn\u2019t seen a day in the past two weeks where fewer than 3,000 new COVID-19 cases have been recorded, according to data from the Virginia Department of Health. On Friday, the VDH reported 3,295 new cases. Virginia is now averaging 3,564 cases per day, more than doubling the 1,761-case average a month ago. On Dec. 12, the state average was nearly 4,000 cases. The percentage of positive results from COVID-19 testing has increased to 11.8%. When the state was entering Phase One on May 15, the positivity rate was 14.4%. Of the 299,388 total cases reported Friday, 256,999 have been classified as confirmed and 42,389 have been deemed probable, meaning people were symptomatic with a known exposure to COVID-19 but had not yet received a positive test result. The state has had 4,598 deaths, a toll the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s forecasting model estimates could reach nearly 5,000 by the end of this year. The Virginia Hospital and Healthcare Association COVID-19 dashboard \u2014 which presents data back to March 28 \u2014 showed a total of 27,471 people have been hospitalized for COVID-19 and released throughout the pandemic, and 2,409 people are currently hospitalized with the virus or have test results pending. As of Friday, the state is averaging 2,293 hospitalizations over a seven-day period. According to the VDH\u2019s COVID-19 dashboard, 16,684 people have been hospitalized statewide for the virus, though the website notes this figure under-represents the total number of hospitalizations. The VDH dashboard operates on a roughly 17-hour delay in the reporting of statewide numbers. Figures might not include cases or deaths reported by localities or local health districts. For questions regarding COVID-19 and vaccines, the VDH has a hotline at (804) 205-3501.","290":"The Better Business Bureau of Virginia lists scams related to COVID \u2014 including phony antibody tests that are promoted over the internet; online sites that \u201csell\u201d masks but never deliver the products as ordered; and fake employment sites that take upfront money but never provide the promised job, or put people to work (often repacking and shipping stolen goods) but never pay the promised wages. Now the Charlottesville police and sheriff\u2019s departments are reporting a different type of scam: phone messages to residents purportedly from a law enforcement officer and asking recipients to return the call to discuss an \u201curgent legal matter.\u201d The messages can sound threatening, alluding to dire legal consequences if the call isn\u2019t returned. If a recipient does return the call, then the scammer has the victim at his mercy and can exert additional pressure to frighten or confuse the victim into revealing personal information or perhaps even sending money. The messages can seem to be legitimate by apparently originating from a local area code, but this can be the result of a trick called phone spoofing, in which scammers piggyback off a local number. Residents who receive these types of calls are encouraged to contact the Charlottesville-UVA-Albemarle County Emergency Communications Center non-emergency line at (434) 977-9041.","291":"The number of COVID-19 patients being treated at the University of Virginia Medical Center is increasing as more area residents catch the virus, but hospital officials say they are not being overwhelmed. Officials on Wednesday said that they have a lot of flexibility remaining at the hospital in terms of bed space and can move staff around as needed to treat those who contract the disease. The hospital is currently treating regular medical and emergency patients as well as those who have COVID, although the latter are isolated. The number of people reported as hospitalized at UVa for COVID increased from about 40 last week to nearly 60 this week. The number of patients varies from day-to-day depending on how many are admitted or discharged. Numbers posted on the UVa COVID dashboard showed 63 patients in the hospital being treated for the virus on Dec. 21. Other counts distributed by the hospital show 56 people were in the hospital on Wednesday with 15 on ventilators. The Thomas Jefferson Health District statistics showed about 345 under hospital care in the region. Early in the pandemic, UVa accepted many patients from outside of the area but officials said the recent influx have been from Central Virginia. \u201cThe majority of our patients are being treated through our outpatient program, but we have seen an uptick in our inpatients,\u201d said Wendy Horton, the medical center\u2019s chief executive officer. \u201cA lot of the volume we\u2019re seeing today is literally from within our community.\u201d Horton said the hospital has plenty of room to increase COVID care capacity and have cross-trained staff to work in the unit, if needed. That, she said, allows administrators to respond quickly to solve a sudden surge. \u201cWe\u2019re feeling well prepared. We have adequate personal protective equipment and we check on the status of each unit each day,\u201d Horton said. \u201cWe\u2019re working as a team and members are flexing and filling in throughout the system, where they\u2019re needed. We have the ability to flex-in new [COVID treatment] beds, if needed.\u201d Horton said nearly 1,600 medical staff and caregivers who work near or with COVID patients have received their vaccinations since the shots became available last week. Another 4,300 have signed up for the vaccines. Both currently available vaccines require two doses to provide protection. \u201cOur goal is to try and vaccinate all of UVa Health personnel by March, and that would include the second dose,\u201d she said. Dr. Costi Sifri, director of hospital epidemiology, only three staff have reported adverse reactions to the vaccine shot, which occur with 15 minutes to 30 minutes of the shot. Those included bouts of nausea and light headedness, but nothing more serious. There have been scattered reports in Great Britain and across the U.S. of some people having serious adverse reactions, including anaphylaxis, a serious and sometimes fatal allergic reaction. The reaction is rare as Centers for Disease Control statistics show about one person in a million suffers from it after taking vaccines of any sort. Sifri said the hospital is receiving shipments of both the Pfizer vaccine and Moderna vaccines, which have received emergency approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. He said three other vaccines are far along in development and could hit the market by March or early summer of next year. The two approved vaccines use tiny pieces of the COVID-19-causing virus\u2019 spike protein, called lipid nanoparticles, to stimulate the body to produce immunity. The other vaccines in development use different stimuli to produce antibodies. \u201cThere are different types of vaccines that focus on different aspects of the virus to create antibodies and they are still under development,\u201d Sifri said. \u201cOur hope is to have different types of vaccines that will lend themselves to different types of people.\u201d Mutant strains of the pandemic virus that reportedly make it more communicable should still be limited by the vaccine, Sifri said. \u201cThe mutation is very small, one or two amino acids among hundreds, and it may change the binding of one antibody but there are hundreds of others it doesn\u2019t change,\u201d he said. Sifri noted that it researchers are still unsure if the vaccine will prevent a person from spreading the virus to others and recommends those who receive it continue to social distance and wear masks. The relatively short time it took to develop the vaccine is due in part to the effort governments around the world put into creating it, he said. The speed is also due to lessons learned in developing other vaccines over the past two decades and the fact that there were plenty of patients to study. \u201cIt was about 10 months from the mapping of the [virus\u2019] genome to an effective vaccine and that\u2019s because we were dealing with a pandemic,\u201d Sifri said. \u201cThere will be more emerging pathogens in the future, but it\u2019s good to know we have these vaccine platforms developed for [COVID] that we can work off of.\u201d While officials await more vaccines to distribute, officials said the UVa Health system will continue its community COVID testing program offered Monday evenings at Church of the Incarnation in Albemarle County and Tuesdays at Mount Zion First African Baptist Church in Charlottesville. The health district also offers free testing. Times and dates for both are available on the Virginia Department of Health website.","292":"Doctors treating Central Virginia\u2019s COVID-19 patients say vaccines against the virus are proving safe and recommend people take the vaccine as soon as it\u2019s offered. The University of Virginia physicians say they understand that people, especially in communities of color, may distrust the medical community but they say the vaccine is the best bet to help minority communities being hit hardest by virus. \u201cWe knew we\u2019d be the first group to get it and we were looking forward to getting it as soon as possible,\u201d said Dr. Cameron Webb, a geriatric specialist who works with COVID patients and serves as the UVa hospital\u2019s director of health policy and equity. \u201cWe did the research and we looked at the safety statements and reviewed the literature,\u201d Webb said. \u201cI felt like we know more about this vaccine than any other I\u2019ve had in my life.\u201d Webb and his wife, UVa hospital emergency room physician Dr. Leigh-Ann Webb, got their shots together on Thursday, Dec. 17. \u201cOn Friday I had some muscle discomfort in the arm but I typically get sore with the flu vaccines as well. By the time I woke up [last] Saturday, the soreness was gone. I had a couple of minor joint pains, but they didn\u2019t last long,\u201d Webb said. \u201cMy wife actually had a fever [last] Friday, right about 101.8. For her, that\u2019s a typical vaccine reaction. She woke up [last] Saturday morning and felt back to normal.\u201d \u201cI basically had zero side effects. It was a pretty boring procedure for me,\u201d said Dr. Ebony Jade Hilton, an anesthesiologist and critical care physician who works with COVID patients at UVa Medical Center. \u201cI don\u2019t usually have much of a reaction to vaccines.\u201d The doctors, and others who have taken the vaccine, will need to get a second shot in three to four weeks. Dr. Taison Bell, a critical care physician and director of the medical intensive care unit at the medical center said the second shot may have a stronger reaction. \u201cI have friends who were in on the trials and said the booster creates more immunological response, like fevers or aches,\u201d said Bell, who will get his booster shot on Jan. 5. \u201cIt\u2019s not anything to be worried about. [A reaction] is a sign that things are working the way they should and that your body is creating antibodies.\u201d \u201cFevers and aches are classical vaccine reactions. It means your body\u2019s immune system is gearing up and you\u2019re gaining immunity,\u201d said Webb. \u201cIt\u2019s not a reverse reaction, it means that your body is learning to recognize and build immunity.\u201d Reports of strong allergic reactions to the vaccine have been reported in Great Britain and the U.S., but the doctors say those reactions occur to about one person in every one million. \u201cAs more vaccine is distributed, will see if the numbers are higher, but they appear to be similar to other vaccines. Of course, if you\u2019re that one person, it\u2019s devastating. If people are on multiple allergy medications \u2013 and I know people who take five or 10 medications \u2013 it\u2019s important to talk with their doctor,\u201d Hilton said. \u201cOverall, the safety profile of this vaccine is similar to others. We know people, typically, refer to a normal immune reaction as a side effect, but if you develop a fever or body aches, that\u2019s an immune reaction that means your body is working. It\u2019s natural,\u201d she said. The doctors recommend anyone with doubts about taking the vaccine research it. They also suggest using multiple sources of information. \u201cWe\u2019re encouraging folks to do their research and suddenly people are running up against terms that they have never heard, like lipid nanoparticles,\u201d Webb said. \u201cPeople are trying to get up to speed and when you\u2019re looking for information you sometimes find good sources and other sources that aren\u2019t so good.\u201d Hilton said it is important for people in minority communities to get the vaccine when it becomes available. \u201cThis is affecting us more. We are dying at younger ages than white people. We\u2019re dying at rates that are equal to white people who are 10 years older than us,\u201d she said. \u201cThis happens a lot to minorities. We have higher death rates, infant mortality, breast cancer and other rates. We have less access to health care. There\u2019s an old saying that your zip code is more important than your genetic code when it comes to medicine. Where you live is often more important than your genes.\u201d Hilton noted that pollution, air quality and water quality often are worse in predominately Black and Latino communities. She noted that six years after lead and other chemicals were found in dangerous levels in the Flint, Michigan water system, the predominately Black population is still being warned by the federal government to not cook or brush their teeth with the water. \u201cDifferent people have different responses to the medical community. For undocumented people, they worry that \u2018if I get it, will I walk out the door and have an ICE agent waiting for me? For African Americans, it\u2019s a historical mistrust based on historical events,\u201d Hilton said. \u201cWe need to address that. We need to say that \u2018we have shown you time and time again, for many generations, that you should not trust us. We are making changes to earn that trust.\u2019 And then we have to do it,\u201d she said. For minorities, it\u2019s even more important to research the virus to help overcome historic mistrust of the medical community, the doctors said. Hilton noted that mistrust goes back nearly 200 years. Many studies were conducted on enslaved worker in the 1800s, including those conducted in the 1840s on enslaved women by Dr. James Marion Sims, once heralded as \u201cthe father of modern gynecology.\u201d A 1830s advertisement published by the South Carolina Medical College, now the Medical University of South Carolina, proclaimed that the college could obtain patients from the enslaved community \u201cin sufficient number for every purpose, and proper dissections carried on without offending any individuals in the community.\u201d Medical tests, experiments and forced sterilizations continued into the 1900s, often as part of eugenics studies. Blacks, as well as prisoners, served as test subjects, usually without being told of the studies or being asked for permission. The most well-known of those experiments was Tuskegee University\u2019s 40-year clinical study of syphilis conducted on 399 poor Black men who were not told they had the sexually transmitted disease or that they were not being given treatment. U.S. Public Health Service researchers instead studied the disease\u2019s progression, including its transmission to family members, and did not to treat the subjects even after penicillin became the primary cure in 1947. The study continued from 1932 to 1972 when news coverage of the study forced its closure. An estimated 128 participants died either from the disease or complications. An estimated 40 spouses were infected with the disease and 19 children were born with congenital syphilis. The Public Health Service conducted a similar experiment in Guatemala from 1946 to 1948. \u201cIt comes down to a mistrust of government and the medical community and that\u2019s something we in the medical community need to address. Our best hope is to prevent COVID with a vaccine because there is no cure,\u201d Hilton said. \u201cFor that, we need people to feel comfortable in getting the vaccine.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s normal to have questions and concerns about something that is going to be injected into your body,\u201d Webb said. \u201cIn many instances, we ridicule people who are worried, but it\u2019s normal to be hesitant. The question is how do we address those concerns?\u201d Webb said he was ready to take the vaccine because of his experience treating patients with the disease and his research. \u201cI was an early adopter because of what I\u2019ve seen clinically and I\u2019ve been following the development of the virus and the vaccine for 10 months. Other people aren\u2019t in that situation. We need people to understand how it was developed,\u201d he said. The vaccine was created quickly using methods developed through the creation of other vaccines and an all-out international push to find a vaccine. It uses a tiny portion of the virus, called a lipid nanoparticle, to stimulate the body into creating antibodies. \u201cIf you think of a car, when you take the vaccine you get a steering wheel. Your body looks at that steering wheel and says \u2018that doesn\u2019t belong here\u2019 and develops antibodies to clean it out,\u201d Hilton said. \u201cThe next time it sees a steering wheel, it will automatically get rid of it.\u201d Although the vaccine will bolster immune systems and is believed to be about 95% effective, that doesn\u2019t mean that someone cannot become an asymptomatic virus spreader. The doctors agreed that, even after the vaccine, people should continue social distancing and wear face coverings. \u201cWe can\u2019t say that it prevents people from getting infected. We can\u2019t say that it will be impossible to spread it, if they do get infected,\u201d Webb said. \u201cWhat we can say is that the chances are significantly less and, with the increased immunity, the impacts will be significantly less.\u201d \u201cThe vaccine is the hope we have to end this pandemic,\u201d Bell said. \u201cWe have a conversation we need to get out there. There are people who want information and they need health care providers to be held accountable.\u201d \u201cI feel like I\u2019m on my way to getting last bit of protection and it\u2019s good knowing that by January, when I get that second dose, I\u2019ll be vaccinated against COVID,\u201d Webb said. \u201cI\u2019ll continue to take the precautions we\u2019ve been taking, with masks and social distancing, but I\u2019ll have that background level of security knowing that my body will have an extra bit of defense.\u201d","293":"LOUISA \u2014 For Lloyd Runnett, helping others isn\u2019t just a lifestyle, it\u2019s a ministry. Over the last four decades, Runnett has served the people of Central Virginia in various roles, including 30 years with the Henrico County Fire Department, where he was a battalion chief, and assisting with homeland security as a part-time Federal Emergency Management Agency instructor. Soon after retiring from the fire department, Runnett joined the Louisa County Resource Council in 2015, helping the nonprofit to expand significantly. \u201cI just couldn\u2019t stay retired when there was work to do,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe one of these days I\u2019ll stay retired, but that day hasn\u2019t come yet.\u201d A humble and affable man, Runnett attributes much of his dedication to benevolence work to the example set by his parents, who taught him the value of community service at a young age. \u201cWe actually have a program here, the emergency food pantry, which has been around probably since the \u201860s that my mom and dad delivered food for, and I can remember riding in our old station wagon, going with them to deliver food,\u201d he said. \u201cThat same program still exists today and I\u2019ve managed it, which is a pretty cool deal.\u201d A guiding principle of Runnett\u2019s life has been to treat others as he would want to be treated, the golden rule, or the \u201cJesus rule,\u201d as he refers to it. \u201cThis really is a ministry to me \u2014 I make no bones about it, and that\u2019s where I get a lot of my motivation,\u201d he said. \u201cWe get to create future community stakeholders here \u2014 the next succession of people who will build a better community.\u201d In an effort to find and cultivate these future community-minded people, Runnett also serves as a mentor in a leadership class at Louisa County High School. Carrie Hicks, who teaches the class to 10th- through 12th-graders, said each year Runnett inspires her students to be more active in their community and take on new, challenging roles. \u201cIt\u2019s really eye-opening for them to hear about the need within our community and all of the different programs that the Resource Council offers,\u201d Hicks said. \u201cBy the end of just hearing him talk and listening to what he and his programs do, the kids have tears in their eyes and they\u2019re just ready to help in any way they can.\u201d One of the programs Runnett helped to launch at the Resource Council is dedicated to getting Louisans the dental care they need. After working with the Thomas Jefferson Health District to assess health care needs in Central Virginia, Runnett said he learned that access to affordable care, and dental care in particular, was lacking in Louisa County. In an effort to meet these needs, the Resource Council started a partnership with the University of Virginia School of Nursing. For the last several years, nursing students have come to the Resource Council to help residents and to get some hands-on experience. Vickie Southall, an assistant professor of nursing at UVa and a friend of Runnett, said that each semester prior to the onset of COVID-19 her students would offer a range of services, including measuring blood pressure and blood sugar and answering questions about medication. Among the biggest projects the partnership has yielded, Southall said, is a program that provides $500 dental vouchers to those who qualify. People are able to come to the Resource Council, receive their vouchers and set up appointments with a local dentist, she said. \u201cOne semester, I tasked my students with researching dental care for adults in the area and what were some of the side effects of not having dental care, and they put all that together in a presentation and presented it to the board of directors for the Resource Council,\u201d Southall said. \u201cThey decided to adopt that as a project, and then the next semester we started working on it, and have continued to do so for the last several years.\u201d Runnett was a huge part of getting the dental program started, she said, and continues to help out the community in many other ways. \u201cHe does a lot of things that people don\u2019t realize,\u201d Southall said. \u201cI\u2019ve seen him go mow the yard for a family who\u2019s having a lot of health issues. I\u2019ve seen him help out a lot of families who\u2019ve fallen on hard times \u2014 and that\u2019s not really part of his job, that\u2019s just something that he does.\u201d Runnett\u2019s dedication to helping others is not lost on his colleagues on the Resource Council\u2019s board, who describe him as a \u201cgo-to guy.\u201d \u201cThanks to [Runnett\u2019s] decades of experience in emergency management, the LCRC has not missed a beat in providing assistance to all who have turned to us for help during the pandemic,\u201d a joint statement from Joan Lassiter and Cathy Portner of the Resource Council and Thomas von Hemert of the Thomas Jefferson Area Crisis Intervention Teams reads. \u201cHe is quick to tell you that his work as executive director of an organization that helps thousands of neighbors is a \u2018calling\u2019 and not a job for him.\u201d","294":"Then on Dec. 25, The Progress reported: \"For the second day in a row, Virginia hit a record-breaking high in new COVID-19 cases: 4,782\" (\u201cVirginia hit another record high in cases: 4,782\u201d). But our congressman-elect, Robert Good, feels that \"[t]his is a phony pandemic\" (WSLS TV, Dec. 24). My single wish would be for Mr. Good to work just one shift as a transportation aid at the University of Virginia Medical Center shuttling these very sick patients. Or perhaps he could don personal protective equipment and help care for the ventilator-dependent patients, watching the sickest of the sick die. Lastly, maybe he could assist in comforting the poor families of the children in the pediatric ICU. The disease is real, and Good\u2019s empathy for his ill 5th District constituents should match it. As a physician, I am asking him to please, please mask up. Be the example. Do what you can to halt the progression of COVID-19. John H. Post Albemarle County","295":"The Blue Ridge Health District, formerly known as the Thomas Jefferson Health District, received doses of the Moderna vaccine for COVID-19 the week of Christmas and vaccinated some of its staff Monday. Starting this coming Monday, district staff will begin vaccinating area EMS providers, dialysis center staff and Region Ten Community Services Board residential facility staff, according to a news release. The first doses of the vaccine will go to health care personnel and staff and residents at\u00a0long-term care facilities, as determined by the Virginia Department of Health and a federal advisory committee. After this first priority group has received the vaccine, doses will be open to additional essential workers, but exact categories haven\u2019t been decided yet. To assist with vaccination plans and to accommodate social distancing, the health district will set up a building in the parking lot of the former Kmart at the intersection of Hydraulic Road and U.S. 29. They\u2019ll start with at least three clinics per week at the Kmart site and plan to increase the frequency, depending on staffing and vaccine availability. The Kmart location was established with the help of Red Light Management and the Bama Works Fund. The district is asking frontline health care entities in Charlottesville and the counties of Albemarle, Fluvanna, Greene, Louisa and Nelson to complete a survey to let them know about their need for staff to be vaccinated. The health district is responsible for vaccinating everyone in this first group, known as 1a, other than those who work at the University of Virginia Medical Center and Sentara Martha Jefferson Hospital. Through a federal partnership, CVS and Walgreens will vaccinate those living at long-term care facilities, and those shots started this week. At The Colonnades, a local facility that includes assisted living, residents and staff members started to receive the vaccine in the first set of three clinics, which were completed Monday and Tuesday, said Craig Wagoner, the facility\u2019s executive director. The Virginia Department of Health surveyed long-term care facilities in the state on their preference for vaccine administration and then gave a list of sites to the two pharmacies. The next clinic will be the week of Jan. 18, and\u00a0Wagoner said he anticipates more residents will participate. He said staff members at The Colonnades are working to provide information about the vaccine through one-on-one discussions, town halls and letters. \u201cIt was heartwarming to see residents and team members happily roll up their sleeves, and you could feel them smiling behind their masks knowing that they were taking a step toward protecting themselves and others,\u201d he said. The vaccine\u2019s arrival comes as the health district saw its worst month of the pandemic. The district reported 2,181 new cases, 86 new hospitalizations and 10 new deaths in December. Additionally, the positivity rate is 7.9%, which is the highest it's been since mid-July. \u201cWe really saw what the aftermath of Thanksgiving was and social gatherings and people getting together,\u201d said Ryan McKay, the district\u2019s COVID-19 incident commander. \u201cWe're fully expecting that to actually get worse ... following the holidays.\" McKay said the district is hiring more case investigators to handle the increase in the need to trace all close contacts and slow the spread of the virus as much as possible. \u201cI think that's an important reminder\u00a0\u2014 that there's a long way to go with this,\u201d he said. \u201cEven though a vaccine is here, there's still a long way to go with just disease spread and disease burden on the community, and that's not going to change over the next couple of months.\u201d Since the FDA authorized the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines for emergency use in December, 3,179 people in the district\u00a0have received the first dose. The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines require two doses \u2014 21 days and 28 days apart, respectively \u2014 to be most effective. UVa and Martha Jefferson started giving shots to their staff Dec. 15. The state is planning to receive about 370,000 doses by the end of the week. So far, 64,882 doses have been administered in Virginia. McKay said there are about 5,000 to 8,000 people in the health district who can be vaccinated in the first priority group. That doesn\u2019t include hospital-affiliated staff. How many shots the health district can give in a week depends on their staffing and how many appointment slots are filled. Next week, if all of the appointments are filled, McKay said they could administer about 500 to 600 doses. The Virginia Department of Health has asked districts not to share how many doses they received. The district submits a weekly order for vaccine doses based on their plans to offer clinics. Rolling it out\u00a0 Vaccinating their staff first allowed the district to learn how to use the new vaccine management system in real time, troubleshoot glitches and work through logistics such as timing and spacing of administering the doses at the health district\u2019s main building on Rose Hill Drive in Charlottesville. They\u2019ll continue to train staff from that location and give shots to some EMS personnel there. Those eligible to receive the shot in this first phase will use the vaccine management system \u2014 a tool that\u2019s required by the state\u00a0\u2014 to register, make appointments and track when they need their second dose. Other health districts already have begun vaccinating EMS and other frontline workers. McKay said next week's start is in line with the district\u2019s envisioned timeline. They received doses of the Moderna vaccine the afternoon of Dec. 23. Additionally, they\u2019ve been able to learn from other districts and apply those lessons for their launch. \u201cSo that when we roll out to health care providers next week, we've already accounted for all those issues that people went through already,\u201d he said. \u201cThat gives us a little bit of an advantage in terms of efficiency and time and providing relatively easy access for this first group that's coming in.\u201d Fifteen public health nurses are in charge of giving shots, but with the help of Medical Reserve Corps volunteers, McKay said they hope to double their nursing capacity by the end of next week. That will mean they offer more appointment slots at the Kmart location and open up more sites. He expects they\u2019ll get more efficient over time. The National Guard will be assisting with the district\u2019s drive-thru COVID-19 testing\u00a0clinics, which frees up nurses to help with the vaccines. The health district has spent months planning for the rollout of the COVID-19 vaccine. The plans include hiring three more staff members to coordinate the program; finding locations for clinics; staffing and supplying those clinics; contacting health care employers to sign up their staff; and learning the new vaccine management system, among other things. \u201cIt's a big sort of puzzle in terms of fitting all the right pieces together,\u201d McKay\u00a0said. McKay said the health district has practiced vaccine rollouts over the years since H1N1 but not on this scale. \u201cIt hasn't necessarily been with a vaccine that has some different requirements to it in terms of, certainly, storage here at a different temperature,\u201d he said. The health district has one freezer and ordered two more that can store the Moderna vaccine. In talking with other health districts, McKay said the space required to allow people to social distance and wait for 15 to 20 minutes after receiving a dose of the vaccine has been a challenge. That waiting period could create a bottleneck, and limit their ability to vaccinate people efficiently, he said. That\u2019s when Red Light Management and the Bama Works Fund stepped in. The district met with group representatives on Dec. 23 to discuss the vaccine rollout and spacing options. With their help, the district will set up a clinic at the former Kmart parking lot. What the district is calling \u201ca large-scale modular structure\u201d will open in the middle of next week. \u201cIt gives us a chance to move through this phase 1a and then subsequent phases much more quickly,\u201d McKay said. \u201cSo it may seem small at first as we kind of get our footing and increase our capacity. But we feel like that by the end of this, it's going to be a huge advantage for us to be able to run multiple days a week for extended hours a day and really provide tremendous access for a good portion of the community, especially in the early phases of the campaign.\u201d As they build capacity, McKay said the facility could be open five to six days a week most of the day. Skyline Tent Company, Martin Horn and Riverbend Development also helped get the site ready, according to the release. McKay said they are working with county administrators in other localities in the district to identify fixed locations for clinics as they plan to ramp up vaccine efforts in future phases. \u201cThe site in Charlottesville is a huge lift off of our shoulders because we're not trying to sort of cobble together a series of locations early on,\u201d he said. \u201cWe know we can trust that the site will be there. Health care workers that are going to be vaccinated there know where to go and get it. So it's just a huge advantage for us to be able to have this location.\u201d","296":"They developed new ways to teach classes and new medical tests and protocols. They redesigned classrooms, living quarters and dining facilities. And they did it all in a matter of months. It\u2019s not like University of Virginia officials, staff, faculty and students had a choice. The changes were necessary due to the pandemic that began sickening and killing Americans in March. \u201cIt\u2019s obviously been an incredibly challenging year,\" said UVa President Jim Ryan. \"I feel like, from the beginning of March until right now, we stepped onto a roller coaster that just kept going. It was an almost constantly evolving situation.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cIt was like a constant snowstorm. It impacted not just finance, not just operations, but academics, health care, research, and made everything we do not just harder but required we sometimes do it in fundamentally different ways.\u201d It started in February as medical staff and administrators kept an eye on the SARS-CoV-2 virus ravaging China and Europe. On Feb. 28, administrators counseled students and staff to check travel warnings and restrictions before taking sanctioned trips for study or research. Then came March. On the third day, the academic division canceled study abroad programs that were scheduled over spring break. On the 11th day, all classes were moved online, to begin March 19, and on-site courses were canceled for the rest of the semester. Students who are away on spring break were encouraged to return home or remain at home. Students who stayed on Grounds and in town were encouraged to go home. Events with more than 100 people were prohibited. On March 16, the state followed UVa\u2019s lead by prohibiting gatherings of more than 100. On March 24, the governor ordered all schools to close their buildings for the remainder of the academic year. Shortly afterward, UVa Health System researchers announced that they had developed a COVID-19 saliva test on their own after a nationwide shortage of tests proved problematic for local testing. In the meantime, all but essential research was ordered shut down and telecommuting guidelines were put in place for those employees whose jobs allowed it. Summer programs were canceled. Students still on Grounds were moved around to provide emergency housing should it be needed for quarantine and administrators began looking at graduation ceremonies. \u201cThis crisis bears similarities to war efforts of the past when citizens had to make sacrifices and pull together for the greater good,\u201d Dean of Students Allen Groves wrote in an April 5 message to students. \u201cI regret some decisions have come very quickly with little advance communication, but the situation is exceptionally fluid right now and the university is part of larger efforts with new priorities emerging daily.\u201d The next day, UVa created a $2 million assistance fund to help workers furloughed by contracted companies, including those employed in dining halls and other services that relied on students being on Grounds. The fund was good until June. By mid-April, hiring freezes, spending cuts and freezes on merit pay were announced, as were cuts to senior executive pay. Graduation ceremonies were moved to online-only. At the month\u2019s end, UVa Medical Center employees were furloughed as the center was losing $3 million a day under a state ban on elective surgeries and non-emergency medical procedures. By mid-May, 561 Health System and 78 School of Medicine employees were on full-time, unpaid furlough, and the hospital saw an operating income loss of 48.1%. \u201cEveryone knows that when you take a new job, it is going to be a little different than you expect and there will be issues you\u2019ve never dealt with that no one thought to tell you about,\u201d said Provost Liz Magill, who joined UVa in the summer of 2019. \u201cWho would have predicted it would be a pandemic? You always know you have to pivot in your expectations, but this was a big unexpected surprise.\u201d In June, university officials announced they would reopen Grounds to students in the fall with a combination of online and in-person courses to being Aug. 25. \u201cOnce Jim made the decision to open, it was all hands on deck,\u201d said J.J. Davis, UVa\u2019s executive vice president and chief operating officer. \u201cWe had a can-do attitude. Everyone from the medical teams and academics to operations were all in. People genuinely cared and wanted to do the right thing.\u201d Davis said the decision to open galvanized the institution. \u201cWe decided we were going to be different. We were going to be up and operational and we just banded together to get it done,\u201d she said. \u201cWe found people doing things that were profound, and there were great takeaways about going forward.\u201d Magill referred to the effort as forced innovation. \u201cIt is what we had to do. We were absolutely determined to pursue the mission, however we had to do it,\u201d she said, noting that providing education, maintaining health and safety and getting things to work properly were major concerns. \u201cHealth and safety, the mission and logistics and operations, all come together in the classroom,\u201d Magill said. \u201cDoctors have to tell us what that classroom needs to look like. J.J.\u2019s people have to design the classroom and the faculty has to figure out how to teach that class online as well as in-person and how to do both at the same time.\u201d In July, UVa researchers developed a virus testing plan for students and staff at a time when COVID tests were still scarce and students who had returned to Grounds early seemed more interested in socializing than social distancing. On Aug. 4, administrators announced classes would begin Aug. 25 as planned, but would be online only at first, as moving onto Grounds and in-person courses were postponed for two weeks. Part of that delay allowed administrators to see what was happening at other universities as schools reopened, giving UVa a chance to talk with their collegiate counterparts and make last-minute tweaks in reopening plans. \u201cWe learned a fair bit from our conversations with other schools,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cOne of the useful things we did was delay the return of students. In those two weeks, we saw what happened at other universities where students had to go home shortly after they arrived.\u201d \u201cWe learned lots of things and shared ideas back and forth, things that worked well, as well as things that weren\u2019t going particularly well,\u201d Davis said. \u201cIt was really a living laboratory working with our peers in other schools because we were all real-time trial-and-erroring.\u201d Ryan said issues at other universities\u00a0\u2014 including James Madison University, Notre Dame and the University of North Carolina where COVID quickly broke out upon students returning and forced the schools to temporarily halt in-person classes\u00a0\u2014 showed them where their plans had shortcomings. \u201cIt became pretty clear that we needed more testing than we were planning on and we needed more quarantine capabilities if we were going to keep open,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it was also useful for incoming students as a real wakeup call that this was for real.\" Ryan said both administrators and students realized that, should the virus get out of control, students would need to be sent home and Grounds closed again. \u201cFor them to see that before they returned to Grounds just reinforced that the restrictions were not designed to ruin their time at college but enable them to stay there rather than go back to their parents\u2019 house,\u201d Ryan said. As the fall semester continued, university staff developed a variety of pandemic virus prevention protocols, from wastewater monitoring to regular asymptomatic testing. Restrictions on student socializing were tightened as the virus gained a stronger foothold in the area. With a few exceptions, Ryan said students followed the guidelines and kept down spread of the virus both on Grounds and in the Charlottesville community. Throughout the semester, the area had a low rate of positive tests and, even with students on break, still maintains a relatively low rate. \u201cIf I showed you my email inbox from mid- to late August, there were not many messages of optimism and hope for the upcoming semester,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cBut it turned out well. We have a remarkable [university] community with incredible faculty and staff and students.\u201d UVa currently plans to start the spring semester on Feb. 1 for undergraduate students and to ramp up testing for those coming to Grounds and living in town. Students must have a negative test just before returning and will be tested once a week during the semester. Students also must follow social distancing and mask requirements. That, Ryan said, is something he believes students proved they are willing to do. \u201cWe have a group of students that, quite frankly, did something no one thought they could do, and that\u2019s to follow protocols,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cThey weren\u2019t perfect, but it would not have worked without them. There were daily decisions by thousands of students to follow the plan and protect themselves and others. They deserve a lot of credit.\u201d","297":"During normal times, public health professionals do their jobs and you rarely hear about them. \u201cWe\u2019re sitting there in the background, just keeping people safe,\u201d said Dr. Denise Bonds, executive director of the Blue Ridge Health District. But when the COVID-19 pandemic took hold locally, Bonds and her team took on a much more public role. In the last 10 months, the health district has nearly doubled the size of its staff to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. The additional staff helped to conduct more than 5,200 testing clinics, contacted more than 20,000 people who were exposed to someone who tested positive for COVID-19, answered 11,500 calls to the hotline and responded to 2,858 complaints about alleged pandemic ordinance violations, among other tasks. The agency recently changed its name from the Thomas Jefferson Health District as part of an effort to be more equitable and inclusive. It was one of the first health districts in the state to create a dedicated coronavirus testing team. And it is one of the few to maintain a district-specific dashboard of COVID case data. The dashboard has been closely watched by community members and business operators and has helped to inform local governments\u2019 response plans. \u201cPersonally, this is one of the hardest things I\u2019ve ever done,\u201d said Bonds, who has led the district for six years and also recently became interim director of the Rappahannock Area Health District. Bonds said the district\u2019s goals for pandemic response are to ensure adequate testing in the community, investigate all cases and conduct contact tracing, respond to complaints in a timely manner and make sure the public has the information and data it needs. \u201cI think we have been very successful,\u201d Bonds said. \u201cAnd then on top of that, we were able to keep some continuity of our other critical services. Although COVID certainly consumes us, we have to keep a certain number of our regular services going to meet critical needs in the community.\u201d Those include providing flu shots, administering testing for sexually transmitted infections and inspecting well and sewage systems. The agency also offers family planning services, as well as support, education, food and health screenings for pregnant women, infants and children. The district's response to the pandemic has helped to\u00a0keep case numbers from skyrocketing so far, but the team's efforts have been especially\u00a0tested during the current surge, which\u00a0started around Thanksgiving. In recent weeks, the district has hired more staff members to investigate cases while also preparing to inoculate people against the virus. In collaboration with Bonds and her staff, Charlottesville and Albemarle County adopted local COVID-19 ordinances in July with stricter restrictions than called for in Gov. Ralph Northam\u2019s executive orders at the time. The local ordinances made masks mandatory in public and limited restaurants to 50% occupancy indoors. \u201cWe just wanted to make sure that we were just well-grounded in science and facts, and they\u2019re the experts,\u201d said Doug Walker, deputy county executive. As Albemarle\u2019s incident management team commander, he has worked with the Blue Ridge Health District on implementation of pandemic measures. Emily Pelliccia, deputy chief of the Charlottesville Fire Department and commander of the city\u2019s incident management team, said the city wouldn\u2019t have been able to strategize and make a plan of action without the health district. \u201cIf we didn't have their expertise to rely on, we would have been sort of flying blind,\u201d she said. 'Incredible efforts' Dr. Costi Sifri, a professor of medicine and director of hospital epidemiology and infection prevention and control at the University of Virginia Medical Center, said the health district has been critical to getting testing and other resources into the community and to promote mitigation measures such as hand-washing, wearing of masks and social distancing, the latter two being unpopular at times and challenged by some politicians. \u201cI don't think it's any exaggeration that [the health district\u2019s] incredible efforts over this last year saved lives,\u201d he said. \u201c... If there's anything that this pandemic has shown us is that we cannot take for granted public health and safety.\u201d The community\u2019s compliance with those measures, along with the health district\u2019s broader efforts to curtail spread of the virus, helped the medical center from becoming overwhelmed with COVID-19 patients, Sifri said. \u201cThis is a community that has flattened the curve,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are in the next wave of this pandemic, and we understand that we still have some difficult times ahead of us, but the health department has helped see us through this so far.\u201d During the pandemic, the health district and medical center have worked together to quickly contain potential hotspots at long-term care facilities and to assist groups of people who are vulnerable to the virus. Their level of communication and collaboration \u201cdoesn\u2019t happen everywhere,\u201d Sifri said. Albemarle County Executive Jeff Richardson said the district is serving as a hub for the region, so different localities and agencies can be on the same page. \u201cThey're good on so many levels,\u201d he said. \u201c... We feel like they are a department within our organization, and they're not a department within our organization. They're a regional agency that serves so many needs across our region but their bedside manner, so to speak, is so customer service friendly.\u201d He added that health district staff were readily available to answer questions and were patient as they worked through different issues. Walker agreed. \u201cThey are crystal-clear communicators of very complex information that, in doing so, projects extraordinary competence and confidence in the information that's available and in an evolving, changing, dynamic environment that has really defined the pandemic from the beginning,\u201d Walker said. \u201cBecause of having that grounding, it just obviously enables us to work so much better in how we then are serving our customers, which could be our employees and, of course, our community most importantly.\u201d Three waves District officials break down their COVID response so far into three waves. In the initial wave, most of the district\u2019s 91 staff members were involved with fighting the pandemic as some services, such as family planning and health inspections, were suspended and others moved all-online. Then, in the second wave, those services started back up again, and more employees were hired as the testing and investigations teams were built up. By early December, 55 employees had been added to the payroll, with another 15 contractors in the works. Bonds said that at first, responding to the pandemic was challenging because officials didn\u2019t have a great understanding of the virus, information about the virus and treatment options kept changing and staff members were working overtime to contain the crisis. As the district expanded its staff, Bonds said they were able to work more-regular hours. Over the summer and holidays, she encouraged the employees to take time off to recharge. Through it all, Bonds said the district's administrative staff has been essential as they worked behind the scenes to help hire new employees, get them on board and keep the office running. The health district\u2019s work in a typical year focuses on improving social determinants to good health, including housing and food issues, to help the community be as healthy as it can be, Bonds said. That mission will be even more important to help community members recover from the pandemic, which has had a disproportionate impact on communities of color and older residents, she said. Most of the 96 people who have died from the virus in the Blue Ridge Health District were 70 or older. So far, white people make up 52.7% of COVID-19 cases, 46.6% of hospitalizations and 70.8% of deaths in the district. African Americans make up 13.7% of cases, 33.3% of hospitalizations and 21.8% of deaths. Latinos comprise 15% of the cases, 12.7% of hospitalizations and 3.1% of deaths. The third wave of the district's response is under way as staffers prepare to vaccinate the approximately 250,000 people who live in the district. That effort involves hiring even more staff and building the infrastructure to sustain the program while continuing to investigate cases and offer other services. Bonds said this pivot is exciting \u2014 \u201cbecause we see it as the beginning of the endgame, as it were,\u201d she said. Bonds and other health district staff received the first dose of the Moderna vaccine Dec. 28. On Monday, the district is kicking off its vaccination program with a clinic for area EMS providers, dialysis center staff and Region Ten Community Services Board residential facility staff. Sifri, with UVa, said the vaccination effort is a \u201cherculean task\u201d that the district is being asked to lead. \u201cSo it's been a long year for them,\u201d he said. \u201cIt's been a long year for everybody in health care. But the work continues, and they realize that. I have every confidence that they're gonna see us through 2021.\u201d","298":"The following Central Virginia residents have been honored by The Daily Progress as part of the Distinguished Dozen series: 1995 Fletcher Arnitt Jr.,\u00a0FUMA teacher and coach;\u00a0Linda Bowen,\u00a0youth baseball booster;\u00a0Margaret McLeod Cain,\u00a0attorney;\u00a0Thomas J.

The board\u2019s 4-3 vote followed more than two hours of a wide-ranging discussion on the start date, how to provide assistance to at-risk students, the role of vaccinations in reopening decisions and what COVID metrics would be required to start in-person. Last month, division staffers revamped their plan for in-person classes, limiting them to preschoolers through second-graders while providing targeted assistance to other students in need such as those in special education and English-language learners. Throughout Thursday\u2019s discussion, board members were divided on the best way to restart in-person classes amid a surge in COVID-19 cases, especially as vaccination rollout has begun. The vote was the first about reopening that wasn\u2019t unanimous. Newly elected board Chairwoman Lisa Torres and members LaShundra Bryson-Morsberger and Jennifer McKeever voted no, saying they didn\u2019t think case numbers would improve by then. \u201cWe\u2019re at the beginning of the surge is what I\u2019m concerned about,\u201d McKeever said. The division has pushed back the start date for in-person classes several times, largely abandoning the quarter-by-quarter approach to learning models that it outlined in July. Some board members said constantly revisiting the date is causing more stress for staff and they advocated for having the data, not a set date, guide their decision. Schools Superintendent Rosa Atkins previously recommended starting in-person classes Jan. 19, and the board was supposed to review the COVID-19 data during Thursday\u2019s meeting. But in response to the rising numbers, Atkins suggested starting Model A on Feb. 22. Atkins said she hoped the extra time would give the case numbers time to decrease as well as allow for vaccinations to increase. School staff are included in the state\u2019s second priority group. No other details were presented as to how that date was decided. Atkins said that she was concerned about the safety of students and staff but also had \u201cgrave concerns\u201d about students for whom virtual learning is not working. \u201cEspecially when you get to our high school,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have students that we\u2019re going to lose in our high school because they\u2019re not engaged.\u201d Board members in support said that students are struggling with virtual learning and wanted to see students back in school. Board member Sherry Kraft said she didn\u2019t know if Feb. 22 was the right date and later suggested the March 8 option. \u201cWe have to try to get our kids back as soon as we can,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have to get it rolling.\u201d That seemed too soon for most board members, given that cases are projected to peak that day, according to a UVa model. McKeever said she supported a mid-March start date for classes but also wanted to see some elements of Model A started sooner. If high school athletic team can practice, she reasoned that some CHS students can go into the buildings for extra help during the mornings. \u201cI\u2019m just trying to make sure that our kids graduate,\u201d she said. The plan for Model A at CHS doesn\u2019t change the current schedule for virtual learning. However, Atkins didn\u2019t want to start providing assistance for students at only one school because that would create an equity issue. James Bryant, newly named vice chairman of the board, agreed with Atkins because that would leave out elementary students. McKeever strenuously disagreed with that stance. McKeever and Bryson-Morsberger said that they wanted to find a way to support students who are most in need without restarting in-person classes. \u201cSo while we\u2019re waiting to go back face to face, can we come up with a model that addresses those groups?\u201d Bryson-Morsberger asked. \u201c... Something to start somewhere.\u201d There was talk among some board members about creating a new model that would provide targeted supports from preschool to 12th grade, but it was unclear by the end of the meeting if that would happen. \u201cI think there\u2019s a lot of confusion about what is permitted and not permitted given our vote,\u201d McKeever said near the end of the meeting, adding that she would like to see broader thinking about what\u2019s possible and what students need. This school year, the board has not weighed in on every reopening decision. The division has provided in-person support for students in special education programs without explicit board approval. Additionally, the board has not discussed the status of winter sports, even as other school divisions have opted out of the season. Bryson-Morsberger said the Feb. 22 date was arbitrary and wanted to see a focus on improving virtual learning for students right now. \u201cBecause the date chasing is just creating more stress than there needs to be,\u201d she said. \u201c.... It would be a shame when we\u2019re this close to the vaccine, and we\u2019re in the middle of the surge for us to just make a decision because we\u2019re all getting COVID fatigue. I just think it\u2019s better if we really base it on what we know is coming.\u201d The School Board and division leadership have been using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s indicators and metrics to evaluate the local case numbers and positivity rate. The metrics are used to gauge risk levels from lowest to highest risk of COVID transmission in the schools. Neither division staff nor the board have set what those different risk levels mean for in-person classes. The two indicators are case incidence rate, which is determined by the total of new cases per 100,000 residents over the last 14 days, and the percent positivity rate, which is an average of positive cases over the same time period. Localities throughout the health district have case incidence rates in the highest risk category following the surge of cases that started around Thanksgiving, and positivity rates vary from moderate to highest risk. Although numbers in Charlottesville and Albemarle are lower than surrounding localities, Beth Baptist, the city school\u2019s COVID liaison, said the city is not an island. \u2018We have to remember Charlottesville is not an island, because we\u2019ve got people coming in and people going out every day so there\u2019s so much movement back and forth,\u201d she said. As of Thursday, the city\u2019s positivity rate over the last 14 days was 5.9% while case incidence rate is at 453.1. December was the worst month of the pandemic as the Blue Ridge Health District reported 2,181 new cases, 86 new hospitalizations and 10 new deaths. Currently, 69 people with COVID-19 are hospitalized at the University of Virginia Medical Center. In December, Atkins said she wanted the case incidence rate to be closer to 200 or trending toward that figure to start in-person classes. A rate below 200 would be considered in the higher risk category by the CDC.","300":"Money collected by the Santa Fund for Schoolkids, which is in its 126th year of serving Central Virginia, is used to buy clothing, shoes, medicine and other necessary items for children in need.

Hospital officials said Friday that while there may be physical space for additional patients, staff members may be needed in COVID wards, forcing officials to temporarily not accept transfers or new admissions. How many patients may be accepted can vary from day to day and even hour to hour depending on staffing levels and the number of patients in the hospital. \u201cStaffing is critical to being able to treat patients, and as COVID patients increase in the hospital, we need to move our staff around,\u201d said Dr. Reid Adams, interim chief medical officer for the hospital. \u201cIf we don\u2019t have a bed or we don\u2019t have the staff available to take care of others, we may have to hold off on being able to admit them.\u201d Reid and Dr. Costi Sifri, director of hospital epidemiology, discussed the UVa Medical Center\u2019s response to the pandemic, as well as plans for vaccine distribution, during an online press conference Friday. Reid said staffing is always an issue. \u201cStaffing is tight every day, even without COVID, so it\u2019s a matter of reorganizing the staff to care for those COVID patients while providing care for all the other patients in the hospital,\u201d he said. Sifri said COVID is having a similar impact at hospitals across the state. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing increasing rates of cases in the community that are impacting us while other parts of the state are being impacted even more,\u201d Sifri said. \u201cThat has downstream impacts for available beds across the state.\u201d Numbers posted on UVa\u2019s COVID dashboard show 69 patients were in the hospital for COVID treatment as of Wednesday. Other numbers compiled by the hospital show 17 patients are on ventilators. Just prior to Christmas, there were an estimated 63 COVID patients hospitalized with 15 on ventilators. According to the Blue Ridge Health District, on Thanksgiving Day there were 59 people being treated for COVID, whether inpatient or outpatient. The health district includes Charlottesville and Greene, Louisa, Nelson, Fluvanna and Albemarle counties. The number more than doubled to 133 on Dec. 27. As of Friday, that number stood at 185. Reid and Sifri said the increases are worrisome, but that the hospital so far is not facing an overwhelming surge like hospitals in Los Angeles and elsewhere. \u201cWe hope we don\u2019t see that,\u201d Reid said. \u201cWe have seen a steady increase in the number of patients needing care and an increase in the number of people testing positive across the commonwealth. We\u2019re looking at almost one in five people in Virginia possibly carrying the virus and one in 10 in [the region].\u201d According to the Virginia Department of Health, between 16% and 18% of people tested for COVID are showing positive results. In the Blue Ridge Health District, about 10% of tests currently are coming back positive. As the number of cases increases, so has the UVa Health System\u2019s effort to vaccinate its staff and employees. Sifri said about 7,500 employees had received at least their first dose of the vaccine as of Friday. The hospital is responsible only for its employees and is providing vaccines for medical staff, housekeeping and other crews working in the hospital, as well as staffers working predominately from home but who may need to come on site at any given time. Under the state\u2019s vaccine distribution plan, the area health department is in charge of distributing and administering vaccines to police, firefighters, emergency medical crews and employees of essential businesses. Pharmacies are responsible for distributing vaccines to long-term care facilities. Since the first vaccines were given to hospital medical crews in mid-December, UVa has gone from about 175 vaccinations a day to 850. \u201cWe have accelerated as much as we can to get as many of our team members vaccinated as possible,\u201d said Sifri. \u201cThat also includes the people who keep the lights on, keep the computers running and keep things clean.\u201d Vaccines are distributed as they come in to get as many employees their first dose as possible, officials said. Second doses will be distributed when they are available. \u201cWe are not holding anything in reserve to provide a second dose and we\u2019ve been clearly instructed not to do that,\u201d Sifri said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been assured that when those second doses are due, the vaccine will be available.\u201d","302":"ROANOKE \u2014 Colleges in Virginia should consider ramping up their COVID-19 testing from the fall semester, some public health experts say, if campuses even reopen at all in the coming months. Across Virginia\u2019s 10 largest universities, more than 7,100 students and about 850 employees tested positive for COVID-19 in the fall, according to an analysis by The Roanoke Times of school data. On average, four in every 100 undergraduate students became infected, and at least one in every 100 employees, though many more tests were not logged by the colleges themselves. Radford University had one of the highest rates, with an estimated 7.7% of undergraduates contracting COVID-19. Virginia Tech, which tested more students, had a rate of 5.7%. James Madison University in Harrisonburg was the only university whose case count also included tests self-reported by students. Those additional 910 cases, to 769 cases logged by JMU, brought the university\u2019s rate to 8.4%, though without them it stood at 3.9% of undergraduates. In September, a week after classes began, an outbreak forced JMU to shut down campus for a month. Counties with large colleges that held in-person classes saw a 56% increase in COVID-19 cases, compared to an 18% decrease in counties with colleges that held all-online classes by the time fall semester ended, according to a study published Friday by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \u201c\u2018Should they bring students back at all?\u2019 is a legitimate question,\u201d said Dr. John Voss, a professor of medicine at the University of Virginia, when asked what colleges might do differently in the spring. \u201cTo that extent, it depends on the school\u2019s ability to do testing and contact tracing to effectively isolate students from vulnerable, high-risk populations.\u201d Some universities in Virginia plan to increase their testing capacity this spring, but it may still not be enough to prevent coronavirus outbreaks. Some schools \u2014 including JMU, as well as Old Dominion University in Norfolk \u2014 already have announced delays to the start of in-person classes because of coronavirus conditions. \u201cWe\u2019re in a completely different place than we were in August,\u201d Voss said. \u201cThe infection rate is way higher, is likely to be way higher, in mid-January, February, when colleges start. That\u2019s still an open question in my mind.\u201d Tech and Radford are sticking with plans to bring students back to campus starting this week. Move-in at both schools will be staggered over multiple days, and the first few days of classes at Tech will be online-only. At both schools, in-person classes begin Jan. 19. Dr. Noelle Bissell, director of the New River Health District, said Wednesday that she does not expect the return of classes to spark outbreaks. \u201cIf we do get a bump, I don\u2019t think it will be anywhere near what we had in the fall,\u201d Bissell said. \u201cWe don\u2019t expect to see the surges like we saw before because most of those who are more social and maybe didn\u2019t abide by the precautions already had COVID.\u201d She said widespread community viral transmission exists nearly everywhere; transmission in classrooms and from the university to the community was not measurable; and that students overall did a good job of adhering to public health guidelines. \u201cI do want to get away from this blaming our students from bringing it or exacerbating it,\u201d Bissell said. Concerning rate There\u2019s no consensus around how much testing a college should do. But six out of nine universities analyzed by The Roanoke Times conducted fewer than one test per undergraduate student, a rate that some public health experts found concerning. Amber D\u2019Souza, a professor who studies infectious diseases and epidemiology at Johns Hopkins University, suggested at least 20% of students should be tested each week. \u201cIf testing less than that, it would serve to monitor and detect a large outbreak once it\u2019s occurring in campus,\u201d D\u2019Souza said in an email, \u201cbut may be too late to prevent the outbreak.\u201d Over the course of a 15-week semester, D\u2019Souza\u2019s suggested testing regimen would amount to 300 tests for every 100 students. Last fall, only UVa achieved such a testing capacity among the state\u2019s 10 largest colleges. Tech came second, conducting 126 tests per 100 students, while Radford administered 76 tests per 100 students, according to the analysis of school data. While school testing has largely focused on a much smaller subset of on-campus students, more off-campus students tested positive for COVID-19 for each of the five universities that broke out testing by student classification. \u201cIt\u2019s sort of crazy, really. We\u2019re a year into this pandemic and we still can\u2019t adequately test like we need to, to interrupt transmission,\u201d Dr. William Petri, a professor of medicine at UVa, said. The CDC gave colleges wide latitude in how to test. Particularly early on in the pandemic, the agency emphasized the need only to test those with symptoms, even though studies have found people without symptoms spread the virus in about half of cases. \u201cI think their guidance was tempered by what they felt colleges and schools could do,\u201d Voss said. \u201cSo it brings into play all kinds of questions about how advice coming out of the CDC was provided, given the political environment at that time.\u201d Voss said universities could think of the guidance as a \u201cminimum,\u201d but that, to him, \u201cmore testing may be more useful than they were willing to acknowledge at that time.\u201d He also cautioned that an overview of testing across an entire semester can hide nuance about its value, and a college\u2019s particular situation. \u201cJust doing testing without carefully thinking about how the testing will be used is not a fruitful way to use one\u2019s resources,\u201d Voss said. Comparing data about COVID-19 cases and testing across schools can be a challenge because each college can record counts slightly differently. And specific town-gown dynamics can determine how much testing a university may need to provide on its own. George Mason University in Fairfax County, for example, had the lowest testing rate among colleges studied \u2014 37 tests per 100 students. But with the smallest percentage of its undergraduates living on campus, more off-campus students may have sought tests elsewhere in the Washington suburbs. \u201cI cannot confirm if the rate you cite is the lowest in the state, as each university has a different approach and not all universities in the Commonwealth are conducting surveillance testing,\u201d Michael Sandler, a GMU spokesman, said in a statement. \u201cWhat I do know is that our approach is thorough and continues to evolve. All universities are constantly learning about COVID, and we continue to make adjustments and improve our efforts, in real time.\u201d JMU said its relatively low testing rate \u2014 46 tests per 100 students \u2014 did not take into account an additional 5,446 tests it facilitated through the Virginia Department of Health. Unlike Tech, UVa and other schools, JMU did not ask students to secure a negative test before arriving on campus or to be tested upon arrival. Tim Miller, vice president for student affairs at JMU, said that in the fall \u201cthe test option we had was two days to get a result.\u201d He said, \u201cyou can\u2019t really do much with that positive result.\u201d This semester, thanks to the state, JMU plans to conduct 6,400 rapid tests \u2014 with a 15-minute turnaround \u2014 as on-campus students arrive. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to know if any one thing or two things or 12 things would have made the fall different,\u201d Miller said. \u201cI\u2019m proud ... we did come back, and it was successful. I didn\u2019t want to just throw in the towel and say, \u2018That was really hard. Let\u2019s stop.\u2019\u201d System wrinkles Nicolette Gaff said she is looking forward to the spring semester on Tech\u2019s campus. Even though all her classes are online, it has been a challenge to meet new people, and, to save money, her roommate dropped out to attend community college. \u201cI was actually very close to staying home this semester, but I knew that all my hometown friends were going to school, and going away, and my sister, of course, was going to still be [at Tech],\u201d said Gaff, an 18-year-old freshman. \u201cI still wanted to grow as an individual, and I thought it may be difficult, but it definitely will be some self-growth.\u201d In September, Gaff tested positive for COVID-19 after one of her hallmates fell sick. Gaff opted to drive back to her home in Richmond, where she stayed holed up in her room. Her parents left meals outside her door. \u201cI thought they handled it really well,\u201d Gaff said of the university. \u201cThe only thing I was kind of stunned by was how I was notified\u201d that she had been exposed. Her hallmate told Gaff about testing positive, but nobody from Tech or the health department contacted her, she said. Virginia Tech\u2019s 43-page plan for the spring semester notes the university \u201cidentified challenges\u201d in managing cases or suspected cases of COVID-19. In response, the university hired three full-time staff members to help with contact tracing and assisting students who test positive, a spokesman said. Many campus residents who tested positive stayed in one of the university\u2019s isolation dorms. Over the fall, Tech increased space from 430 beds to 513 beds, a capacity it plans to keep for the spring. Some students identified wrinkles with the quarantine dorms early on in the semester, but acknowledged conditions may have improved later. One student came out of the dorm to find campus police had ticketed her car, which she was unable to move during isolation. Other students realized only after quarantine that they had spent far more than usual on food, because staff delivered meals from a nearby, and more costly, dining hall. Charlotte Haber, a Tech sophomore from San Francisco, recalls standing in a dining hall line one day with a friend who had just gotten out of isolation. The friend remarked, \u201c\u2018I don\u2019t know if I have any dining dollars left,\u2019 because at that point we kind of realized nobody knew how much they were spending in quarantine or isolation,\u201d Haber, 19, said. She said students could check that information in an online portal, but that \u201cthat is the furthest thing from some people\u2019s minds while they have COVID, especially if they\u2019re having symptoms.\u201d Haber tested positive for COVID-19 in the fall. She found out 15 minutes before an in-person English class, through an online health center portal. Later, she got a phone call from the housing office, and moved into a university isolation dorm for 10 days. She felt fortunate to have no symptoms. While many cases are mild in young people, Haber said students still need to stay vigilant. \u201cI really hope that people continue to take COVID seriously,\u201d she said. \u201cActually, that people take COVID more seriously, because not everybody really was.\u201d","303":"Lower-grade level elementary students in Albemarle County returned to classrooms Monday as COVID-19 case numbers are close to a division-set threshold for reverting back to all-virtual classes. Monday\u2019s classes were the first in four weeks; the division moved to all-virtual classes for the weeks before and after the two-week winter break as a precaution. Employees expressed concern on social media about going back to school buildings amid a surge in cases. The division announced Thursday that it would resume in-person classes Monday. If the county\u2019s positivity rate continues to stay above 8%, classes will revert to all-online next week. \u201cThis recent increase in virus transmission in our community was not unexpected following the holiday season ...,\u201d officials wrote in an email to families last week. \u201cAs always, we will be monitoring the data carefully and remaining in contact with our local health department.\u201d Among those working or learning in-person, 24 students, 41 staff members and four contractors have tested positive for COVID-19, according to the division\u2019s dashboard. Albemarle County is one of several area divisions that is continuing with in-person classes this month, though others have switched to all-virtual or delayed the start of in-person classes. Case numbers and positivity rates vary across the localities, and some with higher rates have continued with in-person learning. Officials in divisions offering in-person learning have cited confidence in mitigation measures, contact tracing and quarantine efforts, as well as the support of the Blue Ridge Health District, in their decisions. \u201cWe\u2019ve done well on that front,\u201d Albemarle schools spokesman Phil Giaramita said of the mitigation measures, which include wearing a mask and social distancing. \u201cThere\u2019s very little evidence of virus transmission in the schools, which tells us that the mitigation strategies are working.\u201d On Monday, the Blue Ridge Health District reported 126 new cases, bringing January\u2019s total to 1,385. Only 11 days in, that\u2019s already the second-highest total of new cases reported in a single month since the pandemic began in March. December had the most, with 2,218 new cases. Currently, 63 people with COVID-19 are hospitalized at the University of Virginia Medical Center, which has seen an uptick in virus-related hospitalizations. Because of that increase, UVa officials said last week that they were diverting patients to other hospitals to free up staff to treat pandemic patients. Giaramita said the Albemarle division talks with health district staff regularly and tracks COVID numbers every day. \u201cCertainly, we are concerned \u2014 there\u2019s no question about it,\u201d he said. \u201cWhether they\u2019re above or below those thresholds, the numbers have been going in the wrong direction, and we\u2019re going to carefully look at that.\u201d Around the region School divisions in the city of Charlottesville and the counties of Buckingham, Madison, Orange and Nelson are all-virtual right now. Madison and Orange made that switch last week and will remain online-only for about two weeks. \u201cOur school division is informing parents and guardians that numerous members of our school community are currently in quarantine or isolation due to COVID-19 exposure or awaiting test results,\u201d Madison schools Superintendent Anna Graham wrote in a letter to families Friday. \u201cCOVID-19 cases are increasing within our community and region, which creates an increased burden on hospitals in our area.\u201d Similarly, in Orange, the recent surge of cases in the community and the burden on the health care system were behind the division\u2019s decision to move to all-online, starting Jan. 6, according to the Orange County Review. Madison and Orange counties are part of the Rappahannock-Rapidan Health District. Monday night, Louisa County Public Schools announced it would go remote-only, starting Thursday and going through Jan. 29, because of a large number of staff members who are quarantined due to potential COVID-19 exposure from outside the schools. \u201cWe have to be at a place where we have enough staff to adequately uphold our health and safety standards,\u201d the division said in a video to families. \u201cFor today and tomorrow, we were able to come up with a short-term coverage plan, but it\u2019s not a sustainable, long-term plan.\u201d This staffing situation was one of three scenarios schools Superintendent Doug Straley said would trigger a switch to all-virtual classes. Last week, Andrew Woolfolk, spokesman for Louisa schools, said that since winter break, the division had seen an increase in the number of staff members who have had to quarantine because of exposure to COVID-19, and that it was something they were keeping a close eye on. Charlottesville public schools are still online-only, and the School Board recently delayed the start of in-person classes until at least March 8 because of the surge in cases. Similarly, the Nelson County school division has remained all-online so far this school year, but the School Board has set Feb. 1 as a target date for bringing children back into buildings and will review the metrics Thursday, according to a Dec. 11 announcement. The Buckingham County School Board will decide Wednesday whether students should continue with virtual learning, schools Superintendent Daisy Hicks said. Buckingham County is part of the Piedmont Health District. The Greene school division has offered a version of hybrid in-person learning since starting in September and isn\u2019t anticipating changes to those plans. \u201cThe BRHD has continued to express confidence in the efforts of Greene County Public Schools,\u201d Superintendent Andrea Whitmarsh said. \u201cWith the mitigation strategies in place and vigilance of our staff, we have not seen transmission of the virus within our schools.\u201d Greene students went back to school Jan. 4. The division\u2019s learning model includes five days a week for elementary students and twice a week for middle- and high-schoolers. \u201cAny deviations from this model would be decided based upon guidance from the Blue Ridge Health District, monitoring of cases within our schools, and our ability to effectively staff our in-person and virtual learning classes,\u201d Whitmarsh said. Fluvanna County Public Schools moved to a hybrid learning plan in November, and students returned to buildings after winter break. \u201cYes, the rising cases are of concern, but our mitigation strategies are working and we are safely educating children in person and virtually,\u201d Fluvanna schools Superintendent Chuck Winkler said. Second thresholdVirginia\u2019s school divisions have been using Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicators and metrics to evaluate the local case numbers and positivity rate. The metrics are used to gauge COVID transmission risk levels from lowest to highest in the schools. Two of the CDC\u2019s indicators are case incidence rate, which is determined by the total of new cases per 100,000 residents over the last 14 days, and the percent positivity rate, which is an average of positive cases over the same time period. Localities throughout Central Virginia have case incidence rates in the highest risk category following the surge that started around Thanksgiving, and positivity rates vary from moderate to highest risk. In November, Albemarle officials said if the case incidence rate was greater than 200 and the positivity rate was more than 8% for seven consecutive days, then classes would move to all-online. \u201cAnd the purpose of that is to account for temporary spikes that may not be sustaining,\u201d Giaramita said of the seven-day requirement. Currently, students in pre-K through third grade have in-person classes twice a week, while other groups of students, such as English language learners and those who haven\u2019t been engaging with learning virtually, are receiving in-person assistance at school. If the county crosses its thresholds, the division has said it will notify School Board members, employees and families immediately, and the transition would occur at the beginning of the following week. On Monday, the case incidence rate was 560.2, which is in the highest risk category. That figure has been above 200 since Dec. 5. The positivity rate was 8.6%, as of Jan. 7, and has exceeded 8% for two days, putting that rate in the higher risk category. That metric lags by four days, so positivity rates reported from Jan. 8-11 on the state\u2019s CDC dashboard are placeholders. Giaramita said the data lag makes the metric confusing. Because division officials only have positivity rates for Jan. 6 and 7, they would need five more days of numbers above 8% before switching to all-virtual, he said. \u201cReverting to all-virtual is a possibility,\u201d Giarmata said Monday, adding that he expects the division to say something more on the topic by mid-week. On Thursday, Albemarle schools Superintendent Matt Haas will recommend to the School Board whether to open up in-person classes to more students for the third quarter, which begins Feb. 1. Albemarle is one of a few school districts in the area that have set such thresholds. Last month, Straley with Louisa County, outlined in a video message the three scenarios that would lead to online-only classes, none of which is based on case numbers. Instead, Straley said that decision would be based on whether there\u2019s an unsafe situation in a building; if a significant number of staff members have to isolate or quarantine and they don\u2019t have enough substitutes to cover the vacancies; or if Gov. Ralph Northam or the CDC announce guidelines that wouldn\u2019t enable the division to offer in-person instruction.","304":"Because of the rise in COVID-19 cases, the University of Virginia Medical Center will ban visitors, with limited exceptions, effective Wednesday. The change applies to inpatient units, the Emergency Department, outpatient clinics and outpatient procedural areas, officials said in a Tuesday news release. UVa also is planning to expand its asymptomatic virus testing program to employees working on Grounds; students are set to return Feb. 1. UVa officials have said that if those plans change, they\u2019ll announce a decision by Jan. 15. The visitor restriction is the UVa Medical Center\u2019s latest move in response to the current surge of cases. Last week, officials said they were diverting patients to other hospitals to free up staff to treat COVID patients. \u201cThese changes are being made to help protect the health of our patients and team members as COVID-19 cases have increased in the Charlottesville area and throughout Virginia,\u201d medical center officials said in a news release. At Sentara Martha Jefferson, non-COVID-19 patients and those giving birth may have one visitor with them, under a policy that went into effect Nov. 20. Patients facing imminent death may have two visitors. In the cancer center and emergency department, no visitors are allowed. A Sentara spokesman said Wednesday that hospital staff are not planning to change the policy. According to UVa\u2019s COVID tracker, there are currently 61 people hospitalized for COVID-19 as of Tuesday with five new hospitalizations.. Since December 1, 118 more people in the Blue Ridge Health District have been hospitalized. In the early weeks of the pandemic, the medical center implemented a similar restriction, which was relaxed as conditions improved. Pediatric patients and those with disabilities can have one adult visitor with them during an inpatient admission, emergency department visit, or outpatient visit or procedure. All visitors must be screened before entering the hospital, must wear a mask at all times inside the medical center and must remain with the patient at all times, according to the release. Unit managers can make some exceptions for specific patients if the visitor is not COVID-19 positive and does not have symptoms of COVID-19 or other contagious diseases, according to the release. Exceptions could be made for patients giving birth or those at the end of their life. Patients or potential visitors should talk with medical center staff to discuss the exceptions. Those with questions about the visiting policy should call (434) 924-0000. Testing Last semester, UVa developed a saliva test for COVID-19 program for students and used a random testing program as a way to detect asymptomatic cases. The saliva test takes about 10 minutes to complete, and results are available within 72 hours. The university has now developed enough capacity to enable testing every student living on and off Grounds once a week, and is expanding the program, according to a Monday news release. The expansion of the program is geared toward employees working on Grounds. Other employees can still receive a free COVID test through the university\u2019s partnership with Let\u2019s Get Checked. \u201cWe recognize the difficulty and uncertainty this pandemic has created for members of this community, and we continue to focus on developing the tools and resources it takes for you to do your jobs safely and effectively,\u201d university officials wrote in a community message. UVa plans to administer the expanded employee saliva tests during the saliva testing clinics walk-in hours, but the university is planning to release a new platform for students and employees to schedule saliva testing appointments.","305":"The region saw a huge spike on Jan. 4 of 228 daily cases, as measured by date of onset. That number has declined more recently to 101 cases (or 118 for the weekly average, as of Jan. 13). Still, even that\u2019s a significant increase from the 51 daily cases recorded right before Thanksgiving, less than two months ago. Meanwhile, the University of Virginia Medical Center has had to divert some patients to other hospitals because it did not have sufficient staff to care for them. That was caused by an earlier type of diversion: Many hospital staffers had been shifted to COVID duty to meet the demand for care. \u201cStaffing is critical to being able to treat patients, and as COVID patients increase in the hospital, we need to move our staff around,\u201d Dr. Reid Adams, interim chief medical officer for the hospital, told The Daily Progress for a Jan. 8 story. \u201cIf we don\u2019t have a bed or we don\u2019t have the staff available to take care of others, we may have to hold off on being able to admit them.\u201d Other hospitals in Virginia are facing similar problems, perhaps to a greater degree than UVa. But as other hospitals fill their beds or occupy their staffs with COVID patients, they have less capacity to absorb non-COVID patients. That in turn affects Central Virginians: If their local hospital can\u2019t take them, finding a hospital that can may be increasingly difficult. Then, as of Jan. 13, UVa also began prohibiting visitors \u2014 not just for COVID cases, but hospital-wide. Except in very special cases, visitors are being banned from inpatient units, the Emergency Department, outpatient clinics and outpatient procedural areas. These limits are an effort to help prevent the spread of the virus among both patients and staff members. Sentara Martha Jefferson Hospital tightened its visitation policies as of Nov. 20. All these indicators remind us that hospitals aren\u2019t the only ones who should be taking precautions. That responsibility lies with each of us. We\u2019re at a critical juncture. As the pandemic wears on and the self-sacrifices mount \u2014 cancelled visits with loved ones, lost jobs and reduced income, disrupted work and school routines, curtailed entertainments \u2014 it becomes harder and harder, emotionally, to keep slogging through such deprivations. The temptation to cut corners increases. So, for that matter, does the emotional stress \u2014 potentially leading to depression or outbursts of anger. At the same time, we are tantalizingly close to achieving widespread immunization through new vaccines. We must continue to hope that if we hold on just a little longer, we can overcome this pandemic. It doesn\u2019t help in that regard that officials have primed us with promises \u2014 promises that were unmet and served only to increase our disappointments. By now, we were supposed to be well along in the vaccination program. Instead, muddled supply programs have slowed delivery of the vaccines, unclear policies have left health-care providers to sort out distribution for themselves and other problems have delayed getting shots into arms. The problems start at the federal level, but Virginia was one of the states with a low rate of distribution relative to number of vaccines provided. Gov. Ralph Northam has since implemented new policies, swearing that Virginia will do better. Yes, it\u2019s been a long, hard pull \u2014 and we haven\u2019t turned the corner yet. As recent numbers suggest, the problem worsened in recent weeks \u2014 might get still worse before it gets better. But the alternative? Sacrifice the health and lives of loved ones because we\u2019ve run out of patience? We counsel caution, restraint \u2014 and courage. Better days are coming. Don\u2019t give up.","306":"University of Virginia officials on Friday said they will start the spring semester as planned on Feb. 1 with in-person classes but will limit gatherings to no more than six people for at least the first two weeks and possibly later. Requirements to wear face masks and to maintain social distancing will continue from the fall semester. The announcement came in a university-wide message issued by UVa President Jim Ryan, Provost Liz Magill, Chief Operation Officer J.J. Davis and Craig Kent, executive vice president for health affairs. \u201cThe university\u2019s knowledge about the pandemic and capacity to combat it through extensive asymptomatic testing, quarantine and isolation, and other measures have grown significantly since the academic year began,\u201d the administrators wrote. Returning students who lived on Grounds in the fall will move back into dorms beginning Jan. 29. All students must take a COVID-19 test with a negative result prior to moving in. All students, including those living in the surrounding community, will be tested each week throughout the semester. That includes graduate and professional students, as well as undergraduates. Officials said the school can better \u201cmonitor and govern compliance with public health measures\u201d of those students living off grounds if the school offers in-person courses. \u201cAfter completing a full semester in the fall, we have not seen any evidence of transmission within the classroom, between students and UVa faculty and staff, or from UVa students into the greater [community],\u201d the message states. \u201cWhile it was challenging, this [university] community has demonstrated that we are capable of complying with measures that limit the spread.\u201d According to officials, beginning Tuesday gatherings on and off-Grounds will be limited to no more than six people, down from the 10 allowed at the end of fall semester. Current state restrictions are also at 10 people. The six-person limit will be in effect until at least Valentine\u2019s Day when the administrators will review the policy. Last fall, UVa put a 10-person limit on gatherings, started a program of testing students even though they had no symptoms and developed a wastewater monitoring system for students living in dormitories. With some exceptions, students seemed to follow the restrictions and the number of COVID cases reported remained fairly low both on Grounds and in the community at-large. Much has changed since UVa classes let out for the fall around Thanksgiving, however. The area\u2019s percentage of COVID tests coming back positive has increased to nearly 10 percentage points and the state\u2019s rate has hovered around 15%. The number of the cases and average daily population of COVID cases at the UVa Medical Center have also substantially increased. The medical center recently banned visitors from hospital buildings, with a few exceptions, citing the increase in cases both in the community and being treated in the hospital. Although there is room in the hospital, the number of doctors, nurses and other staff members available to treat both COVID patients and other medical patients is a limiting factor in the hospital\u2019s ability to respond to the pandemic. That, officials said, is the reason behind limiting student gatherings other than classes and lab courses to only six people as well as increased testing. \u201cThe increase in the prevalence of the virus in Virginia and around the country, as well as reports of new, more contagious variants of the virus mean we must take an even more aggressive approach, as an institution and as individuals, to limiting the spread within our community,\u201d the email states. \u201cSimply put, our margin for error is narrower than it was in the fall. A successful spring semester will require even greater adherence to UVa policies around testing, masks, physical distancing, and gatherings. This includes those who have already had COVID-19, as well as those who have received a vaccine,\u201d administrators stated. \u201cIf you are unsure of your own ability to abide by these measures, most students have the option to study remotely from home.\u201d Administrators said those who have had and recovered from COVID or have been vaccinated against the virus need to follow the same guidelines as other students. \u201cFellow UVa community members have no way of knowing which people previously tested positive and which are putting themselves and others at risk by ignoring health and safety standards,\u201d the officials said. \u201cUniversal adherence will avoid anxiety and potential conflict.\u201d","307":"Dr. B. Cameron Webb, an assistant professor of medicine and public health at the UVa School of Medicine and the school\u2019s director of health policy and equity, will join the White House team as senior policy advisor for COVID-19 equity. The response team is to develop an effective strategy to equitably vaccinate as many people as possible, according to a statement released by Biden\u2019s communications team. The COVID team will also consider ways to increase testing and other methods of \u201ckey to changing the course of the pandemic.\u201d \u201cFor the past 18 months, I\u2019ve been inspired to seek greater service \u2014 motivated by the challenges facing my community,\u201d Webb said on his Twitter page. \u201cI\u2019m so humbled by this appointment to join the White House at such a time as this. Looking forward to serving & working for an equitable COVID-19 rescue and recovery!\u201d Webb ran unsuccessfully for Congress in the 5th District against Republican Bob Good last fall.

The health district will open its doors on Monday to emergency first responders, teachers and school staff who live in the district, which includes Charlottesville and Greene, Nelson, Louisa, Fluvanna and Albemarle counties. Also eligible to receive the vaccine are food and farm workers, manufacturing personnel, grocery store workers, public transit workers, mail carriers and package delivery personnel as well as anyone age 65 and older. The group is referred to as Phase 1B.\u00a0 \u201cWe are pleased to provide a safe and effective vaccine to frontline healthcare workers, essential employees, and individuals over the age of 65, as well as those with high risk health conditions\u201d said Blue Ridge Health District Director Dr. Denise Bonds in a statement. Anyone older than 16 with an underlying health condition is also eligible for a shot. Currently, the health district operates its vaccine clinic under a tent in the parking lot of the old Kmart at Emmet Street and Hydraulic Road. The clinics are not open to the public, but require appointments made through the health department either by employers or residents. \u201cWhile the vaccine provides hope on the horizon, it will still be months before the vaccine is widely available publicly. It\u2019s important to remember we are still very much in the trenches of this pandemic and we must continue to adhere to COVID-19 prevention practices,\u201d Bonds said. UVa will send some staff members experienced with administering the vaccinations to help the district increase the number of injections BRHD can provide during its clinic. The university medical center has had more than 600 employees volunteer to provide injections. That, hospital officials say, is one reason why more than 10,800 health system employees have received a first-dose of vaccine and more than 1,800 have received both doses since the vaccines first started arriving before Christmas. A single shot provides some immunity to COVID, but it takes two shots about four weeks apart to get 95% immunity. Although it will send people to man the needles, UVa will not be sending vaccine until its own staff has been inoculated. Dr. Costi Sifri, head epidemiologist at UVa, said the medical center has received enough shipments that it currently has a surfeit of shots, which will be used to provide initial inoculation and second-dose shots for other medical center employees. UVa and the health district follow guidelines set up by the Virginia Department of Health for administering the vaccines. The department has not set guidelines for transferring vaccine doses from one organization to another. \u201cWe\u2019re looking to the state health department to see if [the doses] should be used for other vaccinations or for second doses for staff,\u201d Sifri said. \u201cWe\u2019re continuing to vaccinate our employees and continue to look into how were going to move into the next phases in cooperation with the health district and Virginia Department of Health.\u201d Blue Ridge Health District officials say they currently are receiving regular supply of vaccine and transfer should not be necessary. Buckingham County residents, who live within the boundaries of the Piedmont Health District, will see shots made available for Phase 1B on Tuesday. Much like the Blue Ridge Health District, appointments are needed to receive the vaccine. Because the vaccine is a scarce commodity, the Centers for Disease Control has set priorities for some people to get their shots first. Those who have health issues, are over 65 or work in jobs categorized as essential are in those three groups belong in those phases. \u201cVirginians who do not fall into priority phases will be offered the COVID-19 vaccine when it is more widely available,\u201d Piedmont Health District officials said in a statement. \u201cOnce the vaccine is rolled out to the general public, distribution will be similar to the flu vaccine.\u201d There is no timeline for when the vaccine will be available through pharmacies, doctor's offices and other locations that provide annual flu shots. Estimates from state and federal officials have ranged from three months to late summer. Until that time, officials recommend people wear masks, stay socially distant and avoid social situations with people who are not living in their immediate family. Although the last two months have seen COVID cases increase at UVa Medical Center to the point that officials banned visitors in most instances, officials said the past week has seen the numbers drop enough to give them breathing room. Lower numbers of COVID patients mean nurses, doctors and other frontline care staff can be moved into their normal units to provide care for other patients. More COVID patients mean staff must be borrowed from other units, sometimes forcing the hospital to redirect transfers and other patients to hospitals around the state. \u201cThis week we\u2019ve had a stable number of patients and as a result of that, we\u2019ve been able to continue with regular care,\u201d said Dr. Reid Adams, interim chief medical officer for the hospital. \u201cWe\u2019re in quite good shape as far as being able to care for patients. We\u2019re still having incredible stress on the system, but we\u2019ve been dealing with that for a long time.\u201d The state health department also announced this week that it had expanded its partnership with the Walgreens national pharmacy chain to operate drive-through, no-cost COVID-19 testing in 15 stores. None of those stores are in Central Virginia.","309":"Albemarle County Public Schools is sticking with a plan to look at COVID-19 data on Wednesday, Jan. 27 and decide whether to reopen in-person classes to some students. Teachers, parents and School Board members asked the division Wednesday for less back-and-forth about the status of in-person learning. Division spokesman Phil Giaramita said that after two weeks of all-virtual classes that start Tuesday, the division will look at the COVID-19 data and decide whether to restart Stage Three, which allows for preschoolers through third-graders to have in-person classes twice a week. \u201cThe numbers always are driving this, but we are not anticipating at this point that we will be in Stage 1 for an extended period of time,\u201d Giaramita said. \u201cIn fact, it's conceivable that January 27 may be the only time this issue comes up.\u201d As of Friday, only school divisions in Greene and Fluvanna counties are offering in-person instruction. With 1,742 new cases reported so far, January has been the second-worst of the pandemic. The health district\u2019s positivity rate has also started to decline after reaching a recent high of 10.5%. Earlier this week, schools Superintendent Matt Haas announced the switch back to all-virtual classes \u2014 three days after in-person classes resumed following a winter break hiatus \u2014 and said that the decision to resume Stage Three would be made every Wednesday starting on Jan. 27 until students were back in the buildings. That\u2019s a different decision from whether to expand in-person classes to all students, which board members also discussed during Thursday\u2019s meeting. Speakers at Thursday\u2019s School Board said that the recent changes in classes were disruptive and made it difficult to plan for childcare. \u201cWhat I heard from some of those parents, and what I've experienced, is just so much fluctuation in what we're doing is almost impossible to stay on top of it,\u201d board vice-chairwoman Katrina Callsen said. School Board member Judy Le echoed those concerns. \u201cSometimes that flexibility of thinking of things week to week, just within the three to one, is harder for parents and caregivers who have less flexible jobs, and I know that we have a lot of those,\u201d Le said. Haas said his goal is to get students into the buildings whenever they can, adding that the new guidance from the state supports that stance. \u201cThe direction from The Virginia Department of Education, which I agree with, is that we should take every inch we can get to bring children into schools who want to be there,\u201d he said. On Thursday, the Virginia Department of Education said that school reopenings during the fall have shown that in-person classes can be offered safely if several factors are in place, such as a mask requirement and social distancing. Additionally, school officials were told to take into account how the virus\u2019 spread in a community was affecting their ability to offer classes. The state has still left the decision in the hands of local officials. Jessica Maslaney, CEO of the Piedmont Family YMCA, said the changes have made it challenging to plan for virtual learning centers. The organization is serving 120 Albemarle County students at its Brooks Family center as well as 80 children in its early learning program. \u201cOur challenge is that frequent movement between stages makes it very difficult for our staff to plan and support synchronous and asynchronous learning and for us to maintain isolated \u2018pods\u2019 of 10 children to limit cross-contact,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is also very disruptive for students and staff. It is affecting our staffing, when we cannot guarantee consistent employment with week-to-week schedules.\u201d Maslaney also described her experience as a parent of a second-grader and the schedule changes during the second quarter \u2014 the first with in-person instruction. \u201cDuring this second quarter, she has only attended nine days of in-person instruction and as an 8-year old, has had to navigate a complex constantly changing schedule, never able to settle into a routine,\u201d she said. Malsaney requested that the division reconsider the week-to-week decision making and identify a reopening stage to stick with. Haas acknowledged that the fluctuation in stages can be disruptive. \u201cIt\u2019s been a yo-yo here recently, and that wasn\u2019t the intention,\u201d Haas said. 'We failed them' During a lengthy public comment period for which 35 people signed up to speak, parents, teachers and students weighed in on plans for classes this winter. As in past reopening debates, speakers used different studies to show that schools are either safe or not safe during the pandemic. \u201cEarly caution was understood but we know enough now to reverse course,\u201d said Matthew Winkler, a Western Albemarle High School parent. \u201cThe risk of not going back presents our youth and families irreparable consequences.\u201d Haas has not yet decided whether to expand in-person classes, but the division is operationally prepared to move into Stage Four, according to a presentation at Thursday\u2019s meeting. Stage Four would mean in-person classes for all students, though frequency varies. Preschoolers through third-graders would have four days of class while fourth-graders and older would have classes twice a week. Instead of a decision for each quarter, Haas will now make a recommendation about expanding in-person classes when health metrics allow, though no specific metrics were mentioned. After his recommendation, the School Board will vote at a following meeting and then Stage Four would begin two weeks later. In a survey released last month, 61.7% of elementary families picked hybrid instruction while 54.7% of middle and high school families did so. Citing the same local statistics, parents and teachers disagreed about the risks of opening up schools. Parents argued that having in-person classes and other activities is safe with the proper mitigation strategies and that keeping students home will have negative ramifications. Teachers disagreed and urged the board to keep classes online until case numbers decline and more staff receive the COVID-19 vaccine. \u201cWhile I agree with the decision to return to Stage One for the next two weeks, I'm still apprehensive about how decisions for reopening will be made in the future,\u201d said Vernon Liechti, a government teacher at Albemarle High School. Liechti added that he was concerned about the return of UVa students next month and how they\u2019ll affect the COVID data, echoing a concern raised over the summer and throughout the fall. The testing at UVa did skew the area\u2019s positivity rate. Jessica Taylor, president of the Charlottesville Education Association, spoke in support of county teachers and encouraged division officials to listen to employee concerns in their planning process. \u201cGive them a seat at the table so that their perspective and their experiences at their worksites is capitalized on in building your vision for a return to in-person instruction,\u201d she said. \u201cI urge you to take action now to repair any confidence and trust that has been damaged so that you can maintain the high quality and committed workforce I enjoy working alongside.\u201d Jennifer Graham, a teacher at Walton Middle School, said she didn\u2019t expect that some of her students would not participate in classes virtually. Some students in middle school can come into the building for help including those who haven\u2019t been engaging with virtual classes. \u201cI feel like schools previously partnered to help kids raise these families,\u201d she said. \u201cWe failed them. We haven\u2019t been there to meet pragmatic needs.\u201d Graham said after visiting some of her students at the school, she realized they needed her and she taught virtually and in-person. \u201cThey were failing and needed help,\u201d she said. \u201c... A lot of them have parents who are working so they\u2019re left to their own devices during the day. A few of their parents didn\u2019t speak English. I heard parents break down because they didn\u2019t know how to help their kids.\u201d Jane Wiggins, a Western Albemarle parent who recently lost her father-in-law to the virus, said she was worried about how the effects of the isolation her children are experiencing. \u201cMy own teenagers\u2019 mental health is not in good state,\u201d she said. \u201c\u201cMy children are in their bedrooms \u2014 all day, every day \u2014 trying to receive an education over Zoom. \u2026 The real effects of the isolation may not be tangible to us right now but the long-term effects have serious implications for these students.\u201d Harper McQueen, a student, advocated for the division to stick with virtual classes. She said having students learning online and in-person is \u201cincredibly disruptive.\u201d \u201cAs much as I love to believe that my classmates will wear masks and always remember to social distance, I know that won't happen,\u201d she said. \u201c... I know many people who listen to politicians who denounce masks and even think that the precautions that were taken were blown way out of proportion. Knowing this, it isn't crazy to think many kids will try and protest the rules put in place for other people's safety.\u201d","310":"Thirmston Hern is no longer alone. The slave\u2019s name inscribed on the University of Virginia\u2019s Memorial to Enslaved Laborers was joined by five of his family members who also worked, mostly in historical anonymity, to build the university designed by Thomas Jefferson. Davy Hern, Fanny Gillette Hern, Bonnycastle Hern, Lily Hern and Ben Snowden were officially added in a private dedication held Tuesday at the memorial. All six were related to an enslaved family at Jefferson\u2019s home at Monticello and to Charlottesville native Myra Anderson. \u201cThirmston Hern\u2019s name was already on there when they completed the memorial, but there were several others from the family whose names should have been on there,\u201d Anderson said. The memorial was first proposed by students more than a decade ago and won support across the university community, including alumni. The memorial was seen as a way to acknowledge and honor an estimated 4,000 people who built and worked at the university \u201cI grew up in Charlottesville \u2014 all of my life and in school we never heard about slavery at UVa,\u201d Anderson said, noting instead that use of the word \u201cservant\u201d was prominent. \u201cWhen you hear \u2018servant,\u2019 you don\u2019t think of slavery. We never heard of slavery at Monticello, except for the Hemings family.\u201d The enslaved workers cleared land, dug foundations, fetched water and wood, cleaned and performed daily chores for students and professors, according to the memorial. These workers also included skilled laborers in cooking, brick making, carpentry, roofing, transporting and carving quarried stone, blacksmithing, and designing, sewing and creating clothing. In the fall of 2016, the UVa Board of Visitors selected a firm to design the memorial and construction began in 2019. A planned April 2020 dedication of the memorial fell victim to the COVID-19 pandemic. The official dedication has yet to be rescheduled as the virus has yet to abate. \u201cWe are honored to support families as they share their written and oral histories of their ancestors who were enslaved at the university,\u201d said Carolyn Dillard, of the Division for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion at UVa\u2019s Center for Community Partnerships. \u201cAnd it is a sobering, heartfelt process and an honor to work alongside of them to ensure the names of the enslaved are forever memorialized in stone and visible to all,\u201d Dillard said. The memorial bears the names of hundreds of known workers and blank-line \u201cmemory marks\u201d for the thousands of names still unknown. Some inscriptions are simply noted by job, gender or age. \u201cThere are inscriptions on there from people whose names aren\u2019t known or remembered. They have \u2018stonecutter\u2019 or \u2018boy\u2019 or \u2018girl.\u2019 There are just blank lines,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cWhen you think of slavery, how it denied humanity to individuals and degraded human beings into obscurity by denying them even their existence, stripping them of any dignity, you can see why it is important to put the names out there of people you can find.\u201d Thirmston Hern\u2019s name was easy to find. Because the family descended from slaves at Monticello, and because of Jefferson\u2019s compulsive note-taking, the other names of Hern family members who labored at UVa were far less difficult to discern than most. When Anderson discovered only Thirmston\u2019s name was on the memorial, she set about to rectify the omission. It took more than a year. \u201cWhen I looked up the information at UVa on slavery, they only had two PDFs but when I looked at the PDFs, my family\u2019s names were all over the documents,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure why they weren\u2019t included to begin with, but I wanted to make sure they were on there.\u201d The process took about 18 months. Anderson said she believes it was because of a lack of a defined process at the time for putting names on the monument rather than any type of stalling or reluctance on the part of UVa staff. Anderson got the final OK from UVa in December, along with an apology for the length of time it took. \u201cThis process of going back and forth with UVa officials was incredibly confusing and frustrating,\u201d Anderson recalled. \u201cAt times, I really wanted to give up but my DNA wouldn\u2019t let me. When you look back at slavery, at the segregation laws, racial purity laws, and eugenics and how long it took to turn those over, I\u2019m really the first generation of six generations of my family to have full rights, the right to drink out of whatever fountain or go into restaurants. That makes honoring my ancestors more important.\u201d Officials are hoping to work with descendants to identify the families of the enslaved. \u201cThe MEL Names Committee has been established by the university to support descendant families, researchers and genealogists,\u201d Dillard said. \u201cThe committee is comprised of university historians, genealogists, alumni, university architects and descendants.\u201d Names would be added each year, she said. \u201cIt is our desire to host an annual Descendants Day at the university where new names will be unveiled to the families and the community,\u201d Dillard said.","311":"Difficult decisions are ahead for the Blue Ridge Health District as officials figure out how to fairly allocate a limited supply of the COVID-19 vaccine. Starting next week, the health district will receive 2,950 doses weekly to administer the first shot of the vaccine, following a change in how the state doles out COVID-19 vaccines. Previously, allotments were based on requests from health districts; they are now based on population. \u201cSo we have to sit down and think about what an equitable way to distribute it to all of our localities is and how we can meet all of the various conflicting priorities that we have been given,\u201d BRHD Director Denise Bonds told the Albemarle Board of Supervisors. \u201cIt will not be an easy task, and people will be unhappy. I am very, very sorry. I wish that I had infinite supplies of vaccine, so that everyone who wanted one could get one now.\u201d Bonds said that figure will be the weekly allotment for the next four weeks but does not include the second doses people need to be considered fully vaccinated. The health district was notified about the new allocation Wednesday afternoon. The health district includes Charlottesville and Albemarle, Fluvanna, Greene, Louisa and Nelson counties. It was unclear Wednesday how the new allocation compares to previous weeks because the health district has not disclosed how many doses they have received from the state, at the request of the Virginia Department of Health. That lower amount comes as the initial weeks of the COVID-19 vaccine roll-out in the district have confused and frustrated community members. The roll-out also was complicated by the limited supply of vaccine doses as well as an accelerated timeline to expand eligibility. \u201cIt has been a challenging roll-out and for that we apologize,\u201d Bonds said at Tuesday\u2019s Charlottesville City Council meeting. Bonds said training people to become vaccinators limited their efforts at first, but that problem has been solved. Now, the primary issue is vaccine supply. \u201cThe barrier moving forward is the lack of vaccines,\u201d she said. Prior to Wednesday\u2019s announcement, the health district had set a goal to vaccinate 1,000 individuals a day at its facility in the former K-Mart parking lot, health district spokeswoman Kathryn Goodman said Last week, vaccinators requested three times the number of doses it will actually have to distribute, according to the Roanoke Times. The state received about 110,000 doses a week and officials aren\u2019t expecting that number to increase soon. Bonds said the health district received no additional vaccine doses this week but had enough to cover appointments. Hospitals in Virginia have administered 48% of all doses in the state while local health departments make up about 13%. Bonds said that the health districts in the state have received about 15% of the state\u2019s vaccine doses. \u201cI think there\u2019s some misperceptions in the community that the health department is sitting on lots and lots of vaccines, and we just aren\u2019t,\u201d Bonds said. Last week, 5,587 doses were administered. Since December, 14,677 people in the health district have received their first dose of either the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine, and 1,315 people have gotten both. PHASE 1b The health district moved to Phase 1b on Monday, after urging from Gov. Ralph Northam. Originally, district officials were expecting to move to Phase 1b by late winter. Included in that priority group are some essential workers, people 65 and older as well as those with underlying medical conditions are eligible to receive the vaccine. However, just because someone is eligible doesn\u2019t mean a dose of the vaccine is available. The move to Phase 1b doesn\u2019t mean that everyone included in the first priority group, 1a, has received the vaccine. Bonds said the health district will continue to work with frontline healthcare workers to make sure they can get vaccinated. Sentara Martha Jefferson Hospital will be helping with that goal as well. \u201cIt\u2019s challenging and we know it\u2019s very frustrating for some healthcare providers,\u201d Bonds said. CVS and Walgreens are vaccinating residents and staff members at long-term care facilities, a process that\u2019s taking longer than initially thought. \u201cWe don\u2019t think that all long-term care facilities will have their first visit, or even a complete immunization series, until March sometime,\u201d she said. Currently, all vaccine appointments offered by the health district through February are full. Bonds said the number of appointments depend on the availability of vaccine doses. \u201cIf you have appointments on the book and you have no vaccine, then you have to cancel and that\u2019s worse than having limited numbers,\u201d Bonds said. \u201cI think people would be happier knowing that they have an appointment in March, than if they had an appointment on Feb. 12 and I cancel it. Then, they have to be pushed out till May. That would make people really unhappy, so we\u2019re trying to make sure the expectations match the delivery supply chain.\u201d The 1b priority group originally included those 75 and older but Northam expanded that group at a press conference last Thursday. To help vaccinate those people, the health district partnered with the University of Virginia Medical Center, which took on the task of vaccinating about 5,000 people 75 and older who had registered in advance with the health district. That pilot program started this week but issues with the scheduling system created more confusion because the emails confirming appointments were blocked by spam filters. UVa resolved that issue Tuesday night. \u201cIt was a little rocky on the notification,\u201d Bonds said. \u201c... We just need everybody to have a little bit of patience. There are just going to be hiccups in the roll-out.\u201d Goodman said earlier Wednesday that thousands of individuals have been able to schedule appointments since the issue was fixed. \u2018Really frustrating process\u2019 During presentations to City Council and the Board of Supervisors, elected officials relayed concerns raised by their constituents, including the pace of vaccinations, availability of appointments and confusion about the online system. The state\u2019s vaccine management system allows eligible individuals to make an appointment at vaccine clinics outside of the health district they work in. Thus, people have traveled to as far as Harrisonburg after making an appointment only to find out it was canceled. \u201cI understand this is a really frustrating process for the public and we\u2019re trying to get as much information on our website and as much clarity as we can,\u201d Bonds said. \u201cI know people have tried to call the hotline and all they have gotten is a busy signal because they literally have received hundreds of calls over the last week.\u201d That state is moving to a new vaccine management system that should help with that problem, Bonds said. The district\u2019s COVID-19 hotline, which is also a resource for people to ask general questions and schedule testing appointments, has been overwhelmed recently and unable to handle the call volume, health district spokeswoman Kathryn Goodman said. To help with that, the hotline staff was increased from four to 15 over the weekend, and they moved to a larger location. That hotline number is (434) 972-6261. \u201cWe want to serve the community as best as possible, which means answering calls quickly, being able to answer their questions as quickly as possible, and making sure that we\u2019re connecting them to the right resources are providing the information they need,\u201d Goodman said. Another point of confusion has been the online survey the district used to build a list of eligible people who were interested in getting a vaccine. Some people who have filled out the survey have not heard back from the health district or thought that survey was scheduling an appointment. \u201cThe survey is the first step,\u201d Goodman said. \u201cIt is a way for us to capture information; it is not scheduling you for an appointment. \u2026 We will then follow-up when it\u2019s your turn to schedule an appointment, which may take a little while. It won\u2019t be immediate.\u201d Goodman added that the health district is aware not everybody is comfortable using a computer or has access to the internet. Calling the hotline is an alternative to filling out the survey. Overall, Bonds said it will take months to get enough people vaccinated in order to reach herd immunity. \u201cIn the meantime, we need everybody to continue to use all of those great mitigation measures,\u201d she said.","312":"One week after the Blue Ridge Health District said it would open up the COVID-19 vaccine to more people, officials are cautioning that vaccinating all those currently eligible will take months and require patience from the community. In a series of media briefings Friday, local and state public health officials sought to clear up confusion about the vaccination program thus far, outline plans moving forward and update the community about COVID case numbers. Although millions of people in Virginia are eligible to receive a shot, supply of the vaccine is limited. The state receives about 100,000 doses a week from the federal government. The vaccination process thus far has confused and frustrated people as health districts across the state deal with limited supplies, quickly training vaccinators, technology issues and evolving guidance from the state. Earlier in the week, BRHD medical director Denise Bonds apologized for the roll-out thus far. Bonds said Friday that health district staff are working to add more links and information to the website to help people understand the process. \u201cI think this press conference is really the start of us trying to be transparent about how we\u2019re providing the vaccine, and to answer questions to the community,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are working to make sure that everyone in the community who wants a vaccine gets a vaccine.\u201d As the Blue Ridge Health District works to roll-out the shot, the community is seeing a record number of cases, which has forced case investigators to triage who gets a phone call. \u201cBecause of the surge and the large number of cases, I do want people to understand that not everybody who tests positive will get a call from a case investigator at this point in time,\u201d said Bonds. \u201c\u2026 Right now we are really trying to focus on those individuals who test positive who are in high-risk groups or high-risk settings.\u201d Before, case investigators sought to call everyone who tested positive to provide guidance and to determine if anyone else was potentially exposed to the virus who would then need to quarantine. That contact tracing has been key to containing the spread of virus. The health district has reported 2,426 new cases this month \u2014 a record \u2014 as well as 55 new hospitalizations and 11 new deaths. Small gatherings have driven the surge, which started after the Thanksgiving holiday. The district\u2019s seven-day average of new cases and positivity rate have dropped in recent days, signaling that the surge could be beginning to taper off. The vaccine shortage means that the health district will receive 2,950 doses a week for the first round of shots. Although local officials didn\u2019t say how many doses they have requested or recently received, BRHD policy director Ryan McKay said the new allocation falls \u201csignificantly short\u201d of what the district could dispense in a week. McKay and Bonds said the health district has spent the last several weeks building the infrastructure \u2014 from hiring and training to staff to working out other logistics \u2014 in order to vaccinate several hundred people a day. In fact, the district is now able to vaccinate 1,000 people a day at its site in the former Kmart parking lot, which opened Jan. 6, and has set up similar fixed locations in surrounding localities. As of Friday evening, 35,000 people eligible for the vaccine in the 1b priority group have registered their interest via online surveys with the health district. That figure doesn\u2019t include everyone who is eligible as people continue to fill out the surveys and call the hotline to provide their information. In the district 19,371 doses have been administered since Dec. 15, and 2,128 people have been fully vaccinated, according to a state dashboard that officials have said is incomplete, and the University of Virginia Medical Center accounts for most of that total. The two vaccines approved for COVID-19 require two doses either three or four weeks apart. \u201cWould we like it to be moving faster? Absolutely,\u201d Bonds said. \u201cWe needed some time to get all of the resources in place.\u201d Other health districts have struggled to update the state\u2019s vaccine tracking system in a timely fashion, resulting in an apparent 585,000-dose gap between the doses distributed and those administered. Bonds said the health district isn\u2019t behind on that data entry, and that state has instructed local departments to catch up by this weekend. On Friday, Dr. Costi Sifri, director of hospital epidemiology for UVa, said the medical center had received 25,075 and given out 17,321 doses, which includes the second shot. About 22,693 first doses have been scheduled or administered. That includes about 4,200 people in the health district who are 75 and older. UVa is working with the health district to vaccinate that population, which includes up to 5,800 people. This week, 1,560 people 75 years or older received their first shot, officials said. \u201cWe stand ready to provide vaccine to our patients, to members of the community, to whomever as the Blue Ridge Health District wants us to,\u201d Sifri said. That pilot program kicked off with a system failure that resulted in several people not receiving confirmation emails telling them where to go for their shot. In fact, several of the confirmation emails were sent to one individual while others were blocked by spam filters. That issue was later resolved. Phase 1b The district opened up the vaccine to the 1b priority group on Monday, weeks earlier than originally planned after urging from federal and state officials. The group includes people who are 65 and older, those with underlying health conditions and a range of essential workers. Bonds said the move to 1b was made before she fully understood the severity of the vaccine shortage and how allocations would be limited moving forward. \u201cBut we feel like that\u2019s still the right decision because that is the group that is the highest risk of dying,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are prioritizing, particularly within 1b, those individuals over the age of 75 that really have the highest risk.\u201d As they figure out how to distribute the 2,950 doses, Bonds said that the district is taking into consideration the fact COVID-19 has disproportionately affected people of color. \u201cAnd we said, it\u2019s going to take months,\u201d she said. \u201cPlease be patient. We\u2019re going to try to use appropriate medical prioritization and equity as we develop all of our plans.\u201d The state has not yet released a complete breakdown of how many doses each health district is getting moving forward or how many they have received since the vaccine was first distributed in mid-December. That\u2019s one of several data issues that have hindered the state\u2019s vaccination program. The appointment scheduling system known as the Vaccine Administration Management System has been challenging for users and the health district. The system is from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and adopted by the state. It doesn\u2019t give individuals at the local level much control. To fix that issue, the state is piloting a new registration system, which the district is piloting now. Vaccine Plans Currently, all appointments posted through February are full and the health district staff held off opening up more slots until they knew more about the availability of the vaccine. Bonds said that individuals who have secured an appointment over the next two weeks will still receive a shot. The state dashboard doesn\u2019t show how many people in the first priority group \u2014 frontline healthcare workers and long-term care facilities \u2014 have received the vaccine, but Bonds said they are continuing to prioritize that group despite the expansion to 1b. The health district is working with Sentara Martha Jefferson Hospital to vaccinate those left in the 1a group. The hospital will reach out to providers who are registered with the health district and schedule appointments. After the hospital has exhausted its vaccine stock, Bonds said the district will hold vaccine clinics just for 1a providers. All of these plans, however, are contingent on supply of the vaccine. To ensure doses of the vaccine aren\u2019t wasted, Bonds said the district has a list of people in 1a as well as people who are high-risk and in 1b that they use if someone doesn\u2019t show up to an appointment. \u201cWe do have the rare no-show,\u201d she said. Eventually, people will receive an email telling them how to sign up for an appointment, but that notification could take months as district staff members work through the list. A mix of 1a and 1b individuals are receiving shots at the Kmart site, and the health district is looking to host vaccine clinics for specific organizations and employers who fall in 1b such as schools, day cares, migrant farm workers, homeless shelters and correctional facilities. That will free up space at the Kmart site when more vaccine doses are available. For people 65 and older and as well as those with high-risk medical conditions, the district is planning to allocate specific days at clinics when they can get vaccinated. The district is continuing to ask people in either priority group to fill out an online survey, which is the first step to getting the vaccine. Those surveys are available at vdh.virginia.gov\/blue-ridge\/covid-19-vaccination. Individuals can also provide their information via the district\u2019s COVID-19 hotline, (434) 972-6261.","313":"It\u2019s times like these that make monsters for the ages. As the world struggles with the COVID-19 pandemic, from how to slow its spread and how to stop it to those who question whether it\u2019s real, it may be difficult to imagine how humans a thousand years ago would relate to a deadly virus neither seen nor imagined. Actually, it\u2019s not hard. Their method is on TV, movie screens and a plethora of paperback books and pulp novels. It\u2019s the vampire. \u201cWe really don\u2019t know how old the vampire is, but the earliest mention comes from an old Russian text from about 1047 AD,\u201d said Stanley Stepanic, an associate professor of Slavic languages and literature at the University of Virginia and an authority on vampires. \u201cThat\u2019s the first time \u2018vampire\u2019 appears in writing, but we would estimate that it was around 200 to 300 years or more before that.\u201d Stepanic not only knows about vampires, but for a dozen years he\u2019s taught a popular course at UVa, called \u201cDracula.\u201d The original vampire was not shiny, sparkly or sensual and lacked the knack for precision, high-speed driving as seen in the movies. They were not sexy. They were not classy. They were not well-dressed. Neither were vampires principled or aristocratic. They were not cultured or controlled by an undead hierarchy hidden on the outskirts of society like so many novella vampires. Nay, they were nasty, blighted bringers of disease and death created by a culture bereft of knowledge yet fraught with myriad maladies. And, like the evil protagonist in the Harry Potter stories, you didn\u2019t just call He Who Must Not Be Named by name. \u201cThe oldest word we have for a vampire is upir and it was a euphemism. It meant \u2018the thing present at the sacrifice.\u2019 The upir was an entity and you didn\u2019t want to refer to it directly,\u201d Stepanic said. \u201cYou didn\u2019t want to call it by name because you might summon it. Language has power.\u201d The upir was developed through the need of people with no knowledge of microbiology to explain the sudden onset of disease and onslaught of epidemics as well as deaths, injuries and bad luck. \u201cIn the original Slavic beliefs, the vampire was a symbol for disease,\u201d Stepanic said. \u201cThe pandemic is caused by a virus and we know that, but we\u2019re talking about a time when viruses were unknown. We know about microorganisms and how to deal with them, but they had no idea. Imagine the primal fear of something you had absolutely no understanding of or control over: That\u2019s where the vampire came from.\u201d Exactly what created the upir concept is anyone\u2019s guess. The night creature developed in a time when few people could read or write and the wanton and random incidents of life and nature were easier explained by evil spirits and divine retribution. Death in childbirth and infancy were often attributed to the reanimated corpse that came back for vengeance for any number of perceived slights and, sometimes, just at random. Livestock losses, accidents and disasters were part of its realm. \u201cIf you look back at that time, and we\u2019re talking 800 AD or before, all they had were herbs for medicine and the world was a pretty terrifying place,\u201d Stepanic said. \u201cYou need to have some way to take control.\u201d Over the decades, scholars have suggested everything from porphyria to pellagra to rabies may have created the monster. It\u2019s rabies that many, including Stepanic, think is the most likely culprit. For instance, the disease is easily transmitted by wildlife from raccoons to fox, bats to dogs and it is transmitted by biting. Rabies makes animals do odd and often aggressive things. Consider the frightening 2013 attack by a rabid bear that was thwarted by an Albemarle County farm worker\u2019s point-blank shotgun blast from the roof of a Gator utility vehicle. The 120-pound female bear attacked the Gator farm vehicle, biting one of the tires before pursuing the farmworkers. One climbed into the bed of the Gator and then onto its roof, toting with him a shotgun. The other man left the cab but set the park brake when the vehicle started to roll downhill. The bear climbed into the vehicle\u2019s cab and was getting into the bed when the man atop the Gator shot the bear in the head. It was the first-ever recorded case of a rabid bear in Virginia and only the second case on the East Coast. According to several scholarly treatises on vampires, which proliferate on the internet, symptoms of a vampire attack include nightmares, apparitions, and death by wasting away. The first symptoms of rabies, according to the Mayo Clinic, include flu-like symptoms such as fever, nausea, vomiting and cramps. Difficult breathing follows along with excess saliva production, difficulty swallowing, anxiety and fear of drinking water. Insomnia, restlessness, fear and avoidance of sunlight, hallucinations and nightmares, intolerance of odors, mental confusion, hyperactivity, aggression or paralysis precede a coma and then death. Like rabies victims, vampires bite, avoid sunlight and are repelled by strong odors such as garlic. To prevent the vampires from running amok in the village, research shows villagers would perform a variety of rituals mostly involving exhuming bodies and driving stakes through the hearts, chopping off the dead\u2019s heads and burning their bodies. In the 1700s, the vampire myth went worldwide in what is known as Serbia\u2019s Great Vampire Epidemic that created a rash of vampire-related deaths as well as graveside efforts to stop the night stalkers. \u201cDuring the Vampire Epidemic there is evidence there were entire villages that were abandoned because people didn\u2019t know what was going on,\u201d Stepanic said. The epidemic happened to coincide with another epidemic, one of rabies spread by rabid wolves and people. \u201cThere is a strong link between wolves and vampires and the werewolf is actually just an offshoot of the vampire myth,\u201d Stepanic said. \u201cVampires did not turn into bats originally, but they could turn into wolves.\u201d Western doctors knew of rabies and successfully debunked the vampire theory as it made its way into Germany and the rest of Europe via soldiers and travelers who had seen the vampire hysteria. Even New England had a vampire epidemic in the 1800s as tuberculosis, then known as consumption, made its way through whole families. From 1812 to nearly the end of the century there were reports of vampires in small towns. In 1892, an Exeter, Rhode Island the family of George Brown was decimated by the disease. In 1884, his wife died of tuberculosis. In 1886, his oldest daughter died from the ailment. His son Edward became ill and was sent to Colorado for \u201chealthier air.\u201d In January 1892, daughter Mercy Brown died of the disease and was buried in an above ground, stone crypt. A month later, Edward returned critically ill and superstitious townsfolk, many of whom were of Slavic descent, pressured Brown to exhume his family members for fear that \u201cby some unexplained and unreasonable way, in some part of the dead relatives body, live flesh and blood might be found, which is supposed to feed on the living are in feeble health,\u201d a newspaper report of the time states. In March, Brown agreed. All but Mercy\u2019s remains were skeletal, the story states. Mercy\u2019s body was well preserved, having only been two months in the stone crypt during the cold of January and February. An autopsy found blood still in Mercy\u2019s heart and liver, which convinced townsfolk that she was a vampire, despite a doctor\u2019s insistence that it was normal. The townsfolk burned her heart and liver and mixed the ashes with water. They used that to make potion given to the Brown\u2019s stricken son to stop Mercy from preying on him and cure his illness. He died two months later. \u201cWith our pandemic we\u2019re lucky because we\u2019ve got the vaccine and we\u2019re confident that life will be back to somewhat normal maybe this fall,\u201d Stepanic said. \u201cBut what if we didn\u2019t know what caused it? What if we didn\u2019t know about bacteria and viruses and what causes disease? What if this was something we had no control over at all? I think we\u2019d see people losing it and trying to find some way to explain what\u2019s happening. We might create some monster or another, something like vampires, to explain it for us.\u201d","314":"Webb will be President Joe Biden\u2019s senior policy advisor for COVID-19 equity. He will tackle issues of racial disparity in both the spread of the coronavirus and, especially now, the resulting fight against it. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control reports that Hispanic, Black, American Indian and Native Alaskan people have higher death rates from COVID, relative to their percentage of the general population, than do other groups. There is also reluctance among some groups to trust the government\u2019s efforts toward vaccination: In the past, Black and brown Americans were sometimes used as unwitting guinea pigs in medical experimentation. Currently, the fraught issue of equity is illustrated closer to home by the fact that in Virginia, the race or ethnicity of vaccine recipients has not been recorded in more than half of cases. Of course, health care workers\u2019 first responsibility should be to get shots into arms. But it\u2019s impossible to know if the vaccine is being fairly distributed among minority residents if no one\u2019s recording the data. Virginia\u2019s health-care workers need the clerical assistance to support them. The president\u2019s executive order mentions this problem (which is not unique to Virginia): \u201cThe lack of complete data, disaggregated by race and ethnicity, on COVID-19 infection, hospitalization, and mortality rates, as well as underlying health and social vulnerabilities, has \u2026 hampered efforts to ensure an equitable pandemic response.\u201d Data collection is one of the specific missions of the task force, along with appropriate education for minority communities regarding COVID, efforts to work with state and other entities to address issues, and other efforts aimed at equity. Data collection is only one of what must be scores of problems scattered across the country. Webb\u2019s task will be to identify and help solve them. He\u2019s well suited for that task. The University of Virginia physician (who also holds a law degree) has been treating COVID patients while also serving as founding director of UVA\u2019s Health Equity, Law and Policy Research Laboratory and as a core faculty member at the university\u2019s Equity Center. He also has prior government experience. In 2016, he was a White House Fellow under President Barack Obama and then-Vice President Biden. He served on the My Brother\u2019s Keeper task force and the White House health-care team through the Office of Cabinet Affairs. He worked through the transition period as Donald Trump took office, then returned to UVa \u2014 from which he had received his bachelor\u2019s degree \u2014 to take up his post with the medical school. \u201cContaining the coronavirus pandemic is one of the defining challenges of our time,\u201d said Vice President Kamala Harris about the broader mission of the task force, which she described in part as \u201chelping get this virus under control, responsibly reopen our economy, and safely reopen our schools.\u201d Cameron Webb is well qualified to contribute to that important endeavor.","315":"University of Virginia students are returning to Grounds over the next few days, just in time for classes to kick off on Monday. Students began showing up Wednesday but most will have access to dormitories on Thursday and Friday with the majority of students expected to return over the weekend, UVa officials said. The return comes after COVID cases in the area, and the percentage of tests with positive results, have seen a steady decline from a high of 10.6% positive on Jan. 6 to 5.2% on Wednesday. Students returning to dormitories and those who live off Grounds are required to have negative results from pre-arrival COVID tests and will undergo weekly testing for the virus during the term, officials said. UVa President Jim Ryan announced the return to Grounds would go as planned in a written statement and video message to students last week. Officials said on Wednesday that the school remains \u201con track\u201d for a Monday opening. The university\u2019s administrators and health officials are holding a virtual town hall Thursday from 4 p.m. to 5 p.m. to discuss the coming semester. The event is open to the community. Registration is available on the UVa Return to Grounds website via a Zoom link in the body of the spring 2021 update. In his statements last week, Ryan said he felt comfortable opening classes for in-person learning after a fall semester saw no transmission of COVID-19 between students and faculty, staff or members of the local community. He said students were good at following social distancing guidelines and wearing masks, although there were a few reports during the fall semester of violations of anti-virus regulations. \u201cWe learned a great deal about this and we\u2019re in a much stronger position to respond to the virus,\u201d Ryan said in a Jan. 19 video statement to students. \u201cWe can now perform thousands of tests per day and we will be requiring every student to get tested once a week. We\u2019re also making regular testing available to our faculty and staff.\u201d Ryan said the university has added isolation and quarantine space for students who test positive and that students and staff have more experience with following and enforcing health and safety protocols. UVa is limiting on-Grounds gatherings to six people, with exceptions for classes and school functions. The limit, which is lower than the 10-person gathering limit set by Gov. Ralph Northam, will be in effect for the first two weeks of the semester and could be extended. Masks and physical distancing also are required and the university has placed restrictions on travel, visitors and some events. Students will not be immediately eligible for the COVID vaccination but will need to go through the same procedures as others in the community, officials said. That includes filing with the Blue Ridge Health District to determine at what phase they will be eligible for the vaccine and when to schedule vaccinations. \u201cPlease do not schedule a vaccine appointment unless you have received an email directly from [the health department] or UVa that it is your time to schedule an appointment. You will be turned away from the vaccine clinic if you are not eligible for a vaccine at this time,\u201d officials told students in a Jan. 21 message. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take time to vaccinate everyone,\u201d Ryan said in his videotaped message to students. \u201cIt remains incredibly important for everyone to keep following health and safety measures, especially mask wearing and social distancing in public, even if you\u2019ve had COVID or received the vaccine.\u201d","316":"State officials are providing more data about where exactly the state\u2019s 1,166,600 million doses of the COVID-19 vaccine have gone \u2014 six weeks since the first shipments of the vaccine arrived in the Commonwealth. About 60,400 of those doses have gone to hospitals, health departments and other health providers in Charlottesville and the counties of Albemarle, Fluvanna, Greene, Louisa and Nelson, which comprise the Blue Ridge Health District. The Virginia Department of Health updated the public vaccine dashboard Wednesday during Gov. Ralph Northam\u2019s press conference with the additional information. Statewide, hospitals have received nearly 60% of the state\u2019s doses. Northam said at the press conference that the state is going to play a larger role in the vaccination program amid frustration about the process thus far. The Blue Ridge Health District has received the third-most doses of any health district in the state \u2014 only behind Norfolk and Fairfax. About 53,900 doses have been shipped to nearby Central Shenandoah Health District. As of Wednesday, 26,330 doses have been administered within the district and 3,213 people have been fully vaccinated. However, figuring out how much of the supply remains and where it is is complicated. The state\u2019s dashboard doesn\u2019t say how many of the doses are for the first or second shots. Providers automatically receive the necessary supplies for the required second doses. The updated dashboard comes after the state started basing dose allocations based on population, rather than what each health department or hospital system requests. This week, the Blue Ridge Health District will get 2,950 doses \u2014 all of which are going to the health department. Northam said at the press conference that hospitals have been told to shift any unused first doses to other priority groups. About 28% of the state\u2019s doses are for second shots and hospitals have received most of them. University of Virginia Medical Center officials said last Friday that the hospital had received 25,075 first doses. It\u2019s not clear if all of those shots would show as doses administered in the health district. That\u2019s because not all of the employees at the medical center live in the health district. The state reports doses administered by locality of residence. UVa and Sentara Martha Jefferson Hospital received the first shipment of Pfizer\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine Dec. 14 and started vaccinating staff soon afterward. Officials with Sentara Martha Jefferson Hospital are not disclosing which doses went to which specific hospitals. The system overall has administered 31,601 doses, a spokesman said, and 48% of all Sentara team members have received the vaccine. Martha Jefferson is working with the health district and using its vaccine stock to vaccinate healthcare workers in the first priority group. Some of the district\u2019s 2,950 doses will go toward school staff. The Albemarle and Charlottesville school divisions are hosting a three-day, invitation-only vaccination clinic starting tomorrow at Charlottesville High School. That clinic is focused on staff members working in-person at a school building, those who have not been able to schedule an appointment or those who have one after Feb. 7, according to an employee announcement. Employees from both school divisions have volunteered to help run the clinic. In the announcement, Albemarle school officials said about 75% of employees who said they want to receive the vaccine have been able to secure an appointment. Beth Cheuk, spokeswoman for the city school division, said they were working to figure out how many city employees have been able to make appointments. Meanwhile, local vaccination plans continue to face technology glitches and other challenges. UVa Health said on social media Tuesday night that some employees who are part of UVa\u2019s academic division signed up for vaccine appointments, even though they are not currently eligible, and are asking them to cancel those appointments. \u201cEmployees who were eligible received emails inviting them to sign up,\u201d UVa Health spokesman Eric Swensen said. \u201cUnfortunately, misinformation and links have circulated on social media, and some UVa students, faculty and staff who are in phase 1c logged into our scheduling system and booked appointments. When employees arrive for vaccination, we ask them to show their employee ID badges and verify where they work. We don\u2019t give the vaccine if the person doesn\u00b9t work for UVa Health.\u201d On social media, UVa Health clarified that its vaccine scheduling system wasn\u2019t created to monitor for ineligible appointments and can be used by anyone with a UVa login. \u201cNursing, medical and affiliated training program students were the only students eligible for vaccination during Phase 1a,\u201d according to social media posts. \u201cAcademic students were repeatedly informed that they were not eligible for vaccination during this phase. Nonetheless, we have learned from social media posts that some UVa students ignored those restrictions and scheduled appointments anyway. They also shared registration links and invited their friends to sign up.\u201d Because of the limited vaccine doses, the state created priority groups \u2014 1a, 1b and 1c \u2014 to outline who should receive the vaccine first. Currently, shots are open to healthcare workers, long-term care facilities, some essential workers, people 65 and older and anyone 16 or older who has an underlying medical condition. To see which priority group you are in, go to vdh.virginia.gov\/covid-19-vaccine.","317":"Starting on Sunday, an empty store front in the Seminole Square shopping center will transform into the area\u2019s second COVID-19 vaccination clinic. The Blue Ridge Health District is partnering with the University of Virginia Medical Center on the new site. The district will continue to operate the tent in the former KMart parking lot. Both sites are staffed by UVa and health district staff. The Seminole Square location is in the former Big Lots and will be managed by UVa. Officials said the 25,000-square-foot facility has plenty of parking and is on a Charlottesville Area Transit bus line. The site will help to vaccinate people more quickly once vaccine supply increases. For this week, the health district received 2,950 doses of the vaccine but changes at the federal and state level could lead to more supply in the coming weeks. However, state officials weren\u2019t sure Friday what the exact amount would be. In the meantime, the health district is working to vaccinate remaining healthcare workers and some of those people in the phase 1b priority group. \u201cWe want to set realistic expectations,\u201d BRHD spokeswoman Kathryn Goodman wrote in an email. \u201cPhase 1A and Phase 1B combined is nearly half our District\u2019s population. Unfortunately, we currently have a very limited supply of vaccines. The demand for vaccine far exceeds our current supply. We likely won\u2019t be able to expand to begin vaccinating the rest of Phase 1B until at least March or April.\u201d Wendy Horton, the CEO of the medical center, in a media briefing Friday, said with the Seminole Square location, UVa will be able ramp up vaccinations over time. \u201cIt\u2019s a larger space and so we\u2019ll have the capability of providing more vaccinations,\u201d she said. \u201cAs long as we have the supply, that will be an efficient vaccination location and can really help bolster the vaccination efforts throughout our community.\u201d Horton said the location was picked with help from community members. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard to get into UVa and the parking is difficult and so we wanted to make sure that we had a location that was accessible and that many people can get to and so you feel like this is an opportunity for the community,\u201d she said. Great Eastern Management Co. provided the Seminole Square space. As with the Kmart location, Red Light Management and the Bama Works Fund provided funding and logistics support, according to a news release. The Quantitative Foundation and the private family foundation of Merrill and Jaffray Woodriff, along with other donations, also helped to make the site possible. JAUNT, Inc. and CAT will provide free transportation to and from vaccination appointments, according to the release. UVa has also partnered with the health district to vaccinate residents who are 75 and older, and 4,815 shots have been administered as part of that program. Dr. Costi Sifri, director of hospital epidemiology for UVa, said Friday that there are more than 6,000 people who have either been vaccinated or are scheduled to be. \u201cThat\u2019s been one of the most gratifying things that I think our vaccine team has been able to do since the launch of this project,\u201d Sifri said of that partnership. \u201c... The gratitude for our community members, our residents who are aged 75 years and older, who are coming in and getting vaccinated is just incredible\u201d Overall, UVa has administered 29,909 of the 46,150 doses it has received. \u201cThat\u2019s a total inventory and that includes the doses that are saved for second shot vaccinations,\u201d Sifri said. Both of the currently authorized COVID-19 vaccines require a second booster shot either three or four weeks apart in order to be most effective. A little more than 60,000 first and second doses have been sent to the Blue Ridge Health District since the vaccines were approved in mid-December, according to a recently updated state dashboard. Throughout the health district, 30,824 doses have been administered, and 4,063 people are considered fully vaccinated, meaning they\u2019ve received both doses. That count only includes people who live in the health district. CVS and Walgreens are responsible for vaccinating long-term care facilities and about 89,044 doses have been administered through that effort. Locality specific data is not available. The vaccine is currently open to frontline healthcare workers, people 65 and older, those with underlying medical conditions, and some essential workers. However, because of limited supply of the vaccine, vaccinating the 1a and 1b priority groups will take months, public health officials have said. Goodman said earlier in the week that the district is focusing on vaccinating the healthcare workers in the first priority group as well as people 75 years older and three categories of essential workers. Those include: police, fire and hazmat; corrections and homeless shelter workers and child care employers as well as teachers and staff at public and private schools. Charlottesville and Albemarle school divisions partnered to open an appointment-only clinic for school employees with a focus on those working in-person such as custodians and food service workers. School nurses from both divisions have completed necessary training to become vaccinators and are administering the shots. People who qualify for the vaccine as part of the 1b group should complete a pre-registration survey through the health district in order to provide contact information for when it\u2019s time to be vaccinated. Those surveys are only a first step and do not schedule appointments. The surveys are available at https:\/\/www.vdh.virginia.gov\/blue-ridge\/covid-19-vaccination\/ or by calling the health district\u2019s hotline at (434) 972-6261. All of the health district\u2019s plans depend how many vaccine doses are provided on a weekly basis from the state. To that end, state officials are continuing to change their approach to vaccinations in order to speed up the pace, including directing health systems to use vaccine set aside for second doses as first shots. That strategy relies on a steady supply of vaccine doses and requires the state to manage the vaccine stock to ensure that there\u2019s enough for those who receive a first dose to get the second round of shots. \u201cIt\u2019s an active management strategy really to address the buildup of inventory that was related to a slower rollout,\u201d said Dr. Danny Avula, the state vaccine coordinator, in a media briefing Friday. Avula said he\u2019s confident in the ability of the vaccine manufacturers to maintain and improve current production levels, especially after receiving regular shipments over the last three weeks. \u201cHopefully that\u2019s reassuring to providers who have not been moving their inventory,\u201d he said. \u201cIn some cases, we\u2019ve had places that have been holding on to inventory because they weren\u2019t sure if they can count on the federal government.\u201d The health district received 2,950 doses of the vaccine this week as part of a new state formula for divvying up the supply the state receives from the federal government. Initially, the district was told that figure would remain steady for the next month; however, the federal government said earlier this week that states would get 16% more doses. That announcement coupled with VDH\u2019s decision to use second doses as first shots will mean more supply for local health districts. However, that amount was unavailable Friday afternoon. Avula said the state was told Thursday night to expect 18,000 more doses next week on top of the 105,000 it received for this week. \u201cThat won\u2019t immediately translate to 18% more per locality,\u201d he said. \u201c... So we\u2019re still working that out. There should be a slight increase for all localities.\u201d","318":"The emails in President Jim Ryan\u2019s inbox painted a grim picture. The University of Virginia had decided to open its campus for the fall 2020 semester, despite the raging COVID-19 pandemic, and onlookers took to their keyboards, calling the move reckless. There will be blood on your hands, one person wrote last summer. \u201cAnd yet, here we are,\u201d Ryan told the university\u2019s Board of Visitors last month. It was the culmination of a semester in which no students and seven staffers were hospitalized and none died. But the university was far from unscathed. It endured 1,250 positive cases among students and staff between August and Thanksgiving, when students were sent home. The academic model was upended, and a community was fractured. Now, UVa is set to reopen its campus and begin the spring semester Monday. It starts miles ahead of where it stood in August, but it fears students and employees will behave with complacency as the promise of a vaccine looms. This is the story of how the University of Virginia got to this moment, told through the eyes of the vice president who rapidly designed an on-campus saliva testing protocol, the student who spent a month of his first college semester stuck in quarantine and the anthropology professor who transformed his lectures into podcasts in hopes of adapting to a new world of online education. The lab raceA text message arrived on Ram Ramasubramanian\u2019s phone, and the Apple Watch on his wrist began to buzz. It was late August, and Ramasubramanian, UVa\u2019s vice president for research, was driving his family to the Outer Banks for one last summer vacation. The message came from Liz Magill, the university\u2019s provost, and contained only two sentences: \u201cWhat do you know about saliva? Let\u2019s talk.\u201d Six weeks later, UVa had built its own on-Grounds COVID testing laboratory and instituted a massive saliva testing protocol. It was UVa\u2019s own Operation Warp Speed. During the summer, when universities began planning to return students to campus, they realized they needed to test their students to prevent outbreaks. Some universities contracted outside vendors. UVa and Virginia Tech built their own labs. UVa administrators considered several options. Nasal swabs proved too expensive, at $100 to $150 per test. Antigen tests were cheaper but not reliable. But a saliva PCR test, or polymerase chain reaction, was cheap, reliable and less invasive. Tens of thousands of samples had to be tested somewhere. Shipping them to a lab in Florida was one option. The other was building a lab from scratch. Ramasubramanian located empty space on the fifth floor of the Old Medical School building. But the lab needed to meet certain certifications. The refrigerator that stored the reagents had to be medical-grade. The electricity had to be backed up by a generator in the event of a power outage. The internet connection had to be secure to protect sensitive medical data. There was a fear it could take weeks, even months, to build such a facility. UVa did it in the span of a weekend, something Ramasubramanian called a miracle. UVa purchased tens of thousands of chemical agents, test tubes and pipette tips. It wasn\u2019t always clear there would be enough supply, so UVa purchased as many pipette tips as it could get its hands on. With a mandate of testing every student weekly, UVa expects to conduct 5,000 tests per day this semester. Ramasubramanian expects the university to have spent close to $10 million by the end of the year on testing, or $20 to $25 per test, which includes the cost of building the lab. The school\u2019s testing efforts didn\u2019t end there. It also conducted wastewater testing, where it sampled an entire dorm at a time. Staffers could tell if an outbreak was about to occur in a dorm before students felt symptoms. The university arranged for students to take saliva tests in the Central Grounds parking garage. There, they would drool, not spit, into a vial for three to five minutes, which proved awkward. Once 5 milliliters of saliva was collected, the vial was sealed in a baggie and shipped across campus by a specialized courier. There, lab employees tested up to 372 samples at a time. Staffers mixed the samples with other agents and repeatedly heated and cooled the mixture in a box that resembled a deep fryer. Ninety minutes to two hours later, the test finished. If lab technicians found millions of copies of COVID DNA in a sample, that meant the student had tested positive. They could determine a student\u2019s result in less than 24 hours. Staffers notified the state health department of their positive and negative cases. For each positive result, an employee would pick up the phone and deliver the bad news. The student, the caller would say, needed to prepare for isolation. Hotel Quarantine Jack Murphy, a first-year student, grabbed a pile of clothes, his skateboard, laptop, separate monitor and a bit of snack food. For the next two weeks, he would be living out of the Fairfield Inn, quarantining away from the student body and waiting to see if he developed symptoms. Universities across the state quickly realized the ability to quarantine sick and exposed students would make or break their ability to keep their campuses open. James Madison was forced to close when its isolation beds filled in a matter of days. Charlottesville-area hotels were empty, so UVa bought 600-plus rooms and sent students there to quarantine. On a late September day, a friend called Murphy to say he tested positive. The two had eaten lunch together at the Observatory Hill dining hall, and while they weren\u2019t seated particularly close, they had removed their masks for the meal. Murphy, 19, decided he needed to do the right thing. He needed to report his exposure to the university. He dialed the university\u2019s hotline, where he was told he would need to pack his things and go to a hotel near Grounds. The university offered a taxi, but his mother, who lives nearby, drove him instead. She arrived wearing two masks, and they drove with the windows down. Four hours after he called the university to inform them of his exposure, he checked himself into a top-floor room at the Fairfield Inn downtown. Three times a day, a meal arrived at his door. He got sandwiches for lunch and chicken or beef with sweet potatoes for dinner. There was always dessert. For the first week, he was stuck inside his room 24 hours a day. Then an indulgence arrived. Students living in quarantine who hadn\u2019t tested positive could leave their rooms for exercise as long as they kept their distance. Murphy grabbed his skateboard and rode in circles around the parking lot, jumping curbs for three or four hours a day. Academics barely changed, since his classes were online already. But Wi-Fi was spotty, and running his camera during Zoom calls proved too difficult. Staffers from the university\u2019s isolation and quarantine team and the department of health called frequently to check on him. There was ample time to fill. He took walks, did pushups on the floor and listened to podcasts. He listened to history podcasts, self-improvement podcasts, \u201cStuff You Should Know,\u201d and a podcast teaching him Italian. He only retained a little. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of time in quarantine,\u201d he said. While many UVa students behaved well, following COVID rules, a good number did not, he said. Students were visiting the bars on the Corner, socializing with one another and leaving the UVa bubble. The virus largely spread in small- and medium-sized gatherings where students didn\u2019t follow rules about masks and distancing, said Dr. Mitch Rosner, chairman of the department of medicine. Then administration cracked down, limiting the size of all gatherings, except classes, to five people. Students weren\u2019t happy with this decision, but good results followed. The number of cases shrunk as the semester went on. A university spokesman declined to reveal the number of students disciplined for COVID violations. But the judiciary committee announced it had adjudicated nine cases involving 43 students. No students were suspended or expelled. On the 14th day of quarantine, Murphy pulled the sheets off his bed, balled them into a big plastic bag and dropped it in the hallway. He disinfected every surface, scrubbed the bathroom and went downstairs, where his mother was waiting to drive him back to his dorm, Metcalf. But his stay in Metcalf was short. Two weeks later, another friend called to say he had tested positive. Exposed again, Murphy called the university and moved to a hotel, this time to the Home2 Suites. \u201cI felt like a fancy professional traveling everywhere for my job,\u201d he said. Spending a month of his first college semester in a hotel reminded him how much human beings need to be around each other. Sitting in one room all day, it was hard to focus on classwork. The simple act of stepping out of a chair, walking the halls from one class to another helped his mind reset. He\u2019ll emphasize that when the world gets back to normal. Murphy decided to move back to his dorm room for the spring semester. His roommate is staying home, and he has the whole room to himself. The \u2018bashpod\u2019 The podcast sounds like it was made by a professional. It begins with music, the rhythm of a drum kit and chords on an electric piano. A collage of voices from newscasts and politicians follows. Then professor Ira Bashkow begins talking. \u201cThis is the week where it gets really interesting,\u201d he says. An associate professor of anthropology at UVa, Bashkow converted his lectures to podcasts for his class, Anthropology 3275: The corporation: history, culture, capital. Bashkow has two college-age children, and he saw how they languished in never-ending Zoom classes. Students often turned off their cameras and checked out when lectures droned on. \u201cI could see the tragedy of being pinned to the screen,\u201d Bashkow said. So he put his lectures on podcasts and encouraged his students to listen to them while walking the dog or riding their bike. He bought a Yeti X microphone, which cost $175 and was paid for by his university budget. He downloaded Audacity, a free audio editing program, and he asked his musically inclined son, Elie, to create intro music. Bashkow ran his voice through filters to soften the sounds and moderate the volume. He got help from graduate students and recent graduates hired by the university to help professors redesign their classes for an online world. He watched YouTube videos about how to engage with remote students. Finding a quiet corner of his home to record his lectures was a challenge. He waited until his wife went to sleep or ran an errand, grabbed his notes and started speaking to his 45 students. He realized students enjoyed small moments of levity in the middle of lectures on 18th-century legal scholars. If the phone rang, he would say, \u201cAh, the phone is ringing, but that\u2019s not important right now.\u201d His son nicknamed the podcast the \u201cbashpod,\u201d and Bashkow started employing it. Shorter podcasts worked best, he realized, and he limited some to 15 minutes. But it took him an hour to edit, re-record an iffy portion and publish a 15-minute MP3 file on UVa\u2019s Collab website. Longer podcasts took hours to complete. When the semester ended, he asked students to evaluate the class, and their response was surprising. They graded Bashkow with exceedingly high scores. One student wrote that Bashkow took asynchronous learning to a new level. \u201cMy ratings have never been higher,\u201d Bashkow said. Students received the podcasts so well that Bashkow plans to keep some of them in his curriculum after the world returns to normal.","319":"It was a year so weird, so wild, so wacked out that it often felt like a twisted version of chess, with every move the wrong one and every piece out to pawn off the king and queen. Thanks to Ashburn siblings Lindsey, Melissa and Kevin Hart, two of whom are University of Virginia graduates, the fun of \u201cnow what?!,\u201d which defined 2020, can be relived again and again through their card game, The 2020 Game. \u201cGames have been a major part of our family ever since we were young,\u201d Lindsey said. \u201cWe were always coming up with our own games or our own twist to existing games. We once created our own version of Clue where the murderer was Oprah on the trampoline with a muffin pan.\u201d Similar at its heart to Cards Against Humanity, the game involves cards with fill-in-the-blank questions that are filled in with answer cards. The deck includes enough weirdness and literal game changers to make it the perfect way to remember what you wish you\u2019d forget. \u201cThe rules are pretty simple,\u201d said Kevin. \u201cPlayers will take turns drawing a question card that the other players have to answer. The player who drew the question card will be the judge, and the other players will choose their best, funniest, most-2020 answer card to play from their hand. The judge will select their favorite, and the winner gets one point and draws a Cure Card.\u201d That sounds like a nice, simple card game but remember, it\u2019s about the year that was. \u201cHidden in the deck of answer cards are Coronavirus Cards. These cards take up a slot in your hand and can\u2019t be removed without the help of a Cure Card,\u201d Lindsey said. \u201cThe Cure Cards are where things start to get crazy, in a good way. These are wild cards that can be played to mix up the game or give yourself an advantage.\u201d The game imitates life. \u201cWe have a Face Mask card that will allow you to discard Coronavirus Cards from your hand; an Asymptomatic Card that lets you spread your Coronavirus Cards to other players; and of course, the Vaccine Card \u2014 the Holy Grail \u2014 that makes you immune from Coronavirus Cards for the remainder of the game,\u201d Lindsey said. Unlike life in 2020, you\u2019re free to do it your way. \u201cWe wanted to keep the structure of the game flexible to allow players room to create their own house rules,\u201d said Melissa. \u201cYou can start with two or three Cure Cards instead, if you really want to get crazy and increase the amount of Karen Cards in circulation. She\u2019s our favorite Cure Card.\u201d Karen cards \u2014 how very 2020. \u201cThat\u2019s funny you bring up the Karen Card,\u201d said Lindsey. \u201cIt seems to be everyone\u2019s favorite, and ours too.\u201d \u201cKaren\u201d is internet slang that recently made the dictionary. It means \u201can obnoxious, angry, entitled and often racist middle-aged white woman who uses her privilege to get her way or police other people\u2019s behaviors,\u201d according to Dictionary.com, Wikipedia and Urban Dictionary.com. Karen, of course, has a male counterpart. His name is Ken. Like real life, however, in The 2020 Game, it\u2019s all about Karen. \u201c[The Karen Card] is played in a similar way to how the Karens behave. It can be used after all answers have been submitted but before the judge reads them,\u201d Lindsey explained. \u201cPlaying a Karen Card will swap out the question card for another at random.\u201d In life and in games, Karens disrupt play. \u201cThe result is that some of the answer cards played may no longer make sense with the new question, which usually leads to chaos,\u201d Kevin said. \u201cThe idea is that when someone plays a Karen Card, it should feel like a Karen just interrupted to cause a scene. It\u2019s easily one of the most entertaining, but frustrating, parts of the game.\u201d The siblings swear Karen was simply swiped from popular culture, not the result of anyone they met. \u201cThankfully, there was no particular personal experience that led to the Karen Card,\u201d Melissa said. \u201cOur goal was to capture that universally relatable experience of encountering one, and the chaos that ensures soon after.\u201d Like the year that was, The 2020 Game is unpredictable and fraught with insecurity and botheration. \u201cIt was important to us that everything stayed on-theme with 2020. We liked the idea of creating a time capsule of the year. We wanted every card to either represent a specific event or a relatable feeling experienced that year,\u201d Melissa said. \u201cWe knew we wanted to incorporate a lot of buzzwords and events from the year, so that\u2019s where we started,\u201d Kevin said. \u201cWe all loved Cards Against Humanity, so we initially built something that looked similar to a 2020 version of that. Once we had that framework, we added several different features to move away from that comparison and make something totally new.\u201d The \u201cnew\u201d played out in the Cure Cards. \u201cWhen it came to building the different elements of the game, we looked to the year for inspiration. Everything from COVID to Karen played a part,\u201d Lindsey said. \u201cA portion of the game is about trying to avoid your hand filling up with Coronavirus Cards. In order to do that, you need to collect Cure Cards such as hand sanitizer and face masks.\u201d \u201cThey came later in the development process, when we thought that it could be more fun from a gameplay perspective to participate in the action of, for example, social distancing, rather than having that be the answer to a question card,\u201d Melissa said. That cure is one of Lindsey\u2019s favorite cards. \u201cWhen you play it, you get to choose another player to sit out that round,\u201d she said. \u201cWe thought this would be a clever way to bring to life what it was like to live through 2020 into the game.\u201d \u201cWe were intentional about everything; the color scheme even includes the 2020 Pantone Color of the Year,\u201d Melissa said. Oddly enough, the Pantone color for 2020 was classic blue. According to Pantone, the color instills calm, confidence and connection and \u201chighlights our desire for a dependable and stable foundation on which to build as we cross the threshold into a new era.\u201d The color was announced in December 2019, which could explain why they overlooked puce. \u201cReally, it was less about the year being bizarre and more about us coming to the realization that we were living through a historic year,\u201d Kevin said. \u201cWe came up with the idea around halfway into the year. So many monumental events had already occurred. I mean we had the pandemic, the Black Lives Matter protests, Tiger King, a toilet paper shortage and don\u2019t forget the murder hornets! We knew this year was one for the books.\u201d Kevin said the craziness sparked the trio\u2019s creativity and the dormant desire to work together and do what parents everywhere beg of their children \u2014 cooperate. \u201cWe had always talked about how fun it would be to work with each other on some sort of project or business venture,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve come up with idea after idea throughout the years but never actually pursued one. All of us felt so passionate about The 2020 Game that we had to see it through.\u201d Besides their love of card games, the siblings share business sense. Kevin, a 2014 UVa graduate, works in product management for Netflix. Melissa graduated from the UVa McIntire School of Commerce and works for an international business consulting firm. Lindsey graduated from the University of Miami and works in marketing for a financial crime prevention organization. \u201cOur business education definitely helped us begin on a strong foundation, but of course we were also learning every day we moved forward,\u201d said Melissa. \u201cWe knew our ideal selling window would be before the holidays, so we had to start up our [company] and register our trademark as soon as possible.\u201d They sought and locate a supplier, finalized the game format and tapped a friend to help navigate the waters of selling on Amazon. \u201cWith my background in marketing, I knew we had to start working on a marketing plan, as well,\u201d Lindsey said. \u201cWe started setting up our website and social media accounts and looking at different methods of advertising. It was so exciting to see everything come together in the end.\u201d The year that inspired their game has apparently inspired sales, as well. \u201cI think it\u2019s a safe assumption to say that no one originally expected the pandemic to last well into the summer, let alone how far along we are now,\u201d Melissa said. \u201cEveryone\u2019s lives have shifted in one way or another. Even the fact that we had to create the entire game via Zoom and phone calls, that in and of itself is pretty bizarre.\u201d \u201cThere have definitely been a lot of interesting and wild events happening that would have made for great game cards,\u201d Lindsey said of the first month of 2021. \u201cWe have been happy to hear from our customers that playing the game provides a bit of lighthearted escapism for them despite how crazy things have been.\u201d","320":"The cocktail, created by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, has received U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval for use in treating COVID, but is now being studied as a possible preventative as well. \u201cIt\u2019s a phase 3 trial, which means we\u2019re testing in patients now,\u201d said Dr. William Petri, Jr., one of the trial\u2019s leaders at UVa. \u201cIt appears that the antibodies in the cocktail act as almost instant immunity.\u201d The study is also being conducted at other hospitals around the country. Positive results in the trial could convince the FDA to make the treatment available to prevent COVID-19 after exposure to the virus. Called REGEN-COV, the treatment received emergency use authorization in late November from the FDA to treat high-risk patients with mild to moderate disease. President Donald Trump received the therapy when he was hospitalized for coronavirus last year. The treatment is infused into the bloodstream and is meant to mimic an immune response to infection. It provides passive immunity in that the patient\u2019s body does not need to generate its own antibodies. \u00a0\u201cRather than waiting for your body to make the antibodies like with a vaccine, this is a shot of antibodies that immediately fight the spike proteins of the virus,\u201d Petri said. \u201cIt\u2019s not long-lasting like the vaccine, but it appears to prevent infections in people who are exposed to the virus.\u201d In early results from the study, the cocktail successfully stopped 100% of symptomatic COVID-19 infections among people who were exposed to the virus. It also helped those already infected but asymptomatic to limit the amount of virus in their bodies and led to quick recovery, usually within a week. It does not, however, provide lasting immunity from the virus. \u201cIt\u2019s like turning the clock back by giving you antibodies before your body can make them,\u201d Petri said. \u201cThe disadvantage, of course, is that it doesn\u2019t last but it lasts long enough to make a difference in the disease\u2019s outcome. Until we get everyone vaccinated, it gives something.\u201d The treatment is being tested as a way to help those whose family members contract COVID-19 or who are the primary caregivers for COVID patients. By boosting the person\u2019s immunity, the cocktail could prevent infections of family members and limit the virus\u2019 spread. \u201cIt\u2019s very effective at decreasing the severity of the disease and in a lot of cases it will prevent someone exposed from contracting it,\u201d Petri said. \u201cYou would still need to get the vaccine so that your body could generate its own antibodies, but this could be used as a stop gap.\u201d A non-published analysis by Regeneron showed that in about 400 trial participants, 186 people received the cocktail and none developed symptomatic COVID-19. Of the 223 who received a placebo, eight developed symptomatic COVID-19. Asymptomatic infections occurred in 15 of the antibody recipients and in 23 of the placebo recipients. Overall rates of infection, including both symptomatic and asymptomatic infections, were approximately 50% lower in the antibody group. The cocktail recipients had viral loads \u2013 the amount of virus in the body \u2013 significantly lower than those who who did not receive it. They also all recovered within seven days while 40% of those who did not receive the treatment had disease courses lasting three to four weeks. There was one death and one COVID-19-related hospitalization in the placebo group and none in the antibody group. The cocktail appeared to shorten the duration of viral shedding, the time when the virus is being manufactured in the body, which could shorten the time someone is able to spread the virus to others. In both of the test groups, subjects reported some injection-site itching and irritation, but no other reactions. The UVa research team in the Regeneron project is led by Petri and UVa COVID Clinic director Dr. Debbie-Anne Shirley. \u201cWe are profoundly grateful to the nurses and staff of the clinic,\u201d Petri said. \u201cWe\u2019re one cog in the wheel, but it\u2019s great that we can contribute to this whole response to the pandemic and our patients get a chance this treatment.\u201d","321":"The COVID-19 vaccine will be available in a few area pharmacies even as supply remains limited. CVS Pharmacy said this past week that it will begin administering shots in 36 stores across the state, including Charlottesville, as early as Tuesday. Meanwhile, Walmart announced that it will start vaccinating people at certain stores in Virginia, including at the Ruckersville location. The pharmacies are receiving vaccine doses as part of the first phase of a federal pharmacy partnership program. Doses of the vaccine are open to those currently eligible, which includes frontline health care workers, certain kinds of essential workers, people 65 and older and those 16 or older who have underlying health conditions. People can sign up at CVS.com or walmart.com\/COVIDvaccine, but appointments cannot be made until the vaccine doses arrive at stores. The Blue Ridge Health District, which is receiving 2,850 new doses each week, is continuing to work through the 1a and 1b priority groups. \u201cThe demand for COVID-19 vaccinations far exceeds the current supply,\u201d health district officials wrote in an update Friday evening. Because of that, the district is focusing on people 75 and older and three categories of essential workers in 1b: police, fire and hazmat; corrections, homeless shelter and child care employees; and teachers and staff at public and private schools. \u201cWith this limited supply, it will be March or April before BRHD is able to expand broadly to individuals 65-plus and 16 to 64 with high-risk medical conditions,\u201d according to the Friday update. The health district has previously said those groups make up half of the district\u2019s population. BRHD senior policy analyst Ryan McKay said the district is trying to expand its appointment offerings. \u201cThere are infrastructures in place to be able to provide that access,\u201d McKay said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a matter of getting more vaccine to be able to open up appointments.\u201d The University of Virginia and the health district recently announced the opening of a second vaccination center, in the Seminole Square shopping center, to operate alongside the tent in the parking lot of the former Kmart. January was the worst month of the pandemic for the health district, but McKay said at Thursday\u2019s Albemarle County School Board meeting that the surge appears to be over. That means the district can revert back to conducting a full case investigation for each positive test. Last month, investigators pared back contact tracing efforts to focus on those who were high risk or living in high-risk settings. \u201cIt\u2019s a sign that we are trending in the right direction as it relates to community burden and transmission,\u201d McKay said of the investigation change. \u201cSo at this point, we\u2019re very confident that we\u2019ve gone through our surge. We\u2019re moving in the right direction, and we continue to see lower case counts throughout our district, particularly in Charlottesville and Albemarle.\u201d In the last seven days, the district averaged 61 new cases a day, a sharp drop from a mid-January daily high of 148 new cases. About 41,656 doses have been administered and 6,914 people are fully vaccinated, meaning they\u2019ve received both doses of the vaccine. In the last week, 10,832 doses were administered, which was fewer than the week before. Vaccination clinics were canceled last Sunday and Monday because of the winter storm that dumped about four inches of snow on the area. The health district and other community partners are vaccinating individuals at community-based or focused clinics, which are open by appointment only. The first step to making an appointment is filling out an intent survey through the health district, which is available at vdh.virginia.gov\/blue-ridge\/covid-19-vaccination. Individuals also may call the district\u2019s hotline at (434) 972-6261 to provide the necessary information. Since December, 66,350 doses have been shipped to the health district, which includes materials for the second round of vaccinations. The state\u2019s dashboard doesn\u2019t say how many of those are for first doses. At the UVa Medical Center, some 32,643 doses of COVID vaccine have been pushed into arms, including 22,673 people who received their first dose and 9,970 people who have received both doses, officials said Friday. Health System employees also have helped the BRHD to administer 8,263 doses of vaccine, officials said. Employees, including Dr. Costi Sifri, director of hospital epidemiology at UVa, were assisting the health district on Friday to administer the vaccine to people who qualify in phase 1a. But officials say that, even with an estimated 5,200 students attending a mix of online and in-person classes at the university, there are no plans to give them vaccines until others prioritized by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Virginia Department of Health have had their shots. \u201cThey\u2019re not likely to be at the top of the list soon,\u201d said Sifri, who joined a Health System virtual news conference Friday from the vaccination clinic. \u201cIf there was vaccine supply available for everyone, there would be a decision to vaccinate students.\u201d UVa students began in-person classes for the current semester Monday. Sifri said some students may qualify for vaccines through other phases of the rollout but a program to give all students shots is not currently in the mix. \u201cAll vaccination efforts are being done by the health department, and the Blue Ridge Health District is the group directing the effort locally,\u201d he said. Sifri said university officials believe that students will follow public health guidelines this spring semester to decrease the spread of COVID as they did in the fall. UVa officials have based opening the school up for in-person classes on last fall\u2019s performance. \u201cPublic health efforts like mask wearing and social distancing and very frequent testing were effective in the effort to limit transmission of COVID at the university,\u201d Sifri said. \u201cOur testing has been ramped up so all students, not just those living in dorms but off Grounds, as well, are being tested on a weekly basis. Those efforts combined should help mitigate transmission.\u201d Sifri said contact tracing and studies of the fall semester showed little transmission in classrooms and almost none between students and the community at large. \u201cWe anticipate having a very successful year and a committed student body,\u201d he said.","322":"Pinkston ran for the council in 2019 but did not secure enough votes during the Democratic primary to make the ballot. This time around, he said he is confident that his varied skills and previous experience running for office will propel him to the ballot. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to lose, but the thing that I most missed was the opportunity to serve the city,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cIn the last 18 months, I\u2019ve been trying to think through what are other ways I could serve the city or serve more generally, even beyond the city, and this opportunity came back around.\u201d After receiving encouragement from some civic leaders within the city, Pinkston said he decided the time was right to run again as a Democrat. The four-year terms of Mayor Nikuyah Walker and Councilor Heather Hill end this year. Walker has announced she will seek re-election, while Hill has not yet made her intentions known. Pinkston received a bachelor\u2019s of science in medical engineering from the Georgia Institute of Technology, a master\u2019s in philosophy and religious studies from Biola University and a Ph.D. in philosophy from UVa. His previous work experience includes serving as a senior technical engineer for Procter & Gamble and various project management positions within UVa, where he has worked since 2004. Though the world has changed a great deal since he last ran, Pinkston said he thinks he still brings a unique mixture of empathy and compassion mixed with technical, business and project management expertise. He said he also believes he would work well with the three councilors whose seats are not up this year: Sena Magill, Michael Payne and Lloyd Snook. \u201cNow, more so than before, I have civic experience, having served on some boards and running for City Council. Last time was, quite literally, education,\u201d he said. \u201cOf the three counselors who will remain \u2014 Payne, Magill and Snook \u2014 I got to know them all very well when I was running last time and in the primary and I really admire them and think that we would work well together.\u201d In a Facebook post announcing his candidacy, Pinkston highlighted several priorities, including: managing the fiscal crunch caused by COVID-19; working to make Charlottesville more affordable; and supporting schools and businesses during the changing landscape. Pinkston\u2019s announcement follows that of Juandiego Wade, who kicked off his candidacy as a Democrat last month. Wade, a member of the city\u2019s School Board, has said he wants to focus on criminal justice reform, investing in affordable housing, supporting public education and economic recovery following the coronavirus pandemic. The Democratic primary is currently set for June 8.","323":"The more infectious UK variant of the COVID-19 virus has been identified on the University of Virginia grounds, officials confirmed on Friday. The discovery comes as the school sees a surge of 145 COVID cases diagnosed since Monday among staff and students, according to the university\u2019s COVID tracker dashboard. Of those 145 cases reported this week, 138 were students. As Friday, there are 222 active COVID cases at UVa according to the website with an average of 36 new cases per day. University officials said the variant\u2019s discovery was expected. \u201cAs we anticipated this semester, we have confirmed that there are cases of the B.1.1.7 coronavirus variant, also known as the UK variant, in our community,\u201d the officials wrote in a message to the UVa community. \u201cThe primary difference between this variant, which is now present in 37 states, and the original strain of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, is that the UK variant is more contagious,\u201d officials said. \u201cWe are also experiencing a troubling rise in positive cases in our student community, distributed widely between on-Grounds and off-Grounds residents.\u201d On Feb. 8, UVa officials locked down the Gibbons residence hall for 24 hours after 17 COVID cases were identified in the dormitory. Students and resident staff were told to stay in their rooms while another round of tests was administered. As of Wednesday night, 15% of UVa student COVID isolation beds and 22% of quarantine beds were occupied. UVa officials said they will keep a 6-person limit on gatherings at the university and could move all classes online, should conditions worsen. They could also limit student ability to travel off of Grounds as well as around Grounds. \u201cIf cases continue to increase, our isolation and quarantine capacity will become strained and we will be forced to consider stricter measures,\u201d the officials wrote. COVID variants first discovered in the United Kingdom, South Africa and Brazil are mutant versions of the original SARS-CoV-19 virus. The variants make it easier to transmit between people and help it evade antibodies. The UK and South African variants have previously been found in Virginia. Although there has been no official finding of it, many health officials believe it is likely the Brazilian variant may have also found its way to the region. According to the Centers for Disease Control, the new virus strains appear to be susceptible to the vaccines now being distributed. \u201cSo far, studies suggest that antibodies generated through vaccination with currently authorized vaccines recognize these variants,\u201d health officials said on the CDC website. \u201cThis is being closely investigated and more studies are underway.\u201d The CDC indicated that there is no evidence that the new variants, although more easily transmitted, are more virulent than the original COVID-causing virus. The centers are studying the variants to determine if they change how the disease progresses in patients and whether existing drugs and therapies are still effective. At a Friday morning virtual press briefing, prior to the announcement of the UK variant being found on Grounds, UVa Health officials said the variants were to be expected. \u201cThey\u2019re in the U.S.. They\u2019re in Virginia. We should prepare and anticipate that there will be variants here,\u201d said Dr. Costi Sifri, director of hospital epidemiology at UVa Medical Center. Also on Friday, the Blue Ridge Health District, which had been providing pre-registration for persons trying to arrange COVID vaccine appointments, shut its system down at 5 p.m. in order to transition to a new system. The information gathered so far is set to be transferred to the Virginia Department of Health\u2019s new statewide registering system that will go online at 8 a.m. on Tuesday. Wait lists from local districts are supposed to be imported into the new statewide system over the weekend with pre-registration temporarily shut down until the state system is up and running. The move comes as the state health department attempts to centralize the process of registering for and getting vaccines as it doles out doses to hospitals, health systems and pharmacies. An estimated 3,000 vaccine doses are allocated to the Blue Ridge Health District each week. The district includes Fluvanna, Louisa, Greene, Nelson and Albemarle counties and the city of Charlottesville. According to the website, the district is only vaccinating individuals in Phase 1a, which includes frontline healthcare workers, plus limited selections from Phase 1b, including first responders, and people older than 75. \u201cWe are not scheduling appointments for anyone else right now. Due to a limited vaccine supply, it will be March or April before we open to vaccinate the rest of Phase 1b,\u201d the website states. Others in Phase 1b are those who work in corrections, food and agriculture, the U.S. Postal Service, manufacturing, grocery stores, public transit, teachers and child care workers. Phase 1b also includes persons between 16 and 64 years old with medical conditions that increase the risk for severe COVID-19 and those between 65 and 74 years old. Phase 1c includes those in transportation, utilities, food service, construction, finance, information technology, communications, law, news media, engineering and public health. According to the state health department\u2019s website, it could some time before those already registered to get the vaccine can get an appointment. \u201cIt may be weeks or longer before vaccination appointments become available for those who have pre-registered,\u201d the department\u2019s website states. \u201cAt this time, there is no set date for the start of Phase 1c.\u201d CVS Pharmacies began distributing vaccines supplied by the state with the Fifth Street store in Charlottesville being the local center. Appointments must be made prior to receiving a shot and can be made online or by calling (800) 746-7287. As of Friday, the first day the vaccines were available, all appointments were booked. Sentara Health Care, a statewide and regional nonprofit corporation which owns Martha Jefferson Hospital and many family practices and other health clinics in the region, announced earlier this week that it would not be providing vaccines for its patients. \u201cThe Commonwealth of Virginia has begun to prioritize vaccine distribution to local health departments rather than hospitals and health systems,\u201d Sentara officials said in a statement. \u201cWe encourage everyone, including Sentara patients, to explore every available avenue to receive a vaccine and take the first available opportunity. These opportunities could include non-Sentara clinics hosted by local health departments, neighborhood pharmacies, or other healthcare organizations. It is unlikely that Sentara will receive enough vaccines to offer appointments to all of our patients at this time.\u201d Federal health officials have suggested that it could be July or August before vaccines are available for all Americans who want one. In the meantime, local health officials are recommending area residents continue to wear masks and avoid gatherings, especially in the face of new variants. Sifri said that the number of COVID cases being reported, the percentage of tests with positive results and the number of people hospitalized with the virus have all decreased in the area as in the state and country. That, he said, should not lull people into relaxing their guard. \u201cWhat we really need to do is double-down and really focus on what [limits] COVID and that\u2019s wearing masks, social distancing and hand washing,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is not the time to become lax on mask wearing. It\u2019s not the time to reduce our precautions.\u201d","324":"The site was very well organized and staffed with multiple volunteers. Everyone was extremely friendly, took our temperatures and directed us to the check in stations, which were clearly marked and well organized. Along the way, many people thanked my husband for his military service (he had his Navy ball cap on), which was very much appreciated. The nurse who administered the shot was very friendly and did an excellent job of giving the vaccine. We were then directed to an area to wait 15 minutes to make sure that reaction to the shot before we left. So many heartfelt thanks to University of Virginia Health for organizing this event, and many, many thanks to the volunteers who provided such a wonderful and vitally important service. We appreciate all who contributed to this. Well done! D. Karen Hartranft Albemarle County","325":"RICHMOND \u2014 Virginia recorded 1,539 new COVID-19 cases on Monday, the lowest single-day increase the state has seen since November. The percentage of people testing positive for the virus dropped to 9.3% over the weekend, and 284 fewer patients were hospitalized with coronavirus since Friday\u2019s update, according to the Virginia Hospital and Healthcare Association. The downward trends are promising after January\u2019s high of nearly 10,000 cases. But there\u2019s widening concern among public health officials that another peak could be likely if residents relax their behaviors while the number of highly transmissible variants in the U.S. continues to grow. Epidemiologists at University of Virginia\u2019s Biocomplexity Institute \u2014 which has tracked COVID trends for nearly a year \u2014 outlined three potential scenarios for the upcoming months taking the variants into account. One where people ignored restrictions and vaccinations didn\u2019t accelerate alongside the new variants projected a 40% increase in transmission by May, launching Virginia back to numbers as high, if not higher, than January \u2014 which was also the deadliest month of the pandemic. \u201cTo avoid high peaks, we must give vaccines time to have an impact, especially as new variants become more prevalent across the nation,\u201d said the report. \u201cDo your part to stop the spread. Continue to practice good prevention and get vaccinated when eligible.\u201d On Friday, UVa confirmed cases of a strain that originated in the United Kingdom. The Virginia Department of Health found the first case in Eastern Virginia the same day. A total of at least 11 Virginia cases have been identified in the past month. Across 40 states in the U.S., there are 1,173 cases of the U.K. variant, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the country\u2019s top infectious disease expert, has said in White House COVID-19 briefings that it will likely become the dominant strain within a month. In a newsletter to UVa students on Friday, Provost Liz Magill, Chief Operating Officer J.J. Davis and Chairman of the Department of Medicine Dr. Mitch Rosner said the university was experiencing \u201ca troubling rise in positive cases in our student community\u201d as more cases of the variant are confirmed. \u201cIf cases continue to increase, our isolation and quarantine capacity will become strained and we will be forced to consider stricter measures, including a shift to Short-Term Restricted Operations,\u201d read the letter. The restrictions would include moving all undergraduate classes online and limiting the ability for students to travel on or off Grounds. While 33 of 35 health districts are seeing downward trends \u2014 and Monday\u2019s case increase is half the number reported on Friday \u2014 the cases and hospitalizations are mimicking what the state saw two months ago. Virginia is currently averaging almost 3,000 daily cases and more than 2,000 people hospitalized per day, which was last seen the first week of December. This is also 2.5 times the average seen at the peak of the August surge: 1,198 cases. Before November, the highest average of hospitalizations over a seven-day period was on May 12, with 1,573. Vaccine update More than one million people in the state have been vaccinated with at least one dose, according to Virginia Department of Health data updated Monday. This is slightly more than 12% of the state\u2019s population. Nearly 1.4 million shots have been given and of that number, 337,968 people are fully vaccinated. Virginia has received upward of 1.7 million vaccine doses. Of the shipments allotted for first doses, roughly 93% have been administered; for second doses, about half of the supply has been used. The state has consistently surpassed the national average for weeks in a sharp improvement from its first month of the rollout. As of Monday, Virginia is among the top 10 in the country for percentage of vaccines given.","326":"Researchers who tested nearly 4,700 Virginians from June to mid-August for traces of a prior coronavirus infection found that only about 2.4% had previously been sick. But two out of three of those who had contracted the virus didn\u2019t have any symptoms. And when adjusted for population, the numbers were nearly three times higher than summer reports of positive tests on the Virginia Department of Health website. This indicates that the number of COVID cases, as expected, is likely much higher said Dr. Eric Houpt, infectious disease expert at University of Virginia Health who co-authored the report. When someone is completely asymptomatic, he said, \u201cyou\u2019re very unlikely to test them and to detect them, because why would they get tested in the first place, unless they were being tested through some screening mechanism?\u201d Findings showed that less than 20% had taken a COVID-19 test and only 1% of total adults in the study ever received a previous positive test result. The Centers of Disease Control and Prevention released a study the first week of January with similar results. It found 60% of transmission may be coming from asymptomatic individuals. \u201cWe\u2019ve always known that we\u2019re missing a lot of infections because we don\u2019t have daily testing on every single person in the state or in the community or anywhere,\u201d Houpt said. \u201cThat three-fold number is not surprising. Some studies have found that it\u2019s up to 10 [times] more.\u201d Virginia\u2019s total caseload of positive test reports is at 553,308 as of Tuesday. If multiplied by 2.8, which researchers found was the difference when adjusted for population, the state would have more than 1.5 million cases. With highly transmissible variants likely to become the dominant virus strain in March, months after the state\u2019s deadliest month in January, Houpt urged residents to be careful and continue wearing masks and social distancing. A Friday report from scientists in the United Kingdom, where one variant first originated, found an increased risk of hospitalization and death. Research is ongoing. \u201cThe virus is still here,\u201d Houpt said. \u201cIt\u2019s foolish to predict too far ahead with this thing. It\u2019s been unpredictable from the beginning. It\u2019s far too early to conclude that we\u2019re on the tail end of this. We have a long way to go.\u201d The COVID-19 serology project\u2014conducted in tandem with the VDH and four other major health systems across the state including VCU\u2014released its initial results in September. Participants were patients who sought out medical care for non-virus-related reasons. Published in the journal JAMA Network Open last Monday, the finalized research expanded upon its earlier estimates. In September, the study noted that Latinos were four times more likely to have traces of a prior infection than the average Virginian. While that didn\u2019t change, the latest release noted the likelihood that Latinos make up nearly 42% of the state\u2019s cases. At the time of the study, they accounted for less than 34%. The findings also showed a potential 20% difference between ZIP codes, even ones next to each other. Houpt said geographically, researchers noted that people in Northern Virginia had higher rates of antibodies\u2014as did residents without health insurance, limited access to care and those living in more crowded housing. A limitation to the study is that antibody studies are less reliable than diagnostic COVID-19 tests, which measure the active presence of the virus, while antibody tests which point to signs that the body has fought off a past infection. But the results track from where current cases are. In Richmond, ZIP codes in South Richmond and the city\u2019s East End\u2014which hold the largest non-white populations in lower-income areas\u2014were 60% of COVID cases from Dec. 14 to Feb. 3. They were also the farthest from established vaccination sites. Less than five miles away, a more affluent ZIP code that is 87% white had the second-lowest number of cases. Vaccine update Virginia has administered nearly 1.4 million shots. Almost 95% of vaccines allotted for first doses have been given. For second doses, it\u2019s more than half. At least 351,441 people have been fully vaccinated and 12.3% of the state\u2019s total population has received at least one dose. The state is averaging almost 35,000 shots given each day over a seven-day period. The state has consistently surpassed the national average for weeks in a sharp improvement from its first month of the rollout. As of Tuesday, Virginia was 7th in the country for percentage of supply used.","327":"University of Virginia officials on Tuesday banned all in-person events and gatherings on and off Grounds and shuttered recreational centers, citing a sudden surge in student COVID-19 cases related to failure to follow health guidelines. Administrators noted the arrival of the more contagious U.K. variant of the virus on Grounds in announcing the restrictions, which took effect Tuesday at 7 p.m. They will be in effect until Feb. 26. The move came as 121 new cases were reported Monday, 117 of which were among students. That\u2019s the highest daily new case count since Feb. 8, when 56 cases were reported among the student body of a total of 58 in the UVa community. Nearly 25% of the school\u2019s quarantine capacity was full, despite beds being added on Monday. Nearly 20% of the school\u2019s isolation beds were full as of Tuesday, officials said. On Friday, UVa officials announced that the more contagious U.K. variant had been identified on Grounds, which increased concern that cases could spike. \u201cSince we communicated those concerns on Friday, we have seen an additional, and unusually large, increase in positive cases, spread widely both on and off Grounds,\u201d a letter to the UVa community sent by the school\u2019s top administrators said. \u201cOur in-house analysis indicates that this spread is not directly related to variants but instead to transmission of the original strain of the virus, which can occur when individuals are not closely following health and safety protocols,\u201d the email reads. The letter is signed by UVa President Jim Ryan, Provost Liz Magill, Chief Operating Officer J.J. Davis and Dr. K. Craig Kent, executive vice president for health affairs. The restrictions and the surge came as multiple social media posts reported parties among university students as part of fraternity rush, which began Feb. 1 and ended with bid day on Feb. 14. Posts on most social media, including Twitter and Reddit, included numerous posts complaining of large gatherings that the posters believed were rush-related. The university\u2019s Inter-Fraternity Council, or IFC, allowed some in-person events during rush, but required that the events meet social distancing guidelines and community and UVa regulations. \u201cWe believe it is unfair to place stricter restrictions on our chapters than those of the university, city, and state, and it is detrimental to [potential new members], especially those from diverse backgrounds, to have no opportunities for in-person interactions with active fraternity members,\u201d the IFC\u2019s finalized rush plans, emailed to members prior to rush, state. \u201cWe fully understand the concern of many individuals that this may lead to certain chapters breaking mandated COVID rules, but we believe it is absolutely crucial that [potential new members] participating in IFC rush have the ability to have some in-person contact with active fraternity members to ensure they make the right decision for who they will be spending a significant portion of their time at UVa with,\u201d the plans state. Although the in-person events were supposed to meet guidelines, including UVa\u2019s limit of six socially distanced and properly masked people, there were reports that regional venues received requests from UVa organizations to rent space for 60 to 100 people. One request was for up to 60 people on Feb. 1 and another for up to 100 for March 6. There was no indication if the Feb. 1 event took place. Those requests were placed on a venue-sourcing website that sends requests to numerous event centers. The new restrictions will focus on the entire student body. \u201cWe know that the temporary steps outlined will be difficult for members of this community, particularly our students. That said, in light of the rapid growth in cases we have seen over the past week, we believe they are essential to preserving our isolation and quarantine space and reducing the risk of spreading cases into the Charlottesville\/Albemarle community,\u201d officials wrote. The restrictions include prohibiting all in-person events on and off Grounds and all social gatherings, club and organization functions and other in-person interactions. Libraries will be contactless access only In-person classes, dining facilities and research activities will continue, with additional social distancing measures. Employees are encouraged to work remotely, if possible. Staff and students who work in areas temporarily closed by the restrictions will still be paid. \u201cThis temporary plan is designed to limit opportunities for the virus to spread between people,\u201d administrators wrote. \u201cWe do not take these actions lightly, but they are necessary at a time when the virus is more widespread, and it appears members of our community are not adhering to our health and safety protocols as consistently as they did last semester.\u201d Administrators said they will consider easing the restrictions if conditions improve. \u201cIn the event we continue to see a rise in cases, we will be forced to consider additional measures, including moving all undergraduate classes online and considering the same for graduate and professional schools,\u201d they wrote.","328":"Christopher Newport University has suspended three student organizations and dismissed 15 students from campus. Liberty University\u2019s president apologized after hundreds of students, many unmasked, participated in an on-campus snowball fight and posed together for photos. Virginia Military Institute acknowledged a failure to keep students separated from cadets who were supposed to be in quarantine as they marched alongside the rest of the student body earlier this month. Though COVID-19 cases are on the decline in Virginia, universities are still reporting hundreds of infections this semester. Since the start of 2021, there have been more than 4,000 cases at Virginia colleges among students and staff, according to a Richmond Times-Dispatch analysis of university dashboards. At its current pace, the total number of infections at Virginia four-year colleges this semester would eclipse last semester\u2019s total of 10,200. Eight colleges have already recorded more cases in 2021 than all of 2020. During their second semester battling the virus, universities have increased testing, accounting for some potion of the higher positive results. But they also face complacency among students, new variants of the virus and greater community spread across the state. At the University of Virginia, 350 cases were reported in the past two days, pushing the school\u2019s total to 974 since the start of the year. The U.K. variant of the virus, B.1.1.7, was detected on UVA\u2019s campus last week. As of Tuesday, the university\u2019s positivity rate was 2.6%. UVA administrators announced that in-person classes would continue for now, but social gatherings and extracurricular activities would be forced online. They asked students to stay home whenever possible. At Virginia Tech, more than 500 students and staff have tested positive. Nearly 8% of tests came back positive this week, which is lower than this point in the fall semester. But at this point in the fall, the positivity rate was on the downturn. This time, it\u2019s going up. Virginia Tech president Timothy Sands told students Wednesday they should assume the U.K. variant is present in their community, too. Experts consider the variant more infectious and capable of causing greater illness. \u201cWe are seeing evidence among our student population that the prevalence of moderate symptoms is increasing,\u201d Sands said. While UVA and Virginia Tech have reported the most cases in 2021, comparing one college to another is problematic. Schools don\u2019t use the same methodology for counting cases, and they don\u2019t test their students at the same rate. With its own lab on campus, UVA has run 50,000 tests this year. Virginia Tech has conducted 17,000, and VCU has completed less than 7,000. Those numbers pale in comparison to the country\u2019s most efficient college lab. The University of Illinois has consistently tested 10,000 students a day since August. UVA increased its testing capacity from 150 per day last year to 4,000 now. VCU made surveillance testing mandatory. George Mason University says it expects to test 10,000 students a week by March. Virginia Tech will double its testing, Sands said Wednesday. VCU has reported 381 cases among students and staff since the beginning of 2021. Liberty University has reported 290, and VMI, 281. VMI, Longwood University and CNU are among the schools that have already seen more cases in 2021 than all of 2020. At VMI, cadets in quarantine were allowed to participate in breakout, the annual passage from the rat line. Those in quarantine marched alongside other students. Two hundred sixty-five cadets have tested positive in January and February, 16% of the student population. When the University of Richmond began its spring semester, 17% of its non-resident students tested positive, and they were asked to stay off campus for two weeks. UR has reported 287 cases so far in 2021, double its total from all of 2020. Fighting complacency is a challenge in 2021, Dr. Mitch Rosner, chair of the UVA department of medicine, said. Though more than 1,000 UVA students tested positive in the fall, not one required hospitalization. The vaccine is coming, and many students have already tested positive, giving them the sense they are immune. \u201cThe presumption that \u2018I can\u2019t be reinfected if I\u2019ve already had COVID-19\u2019 or \u2018I\u2019m young and healthy so my symptoms will be mild\u2019 were never universally true, and if anything, they are even more in doubt now,\u201d Sands said. To combat COVID fatigue, UVA engaged with 400 student leaders and asked them to take responsibility and amplify the school\u2019s message of following the rules. Another reason why universities are reporting such high cases is because the virus continues to spread at a high rate in Virginia. On Tuesday, there were 35 cases per 100,000 people in Virginia. That\u2019s down from a high of 72 a month ago, but still above any point in the pandemic prior to December. \u201cWhen we get to the levels of spread we see now in Virginia, we would expect a great deal of additional transmission in the absence of additional adherence to mitigation strategies \u2013 avoiding indoor gatherings, wearing face coverings and keeping distance,\u201d said Lisa M. Lee, a professor of public health at Virginia Tech. It will be several months until enough vaccines have been distributed for people to let their guard down, Lee said. Young, healthy college students will have to wait until after much of the population has received a shot. Until then, continued spread of the virus leads to viral mutations and the possibility that those mutations will evade vaccines. Though the number of positive cases reported by college campuses continues to increase, those numbers may only represent a fraction of people actually infected. A study conducted by UVA found that while 550,000 Virginians have tested positive for the coronavirus, likely three times as many have been infected. UVA\u2019s study notes that its findings were lower than other projections of true infection rate.","329":"More than a dozen University of Virginia students asked the school\u2019s Board of Visitors to forego a possible 3.1% tuition increase for the next school year, citing financial impacts the hike would have on themselves, their families and their friends. The board held the meeting Wednesday as part of its budget-setting process. The board will consider raising tuition between zero and 3.1% for next school year. The top end figure is based on the cost of providing a college education across the country, plus 1%. The board is proposing a $114 increase in fees, including $75 to pay for expanding student health and wellness services and a new wellness facility. The remaining fee increase will pay for improvements to recreational facilities and Newcomb Hall. Based on tuition, fees and other expenses listed by UVa for the 2020-2021 school year, an in-state undergraduate in the arts and sciences school would see a tuition and fee increase of about $554 a year. That would bring total tuition and fees to about $17,860. Including room and board, food, books and personal expenses as estimated by the university for the 2020-20221 school year, an increase would push costs for students and families to about $34,600 a year. A 3.1% hike in out of state tuition would be an estimated increase of $1,489, bringing tuition and fees charged nonresidents to about $53,417. With current existing cost of books and room and board, nonresident students would pay about $70,200 a year. Different schools within the university charge different tuition rates and graduate schools often charge more. Rector James B. Murray said the board is looking to balance its next year\u2019s budget after a tough current fiscal year. The year has seen the pandemic limit incomes; increase the cost of providing classes and safe facilities and cut athletics and other activities that earned the school money. \u201c2020 has been a tough year for everybody, for the students, parents and the administration. It\u2019s been a financially troubling year and psychologically troubling year,\u201d Murray said. \u201cWe have lost a lot of revenue. We don\u2019t have housing revenue, dining revenue, athletics, or student and public services. There are many areas of the university that usually support our working enterprise that are not available to the university now, under these conditions.\u201d Murray said the school has had to cut back on personnel costs. \u201cWe have been able to avoid extensive layoffs, but we have a hiring freeze,\u201d he said. \u201cFaculty and staff have not had raises and many have taken pay cuts but they have been able to keep us on a solid financial footing where other [schools] have been in trouble.\u201d The exact tuition increase won\u2019t be known until the state legislature sets its budget, including its contributions to UVa, Murray said. The school is planning to have its budget ready for Board of Visitors\u2019 approval by the board\u2019s March 5 meeting. \u201cThe board is committed to keeping tuition increases at a minimum and using every other source of revenue whenever and where ever we can,\u201d Murray said. \u201cTuition is always the last lever that we pull. But we are here at the point where we have to set a final budget of the coming year. Parents of incoming students need to know what tuition they have to pay, so we have to consider that last lever.\u201d The two dozen students who addressed the UVa board in the virtual meeting, many of whom were associated with the Student Council\u2019s legislative committee, sought to shelve of the tuition hike. Many pointed to a student survey that showed between 58% and 64% of students, depending on their ethnicity, believe an increase would be detrimental to their studies. They also noted that last spring several schools, including William and Mary, Virginia Commonwealth University and Virginia Tech voted to hold 2020-2021 tuition at the 2019-2020 fiscal year rate, citing the pandemic\u2019s impacts on the economy. Virginia State University has indicated it will not raise tuition for 2021-2022. \u201cI\u2019m here today to beg you to keep tuition at its current level, or even reduce it,\u201d said Levi Schult, a fourth year student studying astrophysics. \u201cMost of my friends, including me, have lost their jobs due to the pandemic. I, personally, was only able to find a new job because I have a car and I was able to find a delivery job that still puts me at risk for contracting COVID-19.\u201d Schult said many of his friends have taken jobs that put them at risk of the virus despite having no health insurance. \u201cThe Board of Visitors and the UVa administration may not see the pain inflicted by this tuition raise, but it does not mean it won\u2019t be felt among those already most marginalized and in need,\u201d he said Third-year math and economics student Madison Perry said she took on two jobs because her job in the restaurant industry \u201ctook a hit like so, so many others.\u201d Perry said a parent\u2019s illness has made her education a burden on her family and she has had to take out private loans to pay. \u201cSomething really stuck out to me in Mr. Murray\u2019s opening address to the board; tuition is the last lever that the board wants to pull,\u201d she said. \u201cObviously, I\u2019m assuming good faith here, but why do you pull it every year? Why has tuition gone up every year for decades now?\u201d Grace O. Gyamfi, a fourth year student, said she has been on financial aid for a while and felt blessed for the opportunity. \u201cI just have to say that, after I graduate, a tuition freeze isn\u2019t really going to have anything to do with me,\u201d she said. \u201cBut there are many students at UVa who have been struggling since their first year to pay for tuition. Money has always been an issue. Money has always been difficult.\u201d Gyamfi said that the problems paying tuition impact the quality of education a student receives. \u201cPeople are woefully limited to the choices that they have to make. Some people have to make choices on whether or not they can go to school or whether or not they can take care of their family. They have to choose whether to go to the dentist or pay tuition,\u201d she said. According to information presented at the virtual meeting, the cut in state funding over the years has not been made up by tuition increases. The university estimates that it costs $3,648 per student more to run the school than tuition and state funds cover. That money is covered through a variety of other funding sources, including donors and investment earnings. Administrators said about 42 cents of every dollar raised in tuition or received from state funds pays for faculty salaries. They estimated that 35 cents of each dollar goes for academic support services, including libraries, student advising and technology. About 8 cents of the tuition buck go to support graduate teaching assistants; a nickel goes to facilities and utilities; another nickel goes to administration; 4 cents goes to student support including the Dean of Students office; and 1 cent goes to public outreach.","330":"As concerns about the coronavirus continue to grow through the United States, Saturday\u2019s Virginia-Louisville men\u2019s basketball game at John Paul Jones Arena will be played as scheduled, the school announced in a statement on Friday evening. \u201cThe University of Virginia is closely monitoring the impact of COVID-19 [coronavirus] and our top priority is the health and safety of our students, staff and fans,\u201d the statement read. \u201cThe Virginia-Louisville men\u2019s basketball game will be played as scheduled on Saturday at 4 p.m. at John Paul Jones Arena.\u201d The school also said in the statement that \u201cextra precautionary sanitary measures have been put in place at JPJ\u201d for Saturday\u2019s regular-season finale between the Cavaliers and Cardinals and urged fans who are not feeling well to stay at home. \u201cIf you\u2019re feeling ill, we encourage you to stay home and use your best judgement,\u201d the statement read. To date, no UVa sporting events have been altered or postponed because of coronavirus concerns. Virginia governor Ralph Northam said Wednesday that there have been no positive tests for coronavirus in the commonwealth. \u201cWe\u2019ve been preparing for #COVID19 since January, and we\u2019re executing our public health plans,\u201d Northam wrote in a tweet on Wednesday. \u201cAt this time, the risk of coronavirus in our commonwealth is low, but it\u2019s important that all Virginians do their part to keep themselves and our communities safe.\u201d","331":"A day after throttling UMass Lowell 24-5, the Virginia baseball team found itself in a fight with the River Hawks on Wednesday. UMass Lowell scored the first run of the day and hung tough all afternoon on an unusual day at the ballpark. In the end, Virginia prevailed 4-3 to finish off its 15-game homestand in winning style. The game began at 11 a.m. for Field Trip Day. A few hundred kids from local schools poured into Disharoon Park to check out the Cavaliers, and they created one of the most energetic atmospheres of the season. \u201cU-V-A\u201d chants began with about 40 minutes until the first pitch. With a more crowded stadium than usual for a midweek game, the atmosphere was lively all day. Until, of course, the kids had to pack up for the day and head back to school around the sixth inning. With the game on the line in the final innings, the crowd was quieter than it had been in the second inning. Most of the noise the rest of the way came from the dugouts. \u201cIt was one of the stranger days that I\u2019ve had in this stadium, really, because typically a baseball crowd is not like that,\u201d Virginia head coach Brian O\u2019Connor said. \u201cIt just seemed like a nonstop buzzing in my ear, although it\u2019s great. I\u2019m glad all the kids came out, and I\u2019d love it if the next time we get a chance to do it there [are] 4,000 kids here from our community. I think it\u2019s a neat opportunity for them to come out and enjoy a baseball game.\u201d As the game went on, there was also an announcement from UVa that classes would be moving online for the \u201cforeseeable future\u201d and \u201cquite possibly through the end of the semester\u201d in response to the spread of COVID-19. The UVa players found out the news after the game in their team discussion. Wednesday\u2019s game was anything but typical. On the field, the River Hawks (4-11) led 1-0 early before Virginia (14-4) answered with two runs of its own in the bottom half of the first inning to take a 2-1 lead. The first run came in on a balk, and the second came on an Alex Tappen sacrifice fly. UMass Lowell answered with a solo home run to left field from freshman catcher Ryan Proto. Both pitching staffs performed well over the middle innings, keeping the game knotted at 2 through the sixth inning. UVa used Jake Hodorovich, Blake Bales, Paul Zosanovich and Zach Messinger to work through the first six frames. Hodorovich, a freshman, received the start and gave up two runs in two innings of work. UVa took a 3-2 lead in the bottom of the seventh on an RBI single through the left side from freshman Max Cotier, but UMass Lowell bounced back with a run in the eighth to tie the game. It could have been worse, but the Cavaliers\u2019 Stephen Schoch, who came in relief of Andrew Abbott after he allowed the run earlier in the inning, induced a line-drive double play to third baseman Zack Gelof with runners on second and third. Gelof dove head first toward third base after catching the liner. He beat the runner to the bag with his glove, recording the second out. \u201cCoach told me to get a ground ball double play,\u201d Schoch said. \u201cI mean, I didn\u2019t really do that but I kind of did.\u201d The inning ended on a fly out as the line-drive double play helped UVa escape the jam. In the bottom half of the frame, Logan Michaels drove in freshman centerfielder Chris Newell on an RBI single up the middle. Virginia led 4-3 after the base knock. Newell went 3-for-4 on the day to raise his batting average to .407. Newell enjoyed the raucous atmosphere and the budding star performed well for the kids in attendance. \u201cIt was pretty cool, honestly, to have all those kids there,\u201d Newell said. \u201cMade it fun for us, having all those kids cheering us on. It\u2019s pretty cool knowing that they look up to us.\u201d With the kids long gone, Schoch returned to the mound and loaded the bases with two outs in the top of the ninth. The final out came on a high chopper to shortstop. Nic Kent charged, snagged the ball as it came down and flipped it directly out of his glove and into the glove of Max Cotier, who reached down to secure the force out at second base. Much like the game, the final play could have gone either way, but Virginia ultimately did enough to secure the win.","332":"March Madness, one of the most popular college sporting events in the world, will be played in front of only essential staff members and select family members this season. \u201cBased on their advice and my discussions with the NCAA Board of Governors, I have made the decision to conduct our upcoming championship events, including the Division I men\u2019s and women\u2019s basketball tournaments, with only essential staff and limited family attendance,\u201d NCAA President Mark Emmert said in a statement. The announcement comes after the ACC originally announced on Tuesday that it would proceed with its conference tournament normally. After releasing a statement Wednesday evening saying that the Wednesday night games would proceed as normal, the league released an additional statement Wednesday night saying that ACC Tournament games scheduled for Thursday, Friday and Saturday would have limited attendees. \u201cAfter consultation with the league\u2019s presidents and athletic directors, it was determined that beginning Thursday, March 12, all games will be played with only essential tournament personnel, limited school administrators and student-athlete guests, broadcast television and credentialed media members present,\u201d the statement said. Virginia opens ACC Tournament play Thursday night at 7 p.m. The NCAA\u2019s decision comes hours after conferences took drastic measures to help mitigate the spread of COVID-19. In addition to the ACC\u2019s decision, the Ivy League announced Wednesday that it was cancelling all spring sports competitions and practices. The Virginia baseball team had two games scheduled with Cornell at the end of the month, and the Ivy League is one of the nation\u2019s best leagues in men\u2019s lacrosse. Top-tier teams such as Cornell, Princeton and Yale will no longer play this season. The Virginia men\u2019s basketball team, which won the national championship a season ago and is NCAA Tournament bound this season, will try to defend its title in front of largely empty arenas. \u201cWhile I understand how disappointing this is for all fans of our sports, my decision is based on the current understanding of how COVID-19 is progressing in the United States,\u201d Emmert said in his statement. \u201cThis decision is in the best interest of public health, including that of coaches, administrators, fans and most importantly, our student-athletes.\u201d Emmert did add that he expects the championships to still occur, but that the NCAA is going to monitor information and make adjustments as needed. The First Four of the NCAA men\u2019s basketball tournament begins Tuesday, and Round 1 begins two days later on March 19. The event lasts through April 6. The decision by the NCAA also comes after some universities across the U.S. adjusted their class schedules. UVa, which is currently on spring break, cancelled in-person classes \u201cfor the foreseeable future, quite possibly through the end of the semester.\u201d Online classes begin March 19 for UVa students. UVa also wrote in its announcement that there were no changes to athletic events at this time, but that restrictions would be considered. According to a spokesperson, Virginia football coach Bronco Mendenhall has \u201cinformed the team there will be no football activities until further notice.\u201d Spring practice was scheduled to open on March 24.","333":"We built a timeline to make it easier to follow how we went from Virginia men\u2019s basketball getting set to compete in the ACC Tournament to the Cavaliers\u2019 season ending without Tony Bennett\u2019s team even taking the court. Wednesday, March 11 11:02 a.m. \u2013 UVa\u2019s baseball game against UMass Lowell began. The Cavaliers played in front of children for Field Trip Day. The listed attendance was 3,208. 12:50 p.m. \u2013 UVa announced that it wouldn\u2019t hold classes on grounds for the \u201cforeseeable future.\u201d It also prohibited university events with more than 100 people, excluding sporting events and events at John Paul Jones Arena. 2:19 p.m. \u2013 UVa\u2019s baseball game with UMass Lowell concluded, marking what now seems to be the final Virginia baseball game for the entire spring season. 3 p.m. \u2013 The Ivy League canceled all spring sports competition and practices. 3 p.m. \u2013 The UVa men\u2019s tennis team started its match against William & Mary, winning 7-0 in what appears to be the last UVa sporting event of the spring season. 4:15 p.m. \u2013 The NCAA advised against holding NCAA Tournament basketball games with fans. 4:30 p.m. \u2013 The NCAA announced that the NCAA Tournament would be played without fans. Only limited guests and essential staff were included on the list of people allowed to attend outside the teams. 7:50 p.m. \u2013 Mike Barber of the Richmond Times-Dispatch reported that the UVa football team would halt team activities until further notice. The Cavaliers were scheduled to begin spring practices on March 24. 7:58 p.m. \u2013 The ACC announced that after its Wednesday games, the rest of the men\u2019s basketball conference tournament would be held without fans, except for the ticket allotment of 150 given to each team. 9:27 p.m. \u2013 Rudy Gobert of the Utah Jazz tested positive for coronavirus. 9:31 p.m. \u2013 The NBA announced the suspension of its season. 10:31 p.m. \u2013 The National Association of Basketball Coaches canceled its convention in Atlanta that occurs in conjunction with the Final Four. 10:40 p.m. \u2013 Nebraska head basketball coach Fred Hoiberg was taken to the hospital after becoming ill on the sideline at a Big Ten Tournament game. Thursday, March 12 12:34 a.m. \u2013 The G-League suspended play. Kyle Guy scored 25 points and fellow former Wahoo Devon Hall scored 24 in a game against each other just hours earlier. 12:43 a.m. \u2013 Nebraska released a statement that Fred Hoiberg was diagnosed with influenza A, not COVID-19. 9:30 a.m. \u2013 ACC Commissioner John Swofford joined the ACC Network\u2019s \u201cPacker and Durham\u201d to discuss the plans for the ACC men\u2019s basketball tournament. Swofford said there would still be games. 10:32 a.m. \u2013 The Patriot League canceled all spring sports practices and competitions. 10:49 a.m. \u2013 ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski reported that Utah Jazz guard Donovan Mitchell tested positive for the coronavirus. 11:42 a.m. \u2013 Major League Soccer suspended its season for 30 days. 11:45 a.m. \u2013 The American Athletic Conference, Big Ten and SEC all canceled their men\u2019s basketball conference tournaments. 12:15 p.m. \u2013 The ACC canceled its men\u2019s basketball conference tournaments. 1:36 p.m. \u2013 The NHL paused its games for the 2019-20 season. 3:10 p.m. \u2013 MLB announced the delay of opening day by at least two weeks, and the league suspended spring training games. 3:10 p.m. \u2013 The ACC suspended all athletic related activity, including competition, practice and recruiting. 3:21 p.m. \u2013 Following the ACC\u2019s lead, UVa announced the suspension of all athletic related activity. 4:16 p.m. \u2013 Major news dropped, as the NCAA announced it was canceling the Division I men\u2019s and women\u2019s 2020 basketball tournaments and the remaining winter and spring NCAA championships. The 2019-20 UVa sports season effectively ended.","334":"The spread of COVID-19 ended numerous collegiate sports seasons. Due to the unprecedented circumstances, the NCAA\u2019s Division I Council made an unprecedented decision to grant all spring sports athletes an extra year of eligibility. Winter sports athletes will not receive an extra year of eligibility. The decision was announced Monday evening. This means UVa seniors such as baseball\u2019s Logan Michaels and Stephen Schoch can continue their careers. On the other hand, the collegiate careers of men\u2019s basketball\u2019s Mamadi Diakite and Braxton Key are finished. While the decision most notably benefits spring sports seniors, all spring sports athletes can take an extra year of eligibility, regardless of class. Not all athletes will accept the additional eligibility, however. Baseball pitcher Chesdin Harrington said he was undecided about a potential decision a few weeks ago, and softball\u2019s Riley Wilkinson told The Daily Progress her career is over since she\u2019s headed to medical school next season. Players will have decisions to make over the coming months. The council adjusted scholarship rules to account for players taking advantage of eligibility relief, allowing teams to roster both incoming recruits and returning seniors receiving an additional year of eligibility. The NCAA also made it possible for schools to provide less or no financial aid to returning student-athletes who were in their final years of eligibility. If the UVa baseball team finds itself struggling to cover the scholarship costs of all its athletes, it could bring a senior back by offering less or no financial aid to handle the costs of rostering more athletes than originally expected. Those individual decisions are made at the discretion of each Division I school. \u201cSchools also will have the ability to use the NCAA\u2019s Student Assistance Fund to pay for scholarships for students who take advantage of the additional eligibility flexibility in 2020-21,\u201d the NCAA\u2019s statement said. As part of its decision, the NCAA increased the roster limit in baseball to accommodate for additional returning players. According to Kendall Rogers, a co-managing editor at D1Baseball.com, any seniors who return won\u2019t count against a team\u2019s roster limit. By allowing spring sport athletes an extra year of eligibility, the NCAA hopes it gives back to players who lost a season due to a global pandemic. \u201cThe council\u2019s decision gives individual schools flexibility to make decisions at a campus level,\u201d said council chair M. Grace Calhoun, athletics Director at Penn. \u201cThe Board of Governors encouraged conferences and schools to take action in best interest of student-athletes and their communities, and now schools have the opportunity to do that.\u201d","335":"The spread of COVID-19 has forced the cancellation of athletic activity across collegiate athletics. The immediate cancellation cut short the seasons of spring sports athletes, ending their years before they hit their stride. The moves also hit fall sports hard, including collegiate football programs that rely on spring practices to develop players for the fall. Virginia\u2019s football program, which relies on developing under-the-radar recruits into All-ACC caliber performers, will certainly miss the spring practices. Instead of working out in Charlottesville, the players are home trying to find ways to stay in shape for when they\u2019re able to return to school. Losing out on spring ball hurts the Cavaliers for a few reasons. QB development slowed Bryce Perkins has exhausted his eligibility and is preparing to play in the NFL. This leaves UVa without a starting quarterback. Redshirt sophomore Brennan Armstrong enters the season as the projected starting quarterback. He\u2019s thrown just 25 passes in a Virginia uniform. A spring season with first-team reps would have done Armstrong a world of good. \u201cNo question that will hurt us,\u201d UVa head coach Bronco Mendenhall said. \u201cNo question it will set us back. No question it will make it harder to execute the way we need to and it puts more pressure and a tighter time frame on all of us.\u201d Mendenhall mentioned the need for Armstrong to be creative with his at-home training. Fortunately for the Wahoos, Armstrong works out in Ohio in the garage gym of his brother\u2019s friend. He\u2019s able to stay out of large groups while still having access to a bench and squat rack. Armstrong also throws to former high school teammates to work on passing. As stay-at-home rules become increasingly strict across the country, it\u2019s unknown how long Armstrong will be able to follow this regimen, but since UVa canceled athletic activity, Armstrong has found creative ways to stay in shape in Ohio. The lack of spring practice leaves Armstrong wondering how the offense will evolve to fit his strengths rather than the strengths of Perkins. Armstrong is a shifty runner and accurate passer, while Perkins could turn a scramble into a 50-yard touchdown run at any moment. Offensive coordinator Robert Anae is given the task of altering the offense in any way he deems fit to help the team play its best with Armstrong calling the shots. \u201cThat\u2019s something to be found out,\u201d Armstrong said of the offense under his watch. \u201cWe would have found that out a little bit more in spring ball. We still have our offense. I\u2019m not sure if they\u2019re going to tweak anything more toward my style. I\u2019m actually really excited to see how it works.\u201d Leaders TBD While spring gives teams a chance to evaluate players, especially quarterbacks, it also begins the process of assigning leadership roles. With Bryce Hall, Eli Hanback, Jordan Mack, Bryce Perkins and Joe Reed gone, the Cavaliers are left to find new leaders on both sides of the ball. The defense could lean on seniors like linebacker Charles Snowden, while wide receiver Terrell Jana seems like a budding leader on the offensive side of the football. Without the spring, leaders develop through text messages and video conference calls rather than in-person interactions and practices. \u201cThat\u2019s when you kind of see a lot of the older guys as well kind of step up into those leadership roles and the team really kind of comes together, cause in the winter time, when we work out it\u2019s kind of separated between the skill position groups and the big guys,\u201d Snowden said. \u201cSo the spring time\u2019s where we all kind of come together and you see who will really step out and be the leaders for the next season.\u201d This puts some pressure on a player like Armstrong, who didn\u2019t start last season but is expected to fill a leadership role as the starting quarterback for the Cavaliers this season. Even with the unusual circumstances, Armstrong says the leadership will come with time. \u201cI think it\u2019s my job to talk more,\u201d Armstrong said. \u201cIt will happen. I\u2019m just not trying to force things. I don\u2019t like to force things on the other guys or anything like that. It needs to come naturally. If it needs to be said, I\u2019ll say it, but other than that, I\u2019m just gonna keep grinding, just setting a good example.\u201d New stars on hold Developing into a key contributor within a Power 5 program takes time. It also takes repetition, and confidence is often fostered during practices. Without organized team practices, younger players lose the opportunity to gain confidence through on-field reps. UVa\u2019s defense returns a chunk of experienced contributors, which certainly makes up for some of the lost reps. On offense, however, Virginia brings in plenty of fresh faces expected to compete for increased playing time. Running back Mike Hollins and wide receiver Dontayvion Wix are two rising sophomores expected to see the field more in 2020. \u201cThe spring time is a big time where you really see young guys step up,\u201d Snowden said. \u201cStart to really make a name for themselves. Everyone just kind of works.\u201d Those young athletes lose the chance to come into their own during spring practice. Losing Perkins brings with it the challenge of reinventing the offense to remain productive. UVa embarks on that challenge without spring ball. \u201cI\u2019m really excited about Billy [Kemp], I\u2019m excited about [Tavares Kelly], I\u2019m excited about Wix,\u201d Armstrong said. \u201cI think a lot of people saw Wix being the guy coming into the spring, seeing where he would develop into after his first year. Now that we won\u2019t have that we won\u2019t know, but I\u2019m not worried.\u201d The good news Virginia losing a spring season hurts the program. Armstrong doesn\u2019t have the chance to throw to his receivers and develop that chemistry. Fostering leadership becomes a challenge. Young stars won\u2019t have a chance to build confidence through spring practices. Fortunately for UVa and every other program in the country, everyone is facing the same unusual circumstances. Teams across the nation are missing spring practices. Other teams have new quarterbacks to break into their systems, and those signal callers are missing practices just like Armstrong. UVa\u2019s stellar 2019 also pays dividends. The Cavaliers were able to practice an extra week leading up to the ACC Championship Game, and they got bowl practices for the Orange Bowl. Those give UVa an advantage over teams that didn\u2019t play in conference championship games or bowl games. While it\u2019s hard to know how large that advantage truly is, Virginia and its future quarterback benefited from the extra reps. \u201cAnd, wow, without those \u2014 it\u2019s hard now but I would have felt much differently,\u201d Mendenhall said. \u201cWe basically got a modified spring in that context and Brennan got lots of work then and plenty of repetition and if you remember when Bryce was, Bryce Perkins was hurt early in the year and through fall camp, Brennan received a large volume of work then, early in the season. And so, we\u2019re counting on that repetition bank, so to speak, of early in the season and in preparation for our last two games in an extended 14-game season hopefully mitigating some of the lack of growth and progress that happened or won\u2019t happen through spring.\u201d","336":"The team\u2019s emotions were just leveling out. After the emotional high of walking into its new facility at Palmer Park, the Virginia softball team went through the anxiety and nerves of playing in front of a packed house. Then came the four-game home losing streak in which the Cavaliers were outscored 27-3. They failed to score in three of those games. Finally, UVa picked up its first win in Palmer Park and followed a 2-1 win over Bucknell up with another 2-1 victory in the second game of a doubleheader. Unfortunately, another emotional low hit the program when the Cavaliers learned their wins over Bucknell would be the last time they would play during the 2020 season. The spread of COVID-19 led to the cancellation of spring sport activity, which meant after years of waiting for the new facility, the program had to wait a bit longer to fully experience all of Palmer Park for an entire season. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to come to terms with how incomplete it feels,\u201d junior Kate Covington said. The UVa softball family swallowed the news and tried to process it. For Virginia head coach Joanna Hardin, losing the opportunity to finish the season in the park stung, but it was losing quality time with the team during the most exciting part of the year that hurt the most. \u201cIt probably hit me harder when the NCAA put out their release,\u201d Hardin said. \u201cThen you just knew. Kids are starting to make arrangements to go home, and I probably won\u2019t see a lot of them until either summer school if summer school happens or really August. It\u2019s tough when this has been your life every day and you see these kids more than your family. They are your family.\u201d Palmer Park\u2019s setup made quality time easier to come by. Instead of the previous setup, where players and coaches had to travel to the field and then hop in their cars and head to other parts of grounds for treatment and lifting, much of the work could be done in one central location. That allowed significantly more daily interaction between players and coaches. \u201cWe have so much more informal time to just build relationships with them and engage and they could come in,\u201d Hardin said. \u201cWe had players who would just come in and sit down and just chat about life, not even softball and so that is definitely the hardest part.\u201d While the season ends, the Cavaliers had just one senior. Even with eligibility relief, pitcher Riley Wilkinson is headed to Louisville for medical school. Her departure means the Cavaliers return all but one player from this season\u2019s roster. The end of the season came suddenly. The Cavaliers went from the high of opening a beautiful new facility to the low of seeing their season end. It was an emotional few weeks for the program. The news comes as a shock, but Virginia is keeping the cancellation in perspective. Palmer Park isn\u2019t going anywhere, and one day, softball will return. \u201cIt was just abrupt,\u201d Hardin said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if taken away is the way to say it, but it felt abrupt. It was fast, but we know that we have a home and the girls have a home to come back to when we come back, whenever that is, and we\u2019re still really grateful for that.\u201d Hardin spent time in the days after the announcement tying up loose ends at the stadium and using the press box as a quiet office space. The location allowed her to socially distance while working in the facility. For the immediate future, a silent Palmer Park will be the norm. One day in the future, the fans, players and coaches will return. As she came up to the park one day, Hardin heard the ping of the bat coming from a normally silent park. She wasn\u2019t hallucinating. Hardin arrived at the park and saw a construction worker hitting on the field. One of the people who helped build the field noted the absence of people in a facility designed to shed more light on the UVa softball program. \u201cHe\u2019s like, \u2018Yeah, it\u2019s empty,\u2019\u201d Hardin said. \u201c\u2018It\u2019s like a ghost town without you guys.\u2019 That was another reminder to me that, man, this is so much bigger. Our program and the impact is just way bigger than 60 feet and turn left.\u201d","337":"The ACC announced Friday that the Virginia women\u2019s swimming and diving team won three major All-ACC honors. Paige Madden, a junior, won ACC Swimmer of the Year, Kate Douglass won ACC Freshman of the Year and head coach Todd DeSorbo took home ACC Women\u2019s Swimming Coach of the Year. Madden, an Alabama native, becomes the first Wahoo to win the women\u2019s ACC Swimmer of the Year honor since Lauren Purdue in 2011. Madden won individual titles in the 200, 500 and 1,650-yard freestyle at the ACC Championships. She helped pace a Virginia team that ended the season as one of the best programs in the country. UVa\u2019s team was expected to contend for a national title this season before COVID-19 led to the cancellation of winter and spring sports for the rest of this academic year. The Cavaliers ranked second nationally in the final College Swimming and Diving Coaches Association poll. Douglass started her UVa career strong by winning two individual titles at the ACC Championships. Her victories came in 200-yard individual medley and the 100-yard butterfly. She set an ACC record in the 200-yard individual medley and recorded the fourth-fastest time in NCAA history. The freshman becomes the first Cavalier to win ACC Freshman of the Year since Jennifer Marrkand won the honor in 2015. Leading the team was DeSorbo, who earned his first ACC Women\u2019s Swimming Coach of the Year honor. He joined UVa in 2017 and has led the Cavaliers to a pair of ACC titles, including one this season, in that span. He helped the Cavaliers earn an ACC record 1,492.5 points at this year\u2019s ACC Championships.","338":"Uncertain is arguably the best word to describe the sports landscape at the moment. The unpredictable scope of the spread of COVID-19 makes it nearly impossible to determine when sports might return. While college football\u2019s start date could certainly be impacted, it\u2019s expected that teams will eventually take the field. Whether that\u2019s in September, later in the fall or even next year, it\u2019s likely that college football returns at some point. When Virginia retakes the field, there are a few Cavaliers destined for breakout seasons. Here are five potential breakout stars within the UVa football program. Brennan Armstrong, QB Armstrong is an obvious choice, as he\u2019s expected to become Virginia\u2019s starting quarterback. Taking over for Bryce Perkins brings lofty expectations \u2014 Perkins changed the face of UVa football, according to head coach Bronco Mendenhall \u2014 but Armstrong possesses the physical tools and the mental toughness to succeed at quarterback. \u201cI like his mindset,\u201d Mendenhall said. \u201cHe\u2019s a player that thinks he can make every play. He\u2019s very confident. He\u2019s very, very competitive. He has high standards for himself and he\u2019s actually much better when he\u2019s playing the game than he is in the film room or even in walk through. He\u2019s just one of those players who under duress seems to have the game slow down rather than speed up for him.\u201d On the field, Armstrong is a shifty runner with quickness. He won\u2019t offer the same burst Perkins brought to the offense, but Armstrong can move the chains with his legs. As a passer, Armstrong delivers an accurate ball and has good field awareness, according to Perkins. The left-handed redshirt sophomore leads the group of candidates poised to become breakout stars. Mike Hollins, RB The rising sophomore carried the ball 21 times for 112 yards and three touchdowns as a freshman. A Louisiana native, Hollins showed promise while also struggling with ball security last season. Perkins led the team in rushing last season, which means Hollins and Wayne Taulapapa will be relied on heavily to produce on the ground. Hollins, who was a 3-star recruit coming out of high school, brings speed and elusiveness to the backfield. Taulapapa provides a slightly more physical style of running, and he excelled in short-yardage situations a season ago. With a large group of returning offensive linemen and a new starting quarterback, UVa\u2019s running backs should play a more important role in the offense\u2019s success. With Lamont Atkins, P.K. Kier and Seneca Milledge all leaving the program, the workload will likely fall on the shoulders of Hollins and Taulapapa, although the addition of a graduate transfer is on the table. Dontayvion Wicks, WRAnother Louisiana native, Wicks caught three passes for 61 yards and a touchdown in his freshman season. With one season under his belt, many on the team expected a massive spring from the wide receiver. \u201cI think a lot of people saw Wicks being the guy coming into the spring, seeing where he would develop after his first year,\u201d Armstrong said. Wicks brings a blend of speed and size to the field, and he could emerge as a wide receiver to complement No. 1 option Terrell Jana. The Cavaliers lack depth and proven experience at the position, giving Wicks an ideal opportunity to earn meaningful playing time. Aaron Faumui, DL With Eli Hanback graduating, Faumui becomes one of the options to earn more playing time at defensive end. With Jowon Briggs holding down the middle of the line, it\u2019s likely that Faumui and Mandy Alonso are asked to take on even bigger roles at defensive end. Faumui proved ready for added snaps last season as a sophomore. He finished the season with 33 tackles, including eight tackles for loss and four sacks. Three of those sacks came in November, as he finished the year strong. Most of the disruption in the backfield season resulted in UVa\u2019s linebackers cleaning up the play with tackles for loss and sacks. Given Faumui\u2019s ability, he may rack up big numbers when UVa next steps on the field. Nick Jackson, LB With Rob Snyder returning from injury, Jackson might still be one year away from becoming a breakout star, but he\u2019s likely to see the field plenty for the Cavaliers this season. The Georgia native finished with 28 tackles, including one tackle for loss in his freshman campaign. He appeared in all 14 games. Jackson showed good athleticism as a freshman, and he looked the part of an ACC-caliber player. While it might take him another year or two to reach his full potential, he\u2019s someone capable of breaking out this season. Virginia\u2019s linebackers form arguably the strongest position group on the roster, and Jackson is the star in waiting. \u201cI know in the Orange Bowl he played really well, so I was excited to see him take that next step,\u201d senior linebacker Charles Snowden said. \u201cHe had a great offseason.\u201d","339":"Michael Pittman created the Twitter account \u201c@WahooBasketball\u201d back in 2010 to retweet UVa news and interact with fans about the Virginia men\u2019s basketball program. When he made the account, he figured it would be a fun way to discuss the Wahoos. The account has turned into something much more personal. Pittman owns Caf\u00e9 By The Bay in Deltaville, Virginia. With COVID-19 hurting the small business, which relies on the warmer weather to bring in a steady customer flow, Pittman decided to team up with a friend who prints t-shirts to make a few shirts for the shop. He posted on the @WahooBasketball Twitter account sharing his situation and discussing his four employees who rely on that paycheck. While the caf\u00e9 isn\u2019t Pittman\u2019s main source of income, it is vital to his four dedicated employees. In less than a week, Pittman received over 100 t-shirt orders. \u201cIt\u2019s really, really touching,\u201d Pittman said. \u201cIt really is. It choked me up.\u201d Pittman\u2019s four employees were dumbfounded and grateful for the support. As he told them about the influx of orders, they were shocked to see the small business generating so much attention. \u201cI had to explain it to them,\u201d Pittman said. \u201cThey couldn\u2019t wrap their head around it. I\u2019m like, \u2018Yeah, we just got out 75th order,\u2019 and they\u2019re like, \u2018Mike, who is buying them?\u2019\u201d The customers come from all over. Most customers have a connection to UVa and either follow Pittman\u2019s Twitter account or saw his tweet retweeted in their feed. Some, however, are even Virginia Tech fans. Someone tweeted Pittman, saying, \u201cGood looking shirt. Just purchased. Best of luck from a Hokie!\u201d One buyer is Cynthia Coleman, a 1992 alumna from UVa. Coleman\u2019s husband went to Virginia Tech, and her son, Henry Coleman, is a Duke men\u2019s basketball commit. Coleman grew up in a small town in Virginia, and she resonated with the caf\u00e9 in Deltaville. A loyal UVa supporter, Coleman isn\u2019t surprised in the slightest to see people helping out fellow Cavaliers. She mentioned seeing GoFundMe pages throughout the last week, including one to support Aramark workers out of a job, as the UVa community comes together online to support those in need. \u201cIt\u2019s just absolutely incredible, but not surprising,\u201d Coleman said. \u201cThat\u2019s what we do at UVa.\u201d A 2019 alumna, Adeline Sandridge, also bought a t-shirt. The recent graduate grew up a UVa basketball fan, and her fandom only increased during her time on grounds. Add in experiences going to the Deltaville area in the past, and she couldn\u2019t pass up the chance to help out the small business. \u201cAny little bit helps, and I think that was the coolest part too is just knowing that even from afar, even from Twitter, you can support somebody and help keep their business going in a time like this,\u201d Sandridge said. Discussing UVa sports on Twitter frequently divulges into jokes or conversations about the men\u2019s basketball team\u2019s lineup or where the team might fall in the NCAA Tournament field. This particular interaction went much deeper than sports. \u201cIt\u2019s really more than sports and more about connecting people to one another and really sharing that shared UVa spirit that we all find so special,\u201d Sandridge said. This isn\u2019t the first time the account has helped Pittman through a challenging time. On Selection Sunday in 2013, Pittman\u2019s twins were born about three months early. The Cavaliers fell just shy of the NCAA Tournament that season and were not included in the field on Selection Sunday, as they tried to develop into a powerhouse men\u2019s basketball program on the national stage. Despite slightly less fanfare surrounding the program at the time, Pittman posted about his experience on his Twitter account and was floored by the support from fans. \u201cAll these UVa fans, that are people I\u2019ve never met, were super invested in it and messaging me for updates, asking if they could help in any way or could they send stuff up to the hospital where we were staying, and it just really blew me away,\u201d Pittman said. Seven years later, UVa fans still have Pittman\u2019s back. Pittman is unsure how things might play out with the caf\u00e9, but he says each order comes out to be about the equivalent of 3-5 sandwiches purchased. The support of Virginia fans truly impacts Pittman\u2019s caf\u00e9 and the four employees reliant on the business. From cities across Virginia to places in South Carolina, there\u2019s likely to be a significant increase in Caf\u00e9 By The Bay apparel worn across the country this summer. \u201cUltimately, that small town piece is what drew me in, and I had to help,\u201d Coleman said. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to receiving my Caf\u00e9 By The Bay t-shirt, and I\u2019m gonna wear it proudly.\u201d","340":"The Fellowship of Christian Athletes named Virginia men\u2019s basketball head coach Tony Bennett the 2020 winner of the John Lotz \u201cBarnabas\u201d Award on Monday. The award is given annually to a basketball coach who best exhibits a commitment to Christ, integrity and encouragement to others and lives a balanced life. \u201cThroughout his coaching career, Tony Bennett has exemplified humble servant leadership both on and off the court, and all of us at the Fellowship of Christian Athletes are honored to recognize him,\u201d Shane Williamson, FCA President and CEO, said. Named after former North Carolina assistant and Florida head coach John Lotz, the award has existed since 2003. Other notable winners include John Wooden and former UVa assistant Ritchie McKay. Baylor\u2019s Scott Drew won the honor a season ago. Bennett led the Cavaliers to a 23-7 record in 2019-20 before the season was cut short due to COVID-19. The Cavaliers won their final eight games and finished 15-5 in ACC play. The stellar play came a season after UVa won the national championship. After struggling during the middle portion of the season, Bennett helped the Wahoos regain their footing to finish the year playing its best basketball of the season. Virginia excelled in close games, especially in the final few weeks of the season. UVa\u2019s head coach leads his team through his program\u2019s five pillars of humility, passion, unity, servanthood and thankfulness. Bennett uses those to help guide his coaching. \u201cDuring this uniquely challenging basketball season, this outstanding leader has guided his players in matters much more eternal than the game of basketball,\u201d Williamson said. \u201cTony has led himself, his family and his teams through the most difficult of defeats and the pinnacle of a national championship with amazing grace and consistency that can only come from the Holy Spirit leading his life.\u201d","341":"The Virginia men\u2019s lacrosse team jumped out to a 6-1 lead over Brown, and it appeared as if the Cavaliers would cruise to victory. They led 8-2 before two Brown goals made UVa\u2019s halftime lead 8-4. Regardless, the Cavaliers were in control. Fast forward to the end of the third quarter, and the Wahoos had fallen behind 12-10. Brown scored eight goals in the quarter and eventually held on for a 14-13 win. UVa, which entered the season as the defending national champion with a loaded roster, fell to 4-2 on the season. When the team returned to the hotel, the players met to figure out why a team so talented was falling short. \u201cWe were very close,\u201d junior Regan Quinn said of the team finding its footing. \u201cI remember after the Brown game in the hotel we had a meeting and everyone was basically hashing out what they think was wrong with the team and everything we need to fix. That felt like a unifying moment where we were going to go out and actually put our best version of ourselves on the field, and we all kind of felt that.\u201d Instead, the season was canceled before the next game due to the spread of COVID-19. The program started slowly the year prior, opening the season with a 1-2 record before finding a rhythm and an identity after a few close victories. As the team gained momentum, it played its best lacrosse at the end of the season. An unwavering belief and a few thrilling comebacks propelled the Cavaliers to the national championship. They hoped they could have a similar fate this season after staring 4-2. The team held the pieces to rattle off a winning streak. Alex Rode was consistent in goal. Jared Conners earned All-American honors for his play this season as a long-stick midfielder. Matt Moore was lethal on attack, and Dox Aitken was as steady a midfielder as there is in the nation. Virginia possessed the talent and experience to repeat as national champions. \u201cI just thought we were fearless,\u201d freshman Connor Shellenberger said. \u201cWe kind of embraced the fact that it\u2019s hard to go back to back and not many people do it. We didn\u2019t want to talk about it much, but we embraced the fact that it was hard.\u201d Quinn said the team\u2019s fall practices were the most intense in his three years with the program. The Cavaliers embraced the title of defending champs while also making note that the team was different. Virginia\u2019s players wanted to be remembered as the 2020 Virginia Cavaliers, not the defending champs. They were trying to write their own story. The story ended early than expected, but the Cavaliers return many talented pieces next season. The NCAA\u2019s decision to grant eligibility relief to spring sports athletes also means that the team\u2019s seniors could return. Michael Kraus has already announced that he won\u2019t return next season, but the other seniors\u2019 decisions have yet to be made. When the Cavaliers return to the field next season, they\u2019ll still technically be the returning champions. This time, they won\u2019t have the same pressure, however. \u201cThere might be some benefit that we\u2019ve already gone through that emotion and that\u2019s behind us,\u201d UVa head coach Lars Tiffany said. \u201cAnd, yet, we can move forward in building a team \u2026 I knew it\u2019d be hard, but it was even harder, and so I\u2019m kind of looking forward to starting the season without that, but not having lost.\u201d It was an unceremonious ending to Virginia\u2019s 2020 season, and the Cavaliers felt close to turning a corner. Unfortunately, they\u2019ll never know how the story of the 2020 season would have played out. That doesn\u2019t take away from what the Cavaliers know about the team\u2019s potential. \u201cWe obviously didn\u2019t have the best year as our record would say,\u201d Quinn said. \u201cLooking on paper, it\u2019s probably one of the best teams I\u2019ve ever played on.\u201d","342":"Since 1966, the Jefferson Swim League has celebrated the culmination of its season with its championship meet. The annual swimming showcase will not be held this summer due to health concerns resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. The JSL Board made the announcement Thursday night on its website after a special online meeting was held to discuss the feasibility of holding a full season and championship meet this summer. The board voted unanimously to cancel the championship, in any form, for 2020, ending a run of 54 consecutive years of the event. \u201cThe decision to cancel [the JSL championships was a difficult one for all involved, but it was the right decision,\u201d JSL Vice President Christina Meyer said in a release. \u201cWhatever future decisions the Board makes concerning the scheduled season will keep the health and safety of everyone involved in the swim league the top priority.\u201d This year\u2019s JSL championships were slated for July 24-25 at the University of Virginia Aquatic & Fitness Center. A key factor in the decision is UVa\u2019s ban group activities in its facilities through June 30 as part of Gov. Ralph Northam\u2019s stay at home order. Another factor in the decision was the possibility of no sponsorships from local businesses, which the board said was \u201cvital\u201d for the financial health of the championship meet, which is, by far, the JSL\u2019s most expensive undertaking each season. The JSL Board did not rule out the regular season altogether. In a split vote, the board voted not to cancel the season at this point. They are set to meet again on May 3 and evaluate the situation when more information is available regarding COVID-19.","343":"Jim Harshaw\u2019s first marathon won\u2019t come in front of a big crowd. He won\u2019t receive swag from a marathon event. Harshaw\u2019s marathon isn\u2019t officially sanctioned, but it still counts just the same. A former three-time ACC wrestling champion and a 1999 UVa alumnus, Harshaw planned to run the Pittsburgh Marathon this May with his neighbor Jeff Schwalm, a former Bridgewater College basketball player and current teacher in the Albermarle school district. Instead, COVID-19 caused the cancellation of the event. Rather than giving up midway through their training \u2014 they had logged a training run of 17 miles before the cancellation \u2014 they opted to create their own course staring near their homes in Forest Lakes and ending in downtown Charlottesville. \u201cWe\u2019ve gotten this far,\u201d Harshaw said. \u201cLet\u2019s keep this thing going.\u201d Race day has arrived. Their journey begins at 7 a.m. Saturday and they plan on ending at roughly 10:30 a.m. \u201cWe\u2019re in it for the challenge as much as anything,\u201d Harshaw said. \u201cIt\u2019s as much of a challenge, maybe more of a challenge, doing it on your own without the big crowds and the festive atmosphere.\u201d Running 26.2 miles consecutively challenges even the fittest runners. It\u2019s a long distance that takes the average runner hours to complete, and the race is both a mental and physical test. Luckily for Harshaw, who was an assistant wrestling coach at UVa for a few years and now works as a speaker and performance coach, he and Schwalm have a friend tagging along on a bike at a safe distance to provide both emotional and physical support when needed. They\u2019ll use their mutual friend to act as a hydration station without the typical fueling stations at official marathon events. \u201cHe\u2019s gonna ride his bike along with us because he has nothing better to do, I don\u2019t think, either, so we\u2019re gonna throw some Gatorades and water in his backpack, so that\u2019ll be good,\u201d Harshaw said. Creativity is critical for the makeshift marathon, which won\u2019t include hydration stations, fancy prizes or a raucous crowd. Toward the end of the marathon, however, the runners expect a few family members to make an appearance. Whether it\u2019s a family member or two biking near the runners at a safe distance for the final miles or a few relatives waiting at the finish line, Harshaw and company hope to make the marathon as close to the real thing while also following all legal guidelines regarding social distancing. While it\u2019s not quite summer weather in Charlottesville, Saturday\u2019s forecast looks promising for the runners. The race begins with a temperature in the upper 30s and ends in the lower 50s. There\u2019s minimal wind and plenty of sunshine for the runners. It\u2019ll be a picture-perfect day for the few family members there to greet the runners when they finish. Running offers Harshaw, who has stayed in shape since his wrestling days, an outlet to remain fit while following social distancing protocols. \u201cIt\u2019s been fantastic,\u201d Harshaw said. \u201cIn the early days in the training here was going outside in low and mid 20-degree weather at six o\u2019clock in the morning on Saturdays for a long run. That was kind of brutal, but as we got into the social distancing stuff, the weather\u2019s gotten nicer, which has allowed us to train more comfortably while keeping our social distance.\u201d Harshaw enters Saturday\u2019s unofficial race as an accomplished athlete. He won over 100 matches in his Virginia wrestling career. He became an All-American in 1998-99. He qualified for the NCAA Championships four times and was a three-time intercollegiate Virginia state champion. He isn\u2019t, however, usually one for long runs. Saturday\u2019s marathon is his first, and he hopes his athletic background and mental toughness can help him push through the marathon. \u201cThere\u2019s something that comes with having been a college athlete that makes you feel just at a subconscious level that you can deal with pain and suffering maybe a little better than the average person just because of the crucible experience that college athletics can be,\u201d Harshaw said. Sports are halted across the country, but one former UVa athlete is still coming up with athletic challenges to make it through this unusual time in the sports world.","344":"Thomas Rogers and Akil Mitchell played for Tony Bennett as the Virginia men\u2019s basketball program started to grow into a national power. The former roommates are reuniting this summer in hopes of winning a summer tournament that\u2019s rising in popularity. Since their UVa playing days ended, Rogers started working in finance while Mitchell continued playing basketball professionally. In addition to playing overseas, Mitchell played in The Basketball Tournament, or TBT, a single-elimination 64-team tournament and helped lead a team to the Super 16 in the summer of 2018. The winning team takes home a $2 million prize to split amongst itself. With Rogers looking to find ways to connect the Virginia men\u2019s basketball alumni network, he began thinking about forming a UVa alumni team. Rogers and a few others announced the formation of a team this year, with hopes of competing in the 2020 tournament, which starts on July 23. Mitchell liked to joke with Rogers over the past few years that he wouldn\u2019t be on board to join the team, but the forward ultimately obliged and agreed to join UVa\u2019s 2020 team. \u201cI\u2019m like, dude, if we have a UVa team, you are on the team, OK?\u201d Rogers said. \u201cI just like of left it at that, so he didn\u2019t really have a choice.\u201d Mitchell joins Sean Singletary, Darion Atkins, J.R. Reynolds and Sammy Zeglinski as former Wahoos that Rogers considers \u201chard yes\u2019s\u201d to play on the team. Rogers himself is overseeing the creation of the team, but he won\u2019t take the court as a player. UVa\u2019s alumni team is supported by Hoops2o, which was created by former Virginia basketball star Malcolm Brogdon as part of Chris Long\u2019s Waterboys initiative. If the UVa alumni team won the event and the prize money, $150,000 would go to Hoops2o. Placing a team in the TBT field of 64 is something Rogers wants to do annually as he looks to build the UVa basketball alumni community. He hopes this season is a good first step to building that connection and getting the team\u2019s foot in the door in the tournament. \u201cThat\u2019s kind of the plan is to just do this forever,\u201d Rogers said. \u201cThis is part of a bigger initiative to build a long-term plan for the alumni group. I think it\u2019ll really help to have some continuity and have that every year.\u201d With the tournament slated to begin toward the end of July, TBT is operating under the assumption that it can hold everything as planned this season, even with COVID-19. Eight regional sites and a championship site are sprawled out across the country. Jon Mugar and Dan Friel, co-founders of TBT, are keeping tabs on everything that\u2019s going on in relation to COVID-19, large gatherings and travel restrictions. With months until the tournament\u2019s planned start date, Mugar feels confident the best approach is to continue forward with the expectation of holding everything as planned in late July. \u201cWe have three and a half, four months to go until we play,\u201d Mugar said. \u201cEverything changes so rapidly. I\u2019m very convinced that A) we\u2019ll play in some form and B) the sooner we make a decision, the worse it will be.\u201d Staying the course doesn\u2019t mean TBT will defy health guidelines or risk player safety to put on the event. Mugar believes his organization is small and agile enough to make quick decisions in the event of a necessary cancellation or postponement. With over 100 days until the event, TBT has time to evaluate new data as it comes out before rushing to a postponement or cancellation. Should health restrictions remain in place in July, Mugar\u2019s team will be ready to change course. \u201cIf we run into that, we are developing all these contingency plans now to change and accommodate,\u201d Mugar said. \u201cJust like everyone else, we want to put on an event, but we want to put it on safely and with the blessing of all local government and national government agencies.\u201d With a few months until the open-application even begins, the field of 64 has yet to be officially set as teams apply and the TBT team evaluates which teams will make the field. UVa\u2019s team believes it stands a good chance of making the field. Friel called the selection process more of an art than a science. Unlike the NCAA Tournament, there aren\u2019t NET ratings or various metrics to rank the teams applying, since many of them rarely play together in formal settings. TBT uses three criteria to make informed decisions about which teams earn spots in the field. First, Friel and TBT members look at the team\u2019s potential fan base. More than anything, the co-founders want people tuning in to watch games. That takes a blend of good basketball and well-known players on the court. Second, TBT evaluates reliability. Will the team show up with a full roster and remain committed to the event? Third, a team\u2019s potential quality of play is evaluated. \u201cSome people are surprised that that\u2019s the third criteria, but it really is, that\u2019s how we rank it,\u201d Friel said. \u201cWe want to see a good team compete, obviously, but if it came down to a team that is a little bit lesser in terms of our estimation of quality but that we know and that we know is going to show up, well then we\u2019re certainly going to take the team that was more reliable than the one that might have some better names on paper.\u201d Given the UVa alumni team\u2019s ability to already secure five committed players with a few other leads, the Cavaliers check off the reliability box. The players on the roster either play professionally at the moment or have significant professional experience as well, checking off the box for quality of play. With a recent national championship, the men\u2019s basketball program\u2019s fan base is growing rapidly. \u201cThere [are] obviously some advantages that alumni teams like this UVa team would have over other teams,\u201d Friel said. \u201cThe first one, obviously, is that there\u2019s just hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of University of Virginia basketball fans out there, who I would assume would be excited about seeing these guys play.\u201d TBT believes it can play a tournament this summer, and Virginia believes its team will be in the field. For Rogers, who is moving back to Charlottesville to attend UVa\u2019s school of business in the fall, the tournament represents a chance to build upon the Virginia men\u2019s basketball alumni community. Even if the tournament doesn\u2019t go on as planned or something comes up, Rogers wants UVa fielding a team for years to come. It\u2019s beneficial for the players and alumni, and it also gives the fans a taste of UVa men\u2019s basketball in July. Given the season\u2019s abrupt ending, Virginia fans will gladly take any basketball they can get. \u201cI think it\u2019s a really easy way for us to connect the alumni with a fan base that\u2019s pretty ravenous for basketball at the end of July and early August, especially this year,\u201d Rogers said.","345":"A year ago, fans flocked to Mincer\u2019s for University of Virginia athletic apparel. Whether it was fans visiting the two Charlottesville locations in person or an influx of online orders, business was good in the immediate aftermath of the UVa men\u2019s basketball team\u2019s historic season that ended with a national championship. This year, the popular Charlottesville store that sells UVa merchandise and apparel wasn\u2019t open to customers for an extended period of time for the first time since the 1950s. The spread of COVID-19 forced Mincer\u2019s to move all business online. \u201cLast year this time, we were national champs,\u201d Mark Mincer, the store\u2019s owner, said. \u201cEven a week or two ago last year we were in the Final Four, we were in the Elite Eight or the Sweet 16, and things were really booming.\u201d March 20 was supposed to be a night of first round NCAA Tournament games. Instead, the tournament was canceled and Mincer tweeted that night that both store locations were temporarily closing. , The business now relies solely on online purchases to bring in revenue. It\u2019s a drastic change from a year ago. Students aren\u2019t on grounds. Virginia sports teams aren\u2019t competing. What is usually a busy time for the shop has turned into an extremely slow period. \u201cPeople ask me, \u2018How are online sales doing now?\u2019\u201d Mincer said. \u201cWell, we\u2019re glad to have them \u2014 it\u2019s better than no sales at all \u2014 but it\u2019s hard to compare. You can\u2019t compare to last year. That was crazy.\u201d Mincer\u2019s generates its most revenue in the fall with students on grounds and football games attracting solid weekend crowds. With thousands of fans visiting and students constantly on the corner, Mincer\u2019s does well during the first months of the UVa semester. The store also does well during the spring season with students spending more time outside on the lawn or on the corner as the weather improves. Graduation brings large swaths of people with strong connections to UVa. Some alumni even have reunions around this time that bring them back to Charlottesville and into Mincer\u2019s. With temporarily closed physical locations and stay-at-home orders affecting millions of Americans, those usual revenue streams have come to a standstill for Mincer\u2019s. While in-person sales are halted, the store\u2019s website remains open and customers purchase items on a daily basis. The store relies on promotions to generate interest among customers. Recently, it ran a promotion selling items at 27% off. The number 27 was selected because it represents the number of national championships won by UVa sports teams. \u201cJust trying to get somebody to notice us, basically,\u201d Mincer said of the promotions. \u201cWithout the classes, without the athletic contests, without graduation, without things happening on grounds \u2014 not everybody forgets about us \u2014 but there\u2019s not that natural trigger in the news or in your normal everyday walks of life to make you think about us.\u201d Business is slower, but one product flew off the shelves in recent weeks: jigsaw puzzles. With people spending more time inside to practice social distancing, puzzles were one of the most popular items. The store is currently out of stock and expects puzzles back in the next month or so. \u201cUsually you don\u2019t sell any jigsaw puzzles, some days you sell one or two and then all the sudden you\u2019ll come in on a Monday morning like, \u2018We sold 20 puzzles in a weekend?\u2019\u201d Mincer said. Selling more puzzles gave the 57-year-old Mincer a laugh, but a few extra sales don\u2019t take away the volume of sales lost due to the store\u2019s temporary closure. Mincer is working through the process of applying for federal loans through the Paycheck Protection Program. The program is designed to help small businesses pay employees \u2014 Mincer\u2019s has a number of workers unable to log hours because of the store\u2019s temporary closure \u2014 and bills during this uncertain time. Unfortunately, the program provides little certainty. Whether it\u2019s determining how to apply for a loan or the details of how much money the business might receive from a loan, Mincer says he\u2019s struggled to find clear information on how the process of obtaining funds to help his employees actually works. He\u2019s hopeful to find more clarity in the coming days and weeks. Despite the uncertainty, Mincer believes his business will eventually receive funds from the loan and things will improve. He\u2019s worked at the store for most of his life, helping out the family business as a kid before graduating from UVa in 1985 and eventually taking over as the store\u2019s owner in 2012 following his father Bobby\u2019s death. Mincer believes the store that began by selling tobacco, cigars, pipes and other smoking accessories in 1948 before shifting course and adjusting to customer demands to sell UVa-related apparel can weather this storm. \u201cI think it\u2019s gonna work out,\u201d Mincer said. \u201cI think the loan is going to come and the virus is going to go away and things are gonna get better. I just don\u2019t know when it\u2019s gonna be.\u201d For the time being, Mincer\u2019s has no intention of closing, and it expects to open its stores when it\u2019s safe. \u201cI\u2019ve worked there my whole life,\u201d Mincer said. \u201cMaybe I\u2019m naive, but I can\u2019t imagine us closing.\u201d","346":"A phone call with Tony Bennett and a virtual tour of Virginia\u2019s facilities helped sell Trey Murphy III on the idea of playing at UVa. The Rice transfer, who averaged 13.7 points a season ago, announced his commitment to Bennett and Virginia on Monday, and he\u2019ll sit out next season before playing two years for the Cavaliers. UVa lightly recruited Murphy out of high school, but the talks slowed and Murphy opted to join Rice in Conference USA. He excelled in two seasons with the Owls, shooting 39% from 3-point range and averaging 10.9 points per game across his collegiate career. Entering high school, Murphy was a 5-foot-8 guard. Coming out of high school, Murphy stood at 6-5. He\u2019ll join UVa as a versatile 6-8 wing. UVa\u2019s program took a step forward by winning a national championship since Murphy joined Rice. Murphy also took a jump forward, proving his game at the Division I level and growing three inches. The mutual interest led to a commitment. \u201cI really connected with Coach Bennett on the phone,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cHe\u2019s a really great guy, and I appreciate everything he\u2019s done.\u201d The recruiting process while in the transfer portal became anything but standard. Teams wanted the versatile wing, which led to a lot of phone calls. With Murphy entering the transfer portal toward the end of March, his recruitment came without in-person visits due to COVID-19. Despite the unusual circumstance, teams reached out to Murphy frequently, and he took that as a good sign. He listed Houston, Pittsburgh, Villanova and Virginia as his final four transfer destinations before ultimately choosing the Cavaliers. \u201cIt was pretty crazy,\u201d Murphy said of the process. \u201cI took it as a blessing really. It just shows that a lot of schools value what I do, what I have done and really see a bright future for me, which is really awesome.\u201d UVa didn\u2019t bring the wing to grounds because of current health restrictions, but he initially spoke to assistant coach Jason Williford over the phone before chatting with Bennett. Those calls went well, and then the program gave Murphy a virtual tour of grounds and the facility. Murphy didn\u2019t see the area in person, but the tour impressed. \u201cIt was nice,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cThe facilities there were off the charts. I would have to say probably best in the country. It was beautiful.\u201d Given Murphy\u2019s size and shooting, he\u2019s a budding NBA prospect. UVa\u2019s nice facilities and coaching staff put the school at the top of his list. Versatility is Murphy\u2019s calling card. The wing says he considers himself a 6-8 guard who can play multiple positions. Murphy studies film of Kevin Durant and Jayson Tatum, a pair of NBA players with similar skills. He uses them as players he tries to model his game after as he looks to blossom into an NBA player. Murphy knows his defense needs to improve for him to compete at the next level, which is part of what sold him on playing at UVa. The Cavaliers are well-known for their defensive acumen under Bennett\u2019s guidance. Adding muscle to his 200-pound frame sits atop the list of priorities for Murphy during his redshirt season. He sounded eager to work with UVa\u2019s strength and conditioning coach Mike Curtis to build his body into a more pro-ready physique. Next year\u2019s redshirt season allows Murphy to develop his body, learn UVa\u2019s system and prepare for an ACC season in 2021-22. \u201cIt\u2019s a year full of hard work, and I\u2019m super excited about it,\u201d Murphy said.","347":"The atmosphere plays an important role in making March Madness a beloved tradition. In addition to mid-major teams pulling upsets and seniors competing for the final time, millions of passionate fans tune in every March and early April for a college basketball tournament. This season, players, coaches and fans missed out on the annual tradition due to COVID-19. Among those fans with ACC Tournament or NCAA Tournament plans were UVa fans hoping to see their team replicate last season\u2019s historic success. Instead of watching the Wahoos contend for another national championship, fans were left to watch replays of last year\u2019s madness. \u201cIt\u2019s heartbreaking,\u201d senior commerce major Kristen Kelly said. \u201cIt\u2019s also the emotions of having gone to school with Mamadi [Diakite] for four years and Braxton [Key] for two \u2014 I don\u2019t know either of them personally but you see these guys around grounds, you see them in classes, you see them studying \u2014 you want to also see them succeed, and you want them to do well in the postseason, especially for Mamadi, he\u2019s such a big part of that. It breaks my heart for those guys.\u201d Kelly had plans to attend the ACC Tournament with a group of friends she met through going to UVa basketball games. Instead, the tournament was canceled before UVa took the floor. For the die-hard Virginia fan, it\u2019s been a tough adjustment. She\u2019s used to attending as many home games as possible and watching road games on TV whenever she\u2019s unable to travel to road contests. Kelly, who was studying abroad in Europe during last season\u2019s postseason run, made sure to watch every time UVa took the floor during the Big Dance. \u201cI was studying abroad during the championship, which was the hardest thing ever, but I did stay up and watch every game all across Europe, whether it was at 2 a.m., 3 a.m, the championship ended at 6:30 a.m.,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cI was not gonna miss a second.\u201d During last year\u2019s national title run, third-year law student Jasmine Lee watched with a group of law students in Charlottesville. Lee, who earned her undergraduate degree from UVa in 2016, has also started a tradition with friends of attending the Final Four. She had plans to go to Atlanta for this year\u2019s event, but that was ultimately canceled. While she didn\u2019t attend the Final Four last season \u2014 she wanted to watch the event from Charlottesville \u2014 Lee did attend the Final Four in 2018 even though UVa lost to UMBC well before the Final Four. \u201cWe still went out to San Antonio, and we wore our jerseys around all day,\u201d Lee said. \u201cWe went to the Final Four games and people would come up to us and be like, \u2018Don\u2019t you guys know you\u2019re not here?\u2019 and we\u2019d be like, \u2018Yes, but we\u2019ll be here next year. We\u2019re just a little early. We will be here next year.\u2019\u201d The Cavaliers did make it the next year, winning the national championship as Lee and friends celebrated the night away in Charlottesville. As for Lee\u2019s loose tradition of attending the Final Four, she\u2019s making plans to attend next season. She hopes UVa, which returns key contributors like Kihei Clark and Jay Huff, can make it to the event in 2021. Even if the Cavaliers don\u2019t, Lee is set on going. \u201cWe\u2019ve already made plans to go to Indianapolis,\u201d Lee said. \u201cWe\u2019ve already talked about it. It\u2019s going to happen.\u201d Adjusting to no UVa basketball during March provided a challenge to Cavalier fans. For AB Bugg, a senior economics major, watching UVa games on replay has helped ease the transition away from basketball. The passionate fan made the trip with friends to Louisville last season to watch UVa\u2019s dramatic victory over Purdue in the Elite Eight. That\u2019s one of the games she\u2019s rewatched since classes moved online and basketball season came to a close. Watching the contest brings back memories of the event and the car trip home. \u201cThat was one of the most fun experiences of college for sure,\u201d Bugg said. \u201cWe were also so excited on the way back, too. I just don\u2019t think any of us could believe that we actually got to see their big win to go to the Final Four.\u201d Missing out on postseason basketball stung, but losing out on saying a proper goodbye to classmates hurt the most, according to Bugg. \u201cThe hardest adjustment is definitely living at home now and not getting to be with my friends because we never had that goodbye because we thought we were gonna have a couple more months left,\u201d Bugg said. All three UVa-supporting students missed out on postseason basketball viewing experiences. While they wish they had those opportunities, they\u2019re all looking forward to the Virginia basketball when it does return. \u201cIt\u2019ll just be nice to have that community of people that you can constantly reach out to and have something to talk about and bring you back to those UVa days, because not having it, it does leave a huge hole,\u201d Kelly said.","348":"Karl Kuhn has spent decades around high-level college baseball. The former Florida catcher and longtime assistant coach spent 16 years as Virginia\u2019s pitching coach under Brian O\u2019Connor before accepting Radford\u2019s head coaching position in August. His first season at the helm of a program went unlike any he\u2019d experienced before. The NCAA announced the cancellation of spring sports due to COVID-19 just 17 games into his head coaching tenure. When the announcement came, Radford was finding its stride. The Highlanders (9-8) were winners of five of their past six games, and the one loss was a 9-8 defeat to a ranked Notre Dame squad. \u201cWe got to the point where I promise you that if you were to ask any of our players here at Radford, they would literally tell you that we were about to take off,\u201d Kuhn said. \u201cAs a coach, that is all you hope for is for your team to feel that confident going into any game or situation.\u201d Unfortunately, Kuhn\u2019s managerial role quickly changed from helping steer the team through the ups and downs of a season to becoming a mentor as they tried to work through an unprecedented situation. It\u2019s not quite Kuhn what expected when taking the job. The scenario wasn\u2019t expected, but handling adversity is something Kuhn enjoys about coaching. He wants his baseball team to have success, and while many of Kuhn\u2019s former players have gone on to play professionally, most collegiate athletes don\u2019t become professional athletes. Kuhn wants to help mold his players into better people. With that in mind, he knew the decision to halt sports for safety was a logical one. \u201cObviously you feel bad for everybody involved, mostly the kids and everything that they put into it and had it pulled out from under them, but you want them and invariably you prepare them to be good husbands, good men, good fathers and this is what they need to be preparing to do,\u201d Kuhn said. \u201cYou can\u2019t do that unless you\u2019re healthy.\u201d When Radford eventually returns to the diamond, Kuhn will return to doing what he loves and applying what he learned from 16 years under O\u2019Connor. Kuhn and O\u2019Connor have talked a few times since Kuhn went to Radford, and the new head coach laughed when discussing what it\u2019s like to take on the new role. Previously, Kuhn said, he would sometimes question why O\u2019Connor made decisions. Now, Kuhn says he better understands the challenges of being a head coach and why some decisions were made by O\u2019Connor when running Virginia\u2019s program. \u201cWe\u2019ve talked a couple times back and forth,\u201d Kuhn said. \u201cJust mostly sharing my anecdotes and him probably sitting back in a chair in his office or at home and putting his feet up and laughing.\u201d Despite moving to a new job, Radford is just a couple hours away from Charlottesville. Kuhn isn\u2019t far away, and the two programs were supposed to meet on the diamond on April 15. The new job didn\u2019t keep Kuhn from keeping an eye on UVa\u2019s season and how the team was doing. Kuhn texted pitcher Chesdin Harrington on March 3 after the fifth-year senior struggled to begin the year. He told Harrington that tough times don\u2019t last but tough people do. Texting Harrington was the one time Kuhn allowed himself to reach out to a UVa player during the season. \u201cI have not stayed in touch with the players at Virginia on purpose,\u201d Kuhn said. \u201cI wanted them to divorce themselves from me because I wanted to give their new pitching coach Drew Dickinson 100% the opportunity to have me be gone.\u201d Kuhn, who said he had lunch with Dickinson and called UVa\u2019s new pitching coach \u201ca great guy,\u201d reached out to Harrington because he wanted to let the pitcher know that he loved him and he had his back. Once players like Harrington graduate and leave the UVa program, Kuhn expects their relationship to return to its strong level. \u201cAs they move on, like the juniors sign professionally and they move on, and the seniors are truly done, now they become friends of mine and former players of mine just like anybody else, not players at Virginia,\u201d Kuhn said. \u201cNow my relationship with them can be rekindled.\u201d For Harrington, Kuhn reaching out meant a lot. The duo formed a special bond during Kuhn\u2019s tenure at UVa and Harrington\u2019s stint with the Cavaliers. \u201cHim reaching out and showing his support for me and obviously keeping tabs on our program, I think that says a lot about him as a man,\u201d Harrington said. \u201cThat relationship has been outstanding, and I don\u2019t see it crumbling any time soon. I expect it to last a lifetime.\u201d When Kuhn and Radford return to the diamond, he\u2019ll continue forming those bonds with many of his Radford players. Until then, the veteran assistant and new head coach hopes he and his team stay safe during the global pandemic. \u201cBaseball\u2019s a way for us to try to help them be better men, and in order to do that we\u2019ve got to all be alive, don\u2019t we?\u201d Kuhn said.","349":"The WNBA will take center stage in the sports world Friday night when its draft airs on ESPN at 7 p.m. The draft will be held virtually due to COVID-19, but the league\u2019s 12 teams will partake in the three-round event, meaning 36 up-and-coming players take a step closer toward their dreams of competing in the WNBA. One of those prospects is Virginia\u2019s Jocelyn Willoughby. The 6-foot wing led the ACC in scoring at 19.2 points per game this season and averaged 7.7 rebounds per contest. She\u2019s also one of the better 3-point shooters in the country. \u201cJocelyn will get drafted,\u201d ESPN analyst Rebecca Lobo said. \u201cThe question is just going to be where.\u201d Willoughby is set to become the first UVa player selected in the WNBA Draft since Monica Wright went second overall in the 2010 draft. Willoughby\u2019s projected draft location varies, but most experts place her in the early or middle part of the second round. Ben Dull, a women\u2019s basketball writer who contributes to High Post Hoops, BBall Index and The Basketball Writers, took Willoughby off the board at No. 10 in his latest mock draft. He sent Willoughby to the Phoenix Mercury. While Dull admitted some might consider Willoughby going in the first round to be a reach, he believes her shooting, defense and size make her an ideal candidate to join a team like Phoenix, which is in need of a contributor on the wing. \u201cJocelyn had an awesome season,\u201d Dull said. \u201cShe\u2019s knocking down the jump shot. Obviously, it\u2019s important. We beat it to death with everyone, right? But it is important because when you\u2019re the No. 1 option in college \u2014 and obviously almost no one is going to do that in the same way at the next level \u2014 you have to be able to be a complementary player, and a big part of that is can you be a threat, are people going to care if you\u2019re just standing there on the wing?\u201d That\u2019s where Willoughby\u2019s shooting provides tremendous value. The UVa star shot 38.8% from the 3-point line over her four-year career and that number comes even with a sub-par shooting season as a freshman. She made just 20.5% of her 3-point shots in her first collegiate season. Over the next three seasons, she made a combined 111 shots from beyond the arc and shot at least 39.8% from 3-point range in each of those seasons. She also shot at least 85% from the free-throw line in her final three seasons. For comparison, only six WNBA players shot above 40% from the 3-point line in the last regular season. \u201cI think definitely her game translates,\u201d Lobo said. \u201cHer body translates. She can score at a high clip and high efficiency from the three-point line. She can take it to the basket. She\u2019s got a good frame. She\u2019s a good finisher. She gets to the free throw line. A lot of potential.\u201d According to both Lobo and Dull, teams want potential. Many of the best women\u2019s basketball players also play overseas during the WNBA offseason to maximize their earning potential. They also develop their skills in those leagues. WNBA teams want prospects with potential to come in and contribute, while also developing into elite professional players. Given the size of the league, it\u2019s hard to make a WNBA roster. There are only 12 teams, whereas men\u2019s players who turn pro have a chance to land on one of 30 NBA teams or a G-League team. Women\u2019s players don\u2019t have that luxury. \u201cYou\u2019re not turning over that many roster spots because it\u2019s a smaller league, so players 8-12 on a roster, they\u2019re better than the players in the final spot in other leagues,\u201d Dull said. Willoughby knows her work is cut out for her once she joins a WNBA team. The league is filled with the best women\u2019s basketball players in the world and just the process of earning a roster spot, even as a first-round pick, is a challenge. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a lot of elite players and just talent across the board, veterans, rookies, international players,\u201d Willoughby said. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s really looking at myself in the mirror and being solid and knowing what I can do, what value I can give and just being solid and consistent in those things.\u201d For Willoughby, that means efficient offense and competitive defense will be at the forefront of how she contributes to a team. Tina Thompson, Willoughby\u2019s coach at Virginia, knows what it takes to succeed in the WNBA. The No. 1 pick in the 1997 WNBA Draft, Thompson won four WNBA Championships and made nine WNBA All-Star Game appearances, including one as recently as 2013. Thompson believes Willoughby has what it takes to succeed in the WNBA in large part due to the wing\u2019s demeanor. \u201cShe\u2019s one of those players that whatever opportunities she\u2019s gonna be given, she\u2019s gonna take advantage of that, but also can have the understanding to be patient and wait her turn,\u201d Thompson said. Willoughby\u2019s turn to star in the WNBA might be years away, but her turn to take the spotlight as a WNBA Draft pick comes Friday night. After that, she wants to make sure she makes the opportunity given to her by a WNBA franchise last. \u201cI want to be able to play in the WNBA,\u201d Willoughby said. \u201cIt means so much because there [are] so many people vying for those few limited spots.\u201d","350":"While spring practices remain postponed due to COVID-19, the college football news cycle keeps chugging along. The Virginia football team added Ronnie Walker Jr., a transfer running back from Indiana, on Friday. He adds depth and talent to a position group in need of both. The Cavaliers also have a few players with the potential to be selected in next week\u2019s NFL Draft. Without spring ball, replacing those impact players could certainly be a challenge. Shortly after Walker Jr.\u2019s announcement, Virginia offensive coordinator Robert Anae, co-defensive coordinator Nick Howell and special teams coordinator Ricky Brumfield joined media members for a previously scheduled Zoom call to discuss the Cavaliers ahead of the upcoming season. Depth increase Anae and the offense add Indiana transfer Ronnie Walker Jr. to a backfield in need of depth. The newcomer joins UVa with two years of eligibility remaining, and the Cavaliers hope he\u2019s able to earn an NCAA waiver to play immediately in 2020. Without a waiver, Walker Jr. would sit out a season. Walker Jr. joins Wayne Taulapapa and Mike Hollins in the running back room. Last season, quarterback Bryce Perkins handled the bulk of the rushing load. With Perkins graduated and heading to the NFL, Virginia likely needs better rushing production from Taulapapa, Hollins and potentially Walker Jr. to find offensive balance. \u201cYes, we do need a better balanced run attack,\u201d Anae said. \u201cI do believe that\u2019s the direction we\u2019re headed, but that too has got to be something that\u2019s earned. Just to run the ball, it is pointless unless it actually is contributing to the team.\u201d Last season, Virginia averaged 3.8 yards per rushing attempt and 7.2 yards per passing attempt. The Cavaliers racked up 267.1 passing yards per game compared to just 121.2 rushing yards per contest. Perkins excelled on the ground for the Cavaliers and replacing him won\u2019t be easy. It also won\u2019t be easy to replace the quarterback\u2019s passing. Brennan Armstrong is the front runner for the starting quarterback position, and Anae sounded confident in the left-handed signal caller. \u201cHe is a program vet,\u201d Anae said of the redshirt sophomore. The coordinator wouldn\u2019t commit to naming Armstrong the starter, though. \u201cWe have not named a starting quarterback \u2014 obviously Brennan is a prime candidate there \u2014 but whoever that quarterback will be when we play Georgia, I\u2019m confident that he will be a player that represents the university and I think our fans will really look forward to breaking in this new group,\u201d Anae said. Defensive experience Virginia\u2019s defense returns a large group of important contributors. On the defensive line, players like Mandy Alonso, Richard Burney and Jowon Briggs return. At linebacker, Charles Snowden, Noah Taylor and Zane Zandier return. In the secondary, Joey Blount and De\u2019Vante Cross are two key players who lead an experienced group of defensive backs. While the talent and experience is clear, UVa\u2019s defense struggled at the end of last season with injuries mounting and elite offenses appearing on the schedule. The Cavaliers gave up at least 27 points in seven consecutive games to finish the season, and Clemson and Florida combined to score 98 points in UVa\u2019s final two games of the season. \u201cThose reps are valuable,\u201d Howell said. \u201cWe have a bad taste in our mouth right now. We\u2019ve been able to watch the Clemson game multiple times as a staff and with our players. We\u2019ve been able to watch the Florida game multiple times with staff and players. We did some good things, but we did some things where we didn\u2019t put our best out there.\u201d Assuming the season starts as scheduled, the Cavaliers open with a Georgia team projected to contend for an SEC title. Before September ends, UVa travels to Clemson. A week later, the Cavaliers face UNC and star quarterback Sam Howell. For UVa to contend for a Coastal Division crown again in 2020, the Cavaliers need their defense to perform at a higher level against the best offenses on their schedule. Returner needed With Joe Reed graduated and heading to the NFL, UVa will have to replace the best kickoff return man in program history. \u201cThere\u2019s no replacing Joe Reed,\u201d Brumfield said. \u201cJoe Reed is one of a kind, and there probably will never be a Joe Reed at UVa again. The only thing we can do is try to get someone or a couple of people to try to replace the numbers that he was able to put up.\u201d According to Brumfield, Tavares Kelly Jr. looks like the No. 1 option at kick returner to start the season. Brumfield likes what Kelly Jr. brings to the position. Kelly Jr. returned eight kicks a season ago for an average of 22.4 yards per return, but Brumfield says the average was deflated by a poor return or two. He thinks Kelly Jr. can average closer to 25 yards per return. At punt returner, Billy Kemp seems like the clear-cut No. 1 choice for the Cavaliers when they next take the field. \u201cBilly is a really good confident punt returner,\u201d Brumfield said. \u201cHe has that swag, that confidence and that maturity and also that person that doesn\u2019t let the bright lights get to him.\u201d Brumfield shared that Nash Griffin will return at punter. There was some speculation that Griffin might leave to pursue professional opportunities outside of football, but the punter plans on returning for a final season. Despite being the starting punter last season, placekicker Brian Delaney wants a chance to compete for the starting punter position. \u201cNash was the guy last year and he did a great job and he very well can be the guy again this year, but Delaney is on a mission to try to take over punts as well,\u201d Brumfield said. There are moving parts and questions for UVa\u2019s offense, defense and special teams units. Unfortunately for the Cavaliers, those answers might take a few months to become clear.","351":"The Phoenix Mercury selected Virginia\u2019s Jocelyn Willoughby with the No. 10 pick in the first round of the 2020 WNBA Draft on Friday night. She was traded to the New York Liberty later in the evening. The New Jersey native will begin her WNBA career in Brooklyn for a team she grew up watching. Willoughby\u2019s selection makes her the first Cavalier since Monica Wright was in 2010 to be picked in the WNBA Draft. Wright, now a UVa women\u2019s basketball assistant coach, went second overall a decade ago. \u201cIt was just emotional, exciting, and it\u2019s kind of like a dream come true,\u201d Willoughby said. Willoughby joins the Liberty after leading the ACC in scoring during her senior season. She projects as a small forward at the professional level, and she averaged 19.2 points and 7.7 rebounds per game in her final collegiate season. Her blend of shooting \u2014 she shot 41.6% from beyond the arc this season \u2014 size and defense make her an ideal pro prospect. Willoughby finished well near the rim during her WNBA career, and she frequently earned trips to the free-throw line. She converted at an 87% clip at the line during her final season in Charlottesville. The talented combo guard joins No. 1 overall pick Sabrina Ionescu out of Oregon as new additions to the Liberty. Ionescu is expected to become the face of the New York franchise, and Willoughby fits in as a versatile wing alongside the elite talent of Ionescu. New York added a handful of young players in the draft, including three players selected in the top 10. After a 10-24 season, the Liberty hope an infusion of young talent leads to improved results. \u201cI was just really excited,\u201d Willoughby said. \u201cI think that I will fit in really well. Obviously the coaching staff is new and just the culture that they\u2019re trying to build in Brooklyn is one that I\u2019m excited about.\u201d The WNBA season was slated to begin on May 15, but is currently delayed due to COVID-19. The league is keeping tabs on the coronavirus and social distancing protocols across the country as it attempts to determine a date when it can begin its next season.","352":"Doolittle, who is currently in Florida with his wife Eireann Dolan, is making the most of the quarantine. From using one his dogs, Sophia, as a weight for lunges, to posting Q&A videos with Dolan about their lives, Doolittle\u2019s quarantine includes plenty of fun. The Nationals reliever and former UVa standout shared a few recommendations for others to make the most of their quarantines. Book Recommendation: \u201cThe Wise Man\u2019s Fear\u201d by Patrick Rothfuss Doolittle loves to read and he frequently posts on social media about the books he\u2019s reading. Dolan even hosted a fake talk show Thursday called \u201cIt\u2019s Lit with Eireann\u201d that the Nationals posted to Twitter. Reading is commonplace during their usual lives, and especially during their Florida quarantine. Recently, Doolittle finds himself reading \u201cThe Wise Man\u2019s Fear\u201d by Patrick Rothfuss. It\u2019s the second book in The Kingkiller Chronicles. The third book in the series has yet to be released, and the first book is titled \u201cThe Name of the Wind.\u201d \u201cIn like the fantasy fiction genre that I love to nerd out in, they\u2019re considered classics,\u201d Doolittle said. \u201cThey\u2019re not that old, they\u2019re relatively recent, but they\u2019re like staples of the genre and they\u2019re a little bit longer books, so I had been procrastinating and putting them off.\u201d With more free time on his hands, Doolittle decided he didn\u2019t have any excuses to put off reading the series, so he dove into the books. He called the books \u201cincredible\u201d and recommends them to anyone who enjoyed reading \u201cA Game of Thrones\u201d or \u201cLord of the Rings.\u201d Given their length, Doolittle considers the books ideal for this time period with many across the country expecting to spend a few more weeks or months inside following social distancing guidelines. Movie\u00a0 Recommendation:\u00a0\u201cParasite\u201d Movies aren\u2019t quite Doolittle\u2019s area of expertise, especially compared to books, but the left-handed pitcher did suggest \u201cParasite.\u201d The 2019 film took home four Academy Awards, including Best Picture. \u201cIn spring training, before everything shut down, we saw \u2018Parasite,\u2019 and I absolutely loved it,\u201d Doolittle said. \u201cI think that\u2019s available now to stream, so people should check that out.\u201d Show Recommendations:\u00a0\u201cOzark\u201d and \u201cThe Sopranos\u201d \u201cOzark,\u201d which stars Jason Bateman and Laura Linney, is a Netflix show with three seasons currently released. The latest season came out at the end of March. The crime drama follows Bateman, who participates in a money laundering scheme, and his family as they navigate a crime-filled life in the Ozarks. \u201cI just finished \u2018Ozark\u2019 and I loved it,\u201d Doolitle said. \u201cI thought season 3 was really good. I thought it was the best season yet.\u201d While \u201cThe Sopranos\u201d ended in 2007, the New Jersey native had never watched the six-season show despite its many awards and accolades. \u201cGrowing up in New Jersey, when I went away to college or in pro ball, people found out I was from New Jersey and they were like, \u2018Oh, Sopranos,\u2019\u201d Doolittle said. \u201cI don\u2019t know, for some reason, I was just like, I\u2019m not gonna give in to that stereotype, I\u2019m not gonna watch it. But I finally watched it, and it\u2019s got to be the best show I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d Home exercise Recommendation:\u00a0Creativity with stairs Doolittle says he\u2019s using the stairs going down to his back patio for a variety of different exercises. If you have access to stairs, Doolittle recommends using them to safely exercise without having to buy dumbbells or other exercise equipment. \u201cI do my calf stretches there,\u201d Doolittle said. \u201cYou can do different step ups,\u00a0 one or two steps at a time depending on how frisky you\u2019re feeling.\u201d Additional creativity can allow for one-foot hops up and down the stairs to work on balance and strength. Doolittle recommends a little more caution when doing those. \u201cMake sure you have a railing, though, so you can balance yourself,\u201d Doolittle laughed. He also uses the stairs to jump down off a few steps to practice landing and absorbing the impact of the ground. He says that\u2019s crucial for him as a pitcher as he drives his right foot into the ground as he strides toward home plate. \u201cI\u2019ve gotten a lot work out of the back steps,\u201d Doolittle said. \u201cI\u2019m sure my neighbors probably think I\u2019m crazy, but it\u2019s been going well so far.\u201d Meal\u00a0 Recommendation:\u00a0Vegan chickpea burritos Dolan\u2019s cooking skills far surpass those of her husband. While Doolittle\u2019s talents don\u2019t extend to the kitchen, he\u2019s grateful for his wife\u2019s ability to create delicious and healthy meals. \u201cLeft to my own devices, I would probably just eat Cinnamon Toast Crunch all day,\u201d Doolittle said. She\u2019s a vegan, so Doolittle says they\u2019re eating extremely healthy food during quarantine, which comes as an added bonus for the professional athlete. Recently, Dolan made vegan chickpea burritos that include sweet potatoes and broccoli. While Doolittle was unsure of the full recipe, he recommended tweeting at Dolan at her Twitter handle (@EireannDolan) if you\u2019re in need of any creative and healthy recipe ideas. Music\u00a0 Recommendation:\u00a0Billy Strings The 27-year-old bluegrass musician from Michigan is a recent favorite of Doolitte\u2019s. Born William Apostol, Billy Strings has gained popularity in recent years, and Doolittle enjoys the artist\u2019s work even though he doesn\u2019t usually listen to much music from the genre. \u201cHe does some incredible covers of some folks songs and some bluegrass songs,\u201d Doolittle said. \u201cHis work on the guitar is incredible. He\u2019s got an amazing voice.\u201d Doolittle enjoys the tempo of Strings\u2019 work and listens to the songs during some of his creative at-home workouts. Plans when quarantine ends For the final question, Doolittle shared what he would do if he was in Charlottesville and stay-at-home and social distancing orders were lifted. In essence, what would his first action be given a return to normalcy in the Charlottesville area? \u201cGo to Bodo\u2019s,\u201d Doolittle said. \u201cGo to Bodo\u2019s and I\u2019d get a sausage, egg and cheese and a coffee and just like sit there. Post up, bring a book maybe, grab a paper, do the crossword, people watch a little bit. Just spend a couple hours in the morning enjoying life resuming as normal.\u201d","353":"Jocelyn Willoughby sat in her living room with her immediate family on Friday night. Due to COVID-19 and social distancing restrictions, her WNBA Draft party only featured a few people. Willoughby used creative thinking to share the moment with those who helped her become a WNBA prospect. She set up a Zoom call with her former coaches and teammates so they could share the experience of being selected in the WNBA Draft with her. With the 10th pick in the 2020 WNBA Draft, the Phoenix Mercury picked Jocelyn Willoughby. \u201cI kind of organized at the last minute a Zoom call and just invited literally coaches who taught me how to do my first layup to my college coaches and teammates that I\u2019ve had along the way,\u201d Willoughby said. \u201cBasically through Zoom everybody else called in \u2014 everybody who\u2019s not in my immediate family \u2014 but that was really cool to just see their reactions on the screen and hear them speak a few words afterward.\u201d Shortly after being selected by the Mercury, Willoughby was traded to the New York Liberty. She\u2019ll join No. 1 overall pick Sabrina Ionescu in Brooklyn whenever WNBA training camp begins. The pick made Willoughby the first UVa player since Monica Wright to be chosen in the draft. Wright went second overall in 2010. When Wright joined UVa\u2019s staff this season as an assistant, she told Willoughby on the first day they met that the senior wing was going to be a WNBA Draft pick. Wright was one of the coaches on the Zoom call. \u201cShe kinda was just like, \u2018I can\u2019t say too much right now because I don\u2019t want to start crying, but so, so proud of you,\u2019\u201d Willoughby said. \u201c\u2018Proud of all the hard work and sacrifices that you\u2019ve made to get to this point and this is just the beginning for you.\u2019 We\u2019ll definitely reconnect when things are a little less emotional, but obviously very thankful for her and to share that moment with her and many other coaches and players and family members.\u201d While Willoughby discussed her excitement for joining a veteran squad in Phoenix during an on-air interview on ESPN, joining New York comes with plenty of perks. Under new head coach Walt Hopkins, New York is in the midst of a rebuild. Given the influx of young talent added in the draft, the roster won\u2019t look like it did a season ago when the Liberty went 10-24. In come Ionescu and Willoughby and a handful of young stars, including UConn\u2019s Megan Walker, a Richmond native. New York will play its next season in the Barclays Center, the same arena Joe Harris and the Brooklyn Nets play their games. It\u2019s a team looking to become a popular and successful WNBA franchise, and the additions in the draft set New York up for its desired success. Given the sheer volume of young stars now on the roster, the rebuild in New York might not take very long. \u201cI think we\u2019ll be young, but young teams are often exciting to watch and have a lot of growth and just potential,\u201d Willoughby said. \u201cI\u2019m really, really excited about it.\u201d Playing in New York keeps Willoughby close to home. The New Jersey native lives about an hour from Brooklyn, and she grew up attending Liberty games. She clarified that she wasn\u2019t a season-ticket holder or anything growing up, but she went to games through class field trips and considers the Liberty her hometown team. Now she\u2019ll play for them. \u201cJust knowing that they\u2019re the local team and to play on it is special for me,\u201d Willoughby said. When WNBA training camp begins, Willoughby will team up with three other ACC players drafted by the Liberty as well as UConn\u2019s top draft pick and Ionescu, who is considered a generational WNBA talent. UVa\u2019s talented wing will compete on a star-studded professional team that plays closest to home. It\u2019s a dream come true for one of the top UVa players of the past decade. \u201cIt just means the world, and I think all the years of hard work \u2014 and granted at that time I didn\u2019t know where I would be going or even that I would be in the WNBA \u2014 but to see everything come full circle is really humbling,\u201d Willoughby said, \u201cand I just feel so blessed to have this opportunity.\u201d","354":"Coming out of high school, Virginia forward Jay Huff drew comparisons to former Wisconsin star Frank Kaminsky. The comparisons made sense. Both players stand at approximately 7 feet tall, and they both possess a rare blend of shooting, scoring and defense that most players their size simply can\u2019t replicate. During Huff\u2019s junior season of high school, the 7-foot Kaminsky led the Badgers to the national championship game and won the Naismith Men\u2019s College Player of the Year award as he displayed an array of low post moves combined with elite 3-point shooting. Maybe most impressively, he committed just two fouls per 40 minutes while defending the rim. Kaminsky wasn\u2019t always a star, though. When he arrived at Wisconsin, he was a prospect with loads of potential and plenty of work ahead. Much like Huff, the height was there, but Kaminsky needed to add muscle to his frame while polishing his game on both ends of the floor. Huff came to Charlottesville in a similar situation. He weighed in at below 200 pounds when he committed to UVa. The potential was evident, but Huff needed to turn potential into reality. Through four years in Charlottesville and three seasons taking the floor for UVa, Huff has flashed signs of dramatic improvement. Checking in at about 240 pounds now, he averaged 8.5 points, 6.2 rebounds and two blocks per game this season for UVa in 25 minutes of action per contest. Huff\u2019s best basketball came at the end of the season, as the talented 7-footer played aggressively on both ends of the floor. \u201cI definitely think I got way more confident,\u201d Huff said. \u201cCoach Bennett\u2019s system is obviously really good, but I also think I was just getting to the point where I didn\u2019t think about it as much. I would get to points in games where I was on the floor for long periods of time and I would kind of go into autopilot and I wouldn\u2019t have to think and I was able to just figure that out, which I think was really good.\u201d Heading into his redshirt senior season, can the big man make a leap similar to Kaminsky, going from a talented piece on a good team to one of the best players in all of college basketball? T he decision For Huff to take leap, he obviously needs to return to Virginia. It seems unlikely that Huff would leave Virginia for the NBA this offseason. Given the modern NBA game\u2019s reliance on guard and wing play, a center averaging fewer than 10 points per game in all three seasons suiting up for the Cavaliers makes Huff a slightly risky pick in the NBA Draft. While Huff turning professional might not be expected, with the uncertainty surrounding sports amid the spread of COVID-19, nothing is guaranteed in the future. Huff could decide he wants to turn pro and start working on his game as a professional, even if that means starting his career in the G-League. Huff turning pro would be a surprise, however, as he stands to improve his NBA Draft stock dramatically if he returns to school and improves his scoring average and free-throw shooting percentage next season. The development Huff\u2019s development as a redshirt junior showed up prominently at the end of the season. In what turned out to be one of the last games of the year, Huff finished a rebound shy of a triple double against Duke. He became only the second player in college basketball history to block 10 shots against the Blue Devils. The ability to protect the rim came through crystal clear in the win over Duke. A few days later, Huff flashed his offensive skills. He scored Virginia\u2019s first 17 points in a 46-44 win over Miami, knocking down 3-pointers and showing different facets of his offensive arsenal. In a two-game stretch in late February and early March, Huff showed why UVa fans light up when discussing Huff\u2019s potential. \u201cJay\u2019s capable \u2014 you saw against Miami he had 17 points quick \u2014 he\u2019s capable of scoring as everyone knows, but I think his defense really stepped up this year,\u201d former Virginia guard Braxton Key said. Numbers support Key\u2019s claim. According to college basketball reference, Huff posted the best defensive rating of any player in Division I basketball to play at least 20 minutes per game and play in at least 25 games this season. Per 40 minutes, Huff averaged 3.3 blocks. \u201cI like to think that the defense spoke for itself and that the way I was able to help the team was impactful,\u201d Huff said. When compared to Kaminsky, Huff matches up favorably as a defender. Kaminsky never posted a defensive rating as good as Huff\u2019s in his four seasons at Wisconsin. Kaminsky also never averaged more than 2.6 blocks per 40 minutes in a season during his career. Huff averages 3.4 blocks per 40 minutes across his collegiate career. Huff does commit more fouls per 40 minutes, however, whereas Kaminsky did an exceptional job defending without fouling. Offensively, Kaminsky\u2019s output surpasses Huff\u2019s, but the efficiency numbers are similar. Kaminsky shot 36.9% from 3-point range during his collegiate career, while Huff shoots 38.5% from beyond the arc. Huff also shoots 67.8% on 2-point shots, while Kaminsky shot 58% from inside the arc in his collegiate career. Kaminsky, however, shot the ball significantly more frequently in his final two seasons than Huff has in any of his three seasons in Charlottesville. The Wisconsin star averaged 9.8 and 12.5 shots per game in his final seasons, while Huff has yet to exceed 6.1 shots per game in a single season. The leap ESPN released an article on April 7 listing the top 25 returning Division I men\u2019s players for next season, and Huff earned the No. 12 spot. For the 7-foot star to reach that potential and become one of the best players in the game next season, he simply needs to be on the court more. In Kaminsky\u2019s breakout senior campaign, he averaged 33.6 minutes per game and shot 12.5 times per game. This season Huff averaged 25 minutes per contest and shot 6.1 times per game. If Huff doubled his shot attempts to come closer to Kaminsky\u2019s 12.5 shots per contest, Huff would\u2019ve averaged about 17 points per contest this season. In fact, Huff averaged 15 points per game in the five games this season when he took double-digit shot attempts. Huff played in all 30 of UVa\u2019s games this season, but he only started 18 and he played fewer than 20 minutes in seven of those games. He also had six games where he attempted two or fewer shot attempts. With Mamadi Diakite and Key out of the frontcourt picture next season, it opens up an opportunity for Huff to log more minutes and put up more shots. Given his general offensive efficiency throughout his career, it wouldn\u2019t be surprising to see Huff take a drastic leap forward in terms of points and shots per game. Even with UVa\u2019s slow tempo and offensive-minded small forward Sam Hauser coming into the fold, there should be plenty of shots to go around. In Kaminsky\u2019s senior campaign he averaged 18.8 points per game and Wisconsin ranked as one of the 10 slowest teams in all of Division I basketball according to KenPom\u2019s adjusted tempo metric. Small forward Sam Dekker attempted 10.2 shots per contest that season, as Kaminsky was far from the only offensive threat on that Wisconsin roster. Virginia\u2019s 7-foot star took a leap forward this season, especially defensively. The improvement earned Huff more time on the court as the season progressed, as he logged at least 28 minutes in seven of the last 10 games of the season. In those seven games, Huff averaged 11.3 points, 7.9 rebounds and 3.4 blocks per game on 56.4% shooting from the field on about eight shot attempts per game. \u201cHe worked at it every single day, after practice, before practice, just trying to be better,\u201d Key said of Huff\u2019s defense. \u201cFor him to take the leap he did this year, it was huge.\u201d Improved defense and a need for a new frontcourt scorer make Huff appear poised for a special 2020-21 campaign.","355":"Mandy Alonso beat his man, grabbed at Hendon Hooker\u2019s jersey and started wrestling the quarterback to the ground. Hooker lost control of the football, and Eli Hanback jumped on it in the end zone for a touchdown to put Virginia in front of Virginia Tech 39-30. Hanback\u2019s touchdown iced the game and helped break a 15-year losing streak to the Hokies. Hanback\u2019s score, as well as his four-year career in Charlottesville, won\u2019t soon be forgotten by UVa faithful. While he\u2019s forever entrenched as a Charlottesville football legend for his touchdown, Hanback\u2019s attention now turns toward playing in the NFL. \u201cScoring that touchdown against Virginia Tech is a feeling I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve ever felt before in my life,\u201d Hanback said. \u201cEveryone says it\u2019s those moments where stuff goes quiet around you and you don\u2019t hear anything else. It was one of those moments, like it was unbelievable. I can\u2019t describe it, but getting drafted on the other hand would also be a dream come true and something that very few people get to experience.\u201d Despite solid production and size at the defensive tackle spot, Hanback is not expected to be drafted in this week\u2019s NFL Draft, according to most draft experts. The defensive tackle joins his teammate, linebacker Jordan Mack, as UVa defensive seniors not receiving much draft buzz. Mock drafts frequently place Mack into the final round or two of this year\u2019s NFL Draft, but an ankle injury cost Mack most of the ACC Championship Game and all of the Orange Bowl. He expected to compete at Virginia\u2019s Pro Day, but it was canceled due to COVID-19. Early in the season, Mack\u2019s stock seemed to be skyrocketing as his sack total grew each week and he roamed the defense making plays. Given his leadership ability and academic prowess, Mack seemed destined to be a mid-round pick. His injury hurt that stock. Fortunately for both Hanback and Mack, they put four years of play of film, so missing a chance to run a 40-yard dash or compete in drills doesn\u2019t ruin their NFL prospects. \u201cYou just leave it all out there on the film, and that\u2019s what it\u2019s all about,\u201d Mack said. \u201cYour film speaks volumes, and at the end of the day, that\u2019s what you do, you play football.\u201d Mack also received an invite to the NFL Combine in February. While Mack couldn\u2019t compete, teams had a chance to test the linebacker\u2019s ankle and check up on his health. This helped calm some concerns among teams. He returned to 100% health in March. When healthy, Mack proved to be a force. He finished his senior season with 69 tackles and 7.5 sacks. He was one of the most productive linebackers in the country when it came to sacking the quarterback. Hanback finished the year with 36 tackles, including 8.5 tackles for loss and 4.5 sacks. While his production doesn\u2019t jump off the page, the big defensive lineman proved to be consistent and durable during his time in Charlottesville. At 6-foot-4 and 300 pounds, Hanback\u2019s size makes him an intriguing prospect for NFL teams. He played well in UVa\u2019s 3-4 scheme and possesses the physical tools needed to succeed. He showed versatility as someone capable of playing on the edge or in the nose tackle position. \u201cWhat I\u2019ve heard mostly from the beginning is that a lot of the 3-4 teams like me, just because that was our base defense here,\u201d Hanback said. Hanback says his strength is stopping the run, and he and NFL personnel have acknowledged he needs pass rushing improvement moving forward. Given his size and collegiate production, it\u2019s likely Hanback earns at least a mini camp tryout with a team. Both Hanback and Mack helped lay the ground work to make UVa a successful ACC football program. They\u2019re hoping to earn a shot with an NFL team in the coming days to keep their football careers alive. Hanback mentioned being a Philadelphia Eagles fan growing up, saying it would be special to play for them. Even though Hanback\u2019s heart might hope for a shot with the Eagles, he just wants a chance to show what he can do. His career with the Cavaliers is over, and he\u2019s ready for what\u2019s to come. \u201cAnyone who wants to give me an opportunity to play is gonna be my team now,\u201d Hanback said. \u201cThat\u2019s where my head\u2019s at.\u201d","356":"When Justin Anderson and Ty Jerome founded Locker Room Access, the duo wanted fans to receive an inside look at everything about the Virginia basketball program. From the players to the coaches to the families and friends that make up the program, Locker Room Access wanted to shed light on the Cavaliers. With the sports world on hold due to COVID-19 and people losing jobs and some losing their lives, Locker Room Access wanted to help, while still giving fans access to the people who make up the UVa men\u2019s basketball program. The platform, which includes a website, discussion forum, shop and podcast, will host an NBA 2K Tournament in the coming weeks. The video game tournament will benefit Aramark employees who work at UVa and are losing out on wages due to UVa\u2019s grounds and sporting events temporarily shutting down. The event also coincides with an auction of various memorabilia, including a signed Ty Jerome Phoenix Suns jersey and a 2019 national championship hat signed by Jerome. Other items include the chance to bid for entry into the 2K Tournament and a chance to compete against Jerome in one of the practice rounds for the event. Fans can bid for a similar item with their practice round coming against manager Grant Kersey. There\u2019s also a raffle to play a practice round against Kyle Guy or Anderson. Every $1 donated serves as one raffle ticket for a chance to play the two former UVa stars while the winner also earns a spot in the tournament. Every dollar raised from the auction goes directly to the Aramark employees affected by the loss of wages. The tourney comes after UVa separately announced a $2 million emergency assistance fund for contract employees and workers who have been furloughed. Aramark employees were among those furloughed. \u201cWe feel like it\u2019s a great opportunity for these guys to show love and support the other way,\u201d said TW Huang, a 1999 UVa alumnus and business partner with Locker Room Access. \u201cIt\u2019s always fans coming, supporting them. This is the other way around.\u201d Mark Jerome, Ty\u2019s father and an accomplished basketball coach in the New York area, also helps with Locker Room Access. He hosts the platform\u2019s podcasts with Huang, and the two discussed raising money for hourly workers in the UVa community who are out of work during a recent podcast. After Mark saw Ty in a 2K Tournament, he suggested to Huang that they do that for charity. Huang, who works at Twitch, liked the idea and the ability to live stream the games through Twitch for fans to watch and engage with the former UVa athletes in the tournament. \u201cWe\u2019re hoping this really can help save some people or support some people through a really rough time,\u201d Mark Jerome said. The idea is turning into a reality in the next week. There\u2019s an extensive list of UVa athletes registered for the tournament, which starts April 30 after practice rounds this weekend. The bracket will be released Monday. On the football side, athletes like Joe Reed, Hasise Dubois, Quin Blanding, Olamide Zaccheaus, Amhad Hawkins, Jake McGee and Luke Bowanko are registered. Pro baseball players Connor Jones and Riley Wilson are registered. As far as UVa men\u2019s basketball, Sean Singletary, London Perrantes, Isaiah Wilkins, Justin Anderson, Ty Jerome, Kyle Guy and De\u2019Andre Hunter are all on board. \u201cThis embodies a lot of what we want to do, which is have a platform for the players to express and control the narrative in terms of player empowerment, so this is something they want to do and they can control how they do it and they don\u2019t have to rely on anyone else,\u201d Huang said. \u201cThere\u2019s no middle man that\u2019s taking money and 100% of everything goes to charity.\u201d The idea, which Locker Room Access has posted on social media for a few days, has gained interest. Players from UVa programs showed interest by joining the tournament and in some cases agreeing to sign memorabilia. Outside of UVa, there was interest from other schools and former Golden State Warriors star Baron Davis, who liked the idea of doing something similar with the Warriors. Huang and Jerome know the video game tournament isn\u2019t a ground-breaking idea \u2014 the NBA played a tournament earlier in the month with Suns guard Devin Booker winning the event \u2014 but they hope doing this with former collegiate players could start a trend of giving on a smaller scale. \u201cThere are so many people who are in need right now, and we hope this catches on,\u201d Mark Jerome said. For a platform that wants UVa fans to have inside access to the people who make up the men\u2019s basketball program. Huang and Jerome believe a live-streamed 2K Tournament to benefit those in need is an ideal option during this unusual time. \u201cFirst of all, when you\u2019re playing games, you\u2019re staying inside and you\u2019re social distancing and if you\u2019re watching on Twitch you\u2019re obviously staying at home, staying busing and you\u2019re still in sports and supporting something you like,\u201d Huang said. \u201cIt feels like it just checks all the right boxes off.\u201d","357":"It\u2019s been a month and a half since collegiate sports ceased athletic activity due to COVID-19, and University of Virginia sports teams haven\u2019t taken the court or field since March 11. Fans lost out on Stephen Schoch strikeouts, Mamadi Diakite dunks and Matt Moore goals. The UVa women\u2019s lacrosse team lost a chance to contend for a Final Four, and the Virginia softball team\u2019s inaugural season in Palmer Park came to an abrupt and unsatisfactory end. Athletes, coaches and fans are left to watch reruns of old games or highlights as they follow the stay-at-home orders in place across much of the country. Instead of enjoying the warmer weather and attending sporting events in large groups \u2014 perhaps grabbing an alcoholic beverage at Disharoon Park \u2014 collegiate sports are on hold. Temporarily losing sports costs universities a massive revenue stream. It hurts fans, who lose a chance to watch their favorite players. It also hurts players who poured every ounce of themselves into preparing for their seasons. While there\u2019s plenty lost, the decision to halt sports brings with it public health benefits. Over the past six weeks, UVa players and coaches have seen that perspective clearly. \u201cIn the end, it\u2019s a baseball game,\u201d UVa baseball coach Brian O\u2019Connor said days after the season ended. \u201cIn the end, it\u2019s a sport. You need to take care of everybody first, and we\u2019ll see what the future holds for us.\u201d Virginia football coach Bronco Mendenhall acted swiftly as news came out about the severity of the spread of COVID-19. While the ACC men\u2019s basketball tournament was playing games on March 11 with fans in the stands, Mendenhall announced a temporary suspension of spring football activity. The report of Mendenhall\u2019s decision came from Richmond Times-Dispatch reporter Mike Barber over an hour before the NBA suspended its season. Mendenhall acted quickly as he learned about the potential impact of the virus. \u201cThis had the potential to be basically something that could affect the human family,\u201d Mendenhall said in mid-March. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t difficult for me to frame it in that regard, and so football became an afterthought at that point. Student-athlete and just basically human-being welfare became paramount.\u201d Mendenhall\u2019s decision was soon followed by the ACC Tournament\u2019s cancellation and the NCAA\u2019s announcements that all winter and spring championships were canceled. Those decisions came within a day of the news of Mendenhall\u2019s suspension of spring football activity. When sports do return at some point, the athletes expect a different level of enthusiasm and energy at practices. They\u2019ve seen that they can lose their seasons in a matter of hours, and many have gained a newfound appreciation for their sports. \u201cEven as crazy as it sounds, I would condition right now just to be with my guys because I miss them all so much,\u201d Schoch said. Kate Covington and the Virginia softball team picked up their first wins at Palmer Park two days before spring sports championships were canceled. The Cavaliers played just six of their 23 scheduled home games this season. Covington expects a newfound energy from her teammates and competitors across the college softball landscape when the sport returns. \u201cI think college softball as a whole next year is going to be a cool thing to watch,\u201d Covington said. \u201cI think there\u2019s going to be a lot of people with a lot of energy toward the game and just excitement to get out there.\u201d Losing sports takes away an escape from the stresses of everyday life. During a stressful time globally as the world battles a novel coronavirus, an escape would be nice. The decision to halt organized sports wasn\u2019t about losing an escape, however, it was meant to save lives. According to a statistical model designed in part by researchers at the UVa Biocomplexity Institute, current social distancing efforts are working in the commonwealth. These measures are designed to keep hospitals from becoming overwhelmed with an influx of patients. Social distancing measures are a sacrifice, and the sacrifice includes the postponement of collegiate athletics. The goal of those measures was and is to save lives. UVa athletes and coaches understood the value of losing their seasons. \u201cThe fact that we stopped, I understand that it might hurt us a little bit,\u201d Diakite said, \u201cbut it\u2019s something that we had to do in order to save a lot of people in the world.\u201d","358":"Members of the Washington Nationals joined a Zoom call on April 15 to watch the replay of Game 7 of the World Series. Among those on the call, which was streamed on Facebook Live, were former UVa standouts Sean Doolittle and Ryan Zimmerman. The call featured jokes about the Astros, reminiscing on clutch hits and plenty of laughs. The call also helped raise over $200,000 for Pros for Heroes, an organization founded by Zimmerman and his wife Heather. The organization provides protective equipment and meals to healthcare professionals helping treat COVID-19. \u201cThese critical-care professionals are the true heroes, and we believe supporting them in any manner is incredibly important,\u201d Zimmerman wrote in a statement. \u201cAs we start this Pros for Heroes fund, we are focusing on a multi-pronged approach keeping our first responders covered at work and comfortable at home.\u201d The Zimmermans donated $100,000 to the cause. The organization has raised over $300,000 since its launch on April 14. \u201cIt\u2019s off to a good start, and the other night was so much fun, kind of getting the word out about that and seeing all the guys again,\u201d Doolittle said. Doolittle says the Zoom call shed light into what it\u2019s really like to be a member of the Washington Nationals organization. The conversations during the game weren\u2019t filtered, as the players joked about the Astros\u2019 sign-stealing scandal and talked openly about the Game 7 plays that helped the team win the World Series title. For Doolittle, he found himself remembering moments he forgot about immediately after they happened. After Howie Kendrick\u2019s two-run homer in the seventh inning gave Washington a 3-2 lead, much of the rest of the game was a blur for the left-handed reliever. Watching the game back helped him remember Juan Soto\u2019s RBI single and the two-RBI base knock off the bat of Adam Eaton. \u201cI knew that we scored two more runs to make it 6-2, but like, I couldn\u2019t have told you how we did that,\u201d Doolittle said. \u201cLike, I really just forgot.\u201d One of Doolittle\u2019s memories was watching the game through Houston\u2019s out-of-town scoreboard to keep an eye on the game while finding a place to stay calm. He says the odd view may have been part of the reason why he forgot what exactly happened. \u201cI was trying to control my breath and not throw up, but apparently I missed some stuff,\u201d Doolittle laughed. Originally, the Zoom call was supposed to feature a few players stopping in for an inning or two to add insight. Zimmerman joined for the final few innings, but many players like Doolittle stayed on the call for most of the game. \u201cNobody wanted to leave, so we ended up just hanging out,\u201d Doolittle said. \u201cIt was awesome for us, for the players to see and talk to each other again, and I\u2019m glad fans got to see it because it was really like a genuine look into how we talk in the clubhouse and on the plane and when we\u2019re on the bus. That\u2019s how we really interact, and I love hanging out with those guys and that\u2019s one of things I miss most about playing.\u201d Both Doolittle and Zimmerman spent ample time on the call, sharing the moment with teammates. Winning the World Series was a special memory for both former Cavaliers. Reaching the pinnacle of the sport was one thing, but doing it with a former college teammate meant even more. Neither player advanced out of the NCAA Regionals when they were teammates at UVa, and they were both accustomed to quick postseason exits at the professional level. The 2019 season went much differently. After a slow start to the season, the Nationals hit their stride. They found ways to gut out close postseason victories, and ultimately, Washington hoisted the World Series trophy. \u201cIt\u2019s so cool, man, and that\u2019s one of the reasons why the World Series win was so special,\u201d Doolittle said. \u201cThere were so many storylines like that.\u201d Doolittle and Zimmerman went from college teammates to World Series champions. They\u2019ve lived out their professional dreams, with both of them finding a baseball home in Washington. Zimmerman is giving back to the place he calls home by helping those who keep his community healthy. A friendly Zoom call with the Nationals, including two prominent former UVa stars, helped the initiative get off to a fast start. \u201cHonestly, I don\u2019t think anyone will be able to recreate what we did that night,\u201d Zimmerman told reporters on a recent conference call. \u201cThat\u2019s been a huge part of why this has been so successful, so quick. Now it\u2019s our job to keep it going.\u201d","359":"The University of Virginia athletics department worked with Nike\u2019s Global Identity Group to update its branding. The work with Nike\u2019s GIG created an updated logo, two new secondary logos, an updated color scheme and new typography and numbers, which were revealed Friday. UVa\u2019s director of athletics, Carla Williams, said in a news release that the athletic department considered delaying the release of the new brand identity given the challenges people are facing due to COVID-19, but the department ultimately went ahead with it. She added that she hopes the new logos and brand identity can \u201cserve as a rallying point for our coaches, student-athletes, prospective student-athletes and fans.\u201d When it comes to the new logos and marks, Williams seems pleased with Nike\u2019s work. \u201cI love the new visual identity system,\u201d Williams said. \u201cIt\u2019s exciting and it maintains UVa\u2019s sense of history and a strong connection to the past. It pays homage to our tradition and what we hope our future will be, which is to be bold, creative, innovative, competitive, fierce and fiery. The new marks and logos have all of those qualities in each of them.\u201d According to the release, the update of the brand identity and logos came after 18 months of working with Nike. The company spoke with players, coaches and administrators to better understand the university and how a logo could best reflect the athletic department. The updates to the logos include a few changes aimed at making the V-Sabre mark more noticeable. \u201cThe V-Sabre logo is uniquely Virginia,\u201d Williams said. \u201cI noticed our logo sometimes gets washed out in comparison to the other logos in the [Atlantic Coast Conference]. Those logos have become more visually impressive over the years. The updates to the V-Sabre enhance our primary mark and enable it to be pronounced when it is positioned side-by-side with our competition.\u201d The Cavalier shield and Cavalier marks also were updated. Apparel with the new logos can be found at CavalierTeamShop.com, UVABookstores.com and Mincers.com.","360":null,"361":"The spread of COVID-19 brought with it the sudden end of the collegiate sports seasons. The NCAA Tournament was canceled and spring sports teams finished fewer than half of their games. A quick and unexpected ending to the season ended the collegiate careers of some athletes, including Virginia\u2019s Mamadi Diakite and Michael Kraus. Diakite plans on joining the NBA after graduation, while Kraus is passing on an additional year of eligibility relief to turn pro. With decisions like those from student-athletes and a shortened season for many sports also come a few interesting statistical nuggets. Had the seasons continued, Diakite and Kraus were among the individual UVa athletes poised to reach meaningful statistical milestones. \u00bb Diakite falls short of 1,000 career points Diakite finished his UVa career with 997 points. The forward scored 412 of those this season. With the ACC Tournament and NCAA Tournament left, Diakite was guaranteed at least two more games, assuming he avoided injury. The NBA prospect finished the season scoring at least 10 points in the final 12 games of the season. He ended the year averaging 13.7 points per contest. The fewest points Diakite scored in a game all season was four in a November win over UMass. If UVa played one more game, Diakite was very likely going to join the 1,000-point club. Instead, he fell just one 3-pointer shy of reaching the milestone. \u00bb Kraus misses bid to become Virginia\u2019s all-time leading goal scorer The men\u2019s lacrosse star finished his Virginia career with 131 goals, which ranks seventh on the school\u2019s all-time goal scoring list. Doug Knight, who ended his career with 165 goals, ranks first. Michael Watson is the only other UVa player to ever score 140 goals at UVa, and he scored 142. With eight games left in the regular season and 14 goals scored through six games, Kraus was very likely to become the third player in program history to score 140 goals in his career. If the Cavaliers made a deep run in both the ACC Tournament and NCAA Tournament, making it to the NCAA Championship, Kraus could have played 20 games. On his goal-scoring pace for the season, Kraus would\u2019ve ended a 20-game season with 47 goals. That would\u2019ve left him a goal short of Knight\u2019s 165 goals. Regardless, if the season played out and the Cavaliers went deep into the postseason, Kraus would\u2019ve made a run at the goal-scoring crown. \u00bb Kraus loses shot at becoming UVa\u2019s leader in points While Kraus would\u2019ve needed a lot of things to go his way to become the program\u2019s all-time leader in goals, he was well on his way to becoming No. 1 in career points. He ended his illustrious career with 240 points, thanks to 131 goals and 109 assists. He tallied 14 goals and 12 assists through six games this season. At that pace of 4.33 goals and assists per game, Kraus would\u2019ve finished the regular season with an additional 35 goals and assists, placing him just four points shy of Steele Stanwick\u2019s program record of 269 points. A postseason game or two likely would\u2019ve put Kraus over the top. \u00bb Max Cotier\u2019s three-base efforts stymied by early ending Admittedly, triples are quite tough to predict. Hitting triples doesn\u2019t usually follow a pattern like batting average or home runs do. They\u2019re harder to project. Recording triples requires a unique blend of contact, speed and power. Players need to put the ball in play into the outfield while also having enough speed to turn potential doubles into triples. Freshman Max Cotier had that for the UVa baseball team. Through 18 games, Cotier recorded an impressive four triples. With 38 games left on the regular-season schedule, Cotier was on pace to finish the year with 12 triples. Given the increase in talent among ACC pitchers and talent, recording eight more triples against the stiffest competition may seem a bit unreasonable, but the freshman did hit one of his four triples in the series finale against a ranked N.C. State squad. Derek Fisher and Jarrett Parker own the UVa single-season record with eight triples. Cotier was well on his way to that mark when the season ended. \u00bb Women\u2019s swimming and diving team loses national title shot The UVa women\u2019s swimming and diving program has never finished better than No. 5 in the NCAA Championships. The Cavaliers were ranked second when the season ended. The team was good enough to contend for a national title. Led by swimmer Paige Madden, UVa performed remarkably well at the ACC Championships, winning the event for the 16th time. This time, however, felt different. The Cavaliers set a meet record by tallying 1,492.5 points. This UVa team might\u2019ve been the most likely national champion of any of UVa\u2019s winter and spring sports.","362":"Hawaii, Texas Tech and Washington State throw the ball about as much as any college football team in the country. While Virginia doesn\u2019t post absurd passing statistics or remarkable touchdown numbers like those teams, under offensive coordinator Robert Anae, the Cavaliers love to pass. Last season, Virginia ran 961 offensive plays. Of those plays, 519 were pass plays, which accounts for 54% of all plays. The Cavaliers have thrown the ball at least 54% of the time in three of the past four seasons. Anae and head coach Bronco Mendenhall came to Charlottesville four seasons ago. With the departures of wide receivers Hasise Dubois and Joe Reed, UVa\u2019s offense could be due for a change in play calling next season. Add in a new era at quarterback with Bryce Perkins graduating and off to the NFL, and the Cavaliers may find themselves more reliant on their rushing attack solely out of necessity. Bringing in new receiving threats and a new quarterback makes the absence of spring practice due to COVID-19 even more challenging for UVa\u2019s developmental plan. \u201cWith the receivers coming in, guys leaving, guys stepping up and me stepping into the QB position, it would have been huge,\u201d Virginia quarterback Brennan Armstrong said. \u201cIt\u2019s different from like going out and throwing with the guys and actually getting live reps with the defense out there \u2026 it sucks, but we just gotta work with what we got and go forward.\u201d Despite new contributors, many of the players expected to accept larger roles come from within the program. Armstrong, the lead candidate to become the starting quarterback, is a redshirt sophomore. Terrell Jana, the top returning wide receiver, will be a senior. Tavares Kelly Jr. and Billy Kemp, both built like slot receivers, are juniors. At running back UVa added Ronnie Walker Jr., a rising junior, as a transfer from Indiana. The backfield also contains junior Wayne Taulapapa and sophomore Mike Hollins. There\u2019s experience within the program, even if many of the players are expected to take on larger roles. Experience is critical, but it doesn\u2019t completely erase the lack of recent offensive development. \u201cWell, there\u2019s nothing we\u2019ve done since the bowl game with a football with our players,\u201d Anae said. \u201cA quarterback pretty much does lots of things with the football. So have we been able to develop our quarterbacks since January? No, we haven\u2019t.\u201d Thanks to program experience and development, Anae knows what he\u2019s working with on offense. That\u2019s a major bonus, even without key developmental time. The offensive coordinator doesn\u2019t expect drastic scheme changes this season. \u201cNothing will be exactly the same from top to bottom, but I will say there are things that guys in the program have demonstrated a pretty good competency in so there will be things that look a little different next year,\u201d Anae said, \u201cbut we are not changing the offense from top to bottom differently.\u201d One benefit for the Cavaliers is their offensive line. Every offensive lineman listed on last year\u2019s two-deep for the Orange Bowl returns next season. The big men up front played their best football of the season at the end of last year. A group that struggled early in the season came into its own and played some of its best football of the year against teams like Virginia Tech, Clemson and Florida. A strong offensive line with a few good running backs make it possible that the Cavaliers could be closer to a 50-50 split when it comes to rushing and passing plays. \u201cWe have spent four years recruiting and developing our offensive line and going into this season, we\u2019re at the best spot in that regard,\u201d Anae said. \u201cOne with depth, so there\u2019s going to be competition for the guys up front, and No. 2, for the most part they now have a couple years of experience of doing what they\u2019re doing. I think with those two things the run game will have a bright prospect.\u201d Taulapapa led the Cavaliers running backs with 116 carries last season. The year prior, running back Jordan Ellis led the team with 215 carries. Perkins carried the ball 212 times. That season, UVa passed the ball just 41.8% of the time. With a mobile quarterback in Armstrong, three solid running backs and a proven offensive line, the road to success might come on the ground for UVa football in 2020.","363":"The Carolina Panthers have added former Virginia linebacker Jordan Mack as an undrafted free agent, according to multiple reports and UVa athletics. Mack becomes the fourth Virginia player in the 2020 draft class to either sign an undrafted free agent NFL contract or to be drafted in the 2020 NFL Draft. Mack joins Joe Reed, Bryce Hall and Bryce Perkins as the Cavaliers drafted or signed to undrafted free agent deals. Reed was drafted by the Los Angeles Chargers, while Hall went to the New York Jets. Perkins signed an undrafted free agent deal with the Los Angeles Rams. Reed provides the Chargers with versatility on offense and special teams. Hall brings the skills of a top coverage cornerback to the Jets. Perkins offers offensive versatility and athleticism to the Rams. Mack, on the other hand, brings a physical presence to a Carolina franchise looking to make a dramatic improvement on defense. The Panthers picked seven times in the NFL Draft. Every selection brought a defensive player to Carolina. While Mack wasn\u2019t picked in the NFL Draft, the hard-hitting linebacker will have a chance to compete for a roster spot as an undrafted free agent. During his time at UVa, Mack racked up 289 tackles and 14.5 sacks, including 7.5 sacks in his final collegiate season. An ankle injury, which is fully healed, may have hurt Mack\u2019s draft chances. Despite being invited to the NFL Combine, Mack was unable to participate due to his injury. He expected to participate in UVa\u2019s Pro Day, but it was canceled due to COVID-19. Given his production before the injury, Mack very well could have heard his named called in the NFL Draft if he remained healthy through his senior season and could have participated in the NFL Combine. Instead, he\u2019ll battle for a roster spot as an undrafted free agent on a Carolina team determined to improve its defense. He won\u2019t be the only undrafted former UVa player competing for a spot on Carolina\u2019s roster. Former Virginia safety Quin Blanding signed a reserve\/future contract with the Panthers in late December.","364":"Greensboro was set to host the men\u2019s basketball tournament this March \u2014 and it did host a few games \u2014 but COVID-19 canceled the event before it finished. Virginia never took the court for a 2020 ACC Tournament game. The Cavaliers were scheduled to face Notre Dame the day the tournament was canceled. \u201cThe partnership between the ACC and the city of Greensboro is extremely special, and one that has spanned nearly seven decades,\u201d ACC Commissioner John Swofford said in a release. \u201cThe decision to bring the ACC men\u2019s basketball tournament back to the Greensboro Coliseum was the right thing to do and we look forward to returning in 2023.\u201d The announcement gives the ACC locations for its next three conference tournaments. In 2021, the event will be held in Washington D.C. at Capital One Arena. In 2022, the event heads north to Brooklyn, New York, and the Barclays Center. UVa won the ACC Tournament in 2018, which was the last time the event was held in Brooklyn. The 2023 destination is now set with the event returning to Greensboro. Returning to Greensboro in 2023 felt like the best decision to Swofford, who wanted to make sure the proud basketball town earned another chance to host the event. Greensboro has hosted the event more than any other city, and it\u2019s a popular ACC Tournament destination among those not named Jim Boeheim. \u201cThat day when we had to cancel the remainder of the tournament going into the third day, my heart really bled for Greensboro as well as certainly those players and the fans and college basketball as a whole,\u201d Swofford said. Greensboro lost out on a few days of ACC Tournament action as well as opening NCAA Tournament rounds. The city not only lost chances to watch high-level collegiate basketball, it also lost the fans coming into the area to watch the games and boost local businesses. Canceling the ACC and NCAA Tournaments hurt Greensboro about as much as any location nationwide. \u201cI and the rest of our schools felt that it was really important to bring the tournament back to Greensboro as soon as we possibly could,\u201d Swofford said. \u201cThat first opportunity is 2023.\u201d","365":"The Virginia men\u2019s basketball team\u2019s postseason games were canceled. Spring sports, like UVa baseball, took an even bigger hit, losing the majority of their seasons due to restrictions brought about by COVID-19. Gone are late-spring and early-summer days at Disharoon Park, watching the Cavaliers compete for an ACC title with an ice-cold beverage in hand. While Brian O\u2019Connor\u2019s group is done for the season, that doesn\u2019t mean baseball is completely gone. The Korean Baseball Organization begins its season Tuesday after a month-long postponement, and the league features a UVa flair. Tyler Wilson, who pitched for Virginia from 2008-11, enters his third season as a member of the LG Twins. ESPN is reportedly negotiating for the rights to KBO games, meaning UVa fans might have a chance to watch Wilson. \u201cIt\u2019s not the MLB,\u201d Wilson said of the KBO. \u201cIt\u2019s very different than the MLB, but that doesn\u2019t make it any better or any worse, it just is different. If people come into it expecting it to be the big leagues, it\u2019s not going to be that at all, but it\u2019s just as enjoyable.\u201d There\u2019s a noticeable talent gap between the KBO and Major League Baseball, according to Wilson, who knows what it\u2019s like at both levels. Wilson spent a few years in the minor leagues and three seasons at the MLB level with the Baltimore Orioles before joining the KBO. Since his arrival, he\u2019s been one of the better pitchers in the KBO. He won 14 games a season ago while logging 185 innings and posting an ERA of 2.92. Through two KBO seasons, Wilson has a 2.99 ERA in 355 innings of work, and he\u2019s 23-11 with 42 quality starts in 56 game started. He\u2019s been a reliable starter. While the league isn\u2019t quite as competitive as the major leagues, it\u2019s still a professional league with quality players. In Wilson\u2019s eyes, however, it\u2019s the fans that set the 10-team league apart from other professional leagues. \u201cIt\u2019s electric,\u201d Wilson said of the game-day atmosphere. \u201cI\u2019ve never pitched in a World Series, but I pitched in a College World Series and some pretty significant big league games too, and it\u2019s like that every game. There will be games where we\u2019ll be losing 20-2 for an extreme example, and it\u2019s the bottom of the ninth, two outs, we make the last out and the fans are like, \u2018Oh, no, I can\u2019t believe we didn\u2019t score 18 there in the ninth.\u2019 I admire that. I appreciate that, but it just shows how committed they are.\u201d Wilson spoke glowingly of the fans, who sing a unique song for every batter to take the plate. While MLB players might have a walk-up song, it usually fades out quickly before the at-bat without much fanfare \u2014 unless it\u2019s the Washington Nationals singing \u201cBaby Shark\u201d for Gerardo Parra \u2014 but fans in the KBO sing a song for each player throughout each at-bat. A player of the game is named after each win during the 144-game season, and players go and stand on a small stage and address the crowd. Fans cheer as the player does an interview. Unfortunately for the KBO, the season is set to start without fans in the stands due to COVID-19 restrictions. Playing games with more eyes tuned into the league \u2014 whether it\u2019s from ESPN or general interest as the KBO will be one of the few professional leagues globally competing in the next few weeks \u2014 worries Wilson. He knows how critical fans are to the league\u2019s success and games without those supporters in the stands won\u2019t quite be the same. He threw an exhibition game recently without fans, and the experience was unusual. \u201cI can hear my spikes going into the dirt as I\u2019m walking around,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cI can hear the clicks in the clacks, and I can hear the coaches talking in the dugout. I can hear the broadcaster up in the booth, and it\u2019s just different.\u201d A batter stepping to the plate helped Wilson lock back into the game, but the experience still represents a drastic change compared to the usual fanfare at KBO games. In addition to competing in empty stadiums, players also have their temperatures taken when arriving at the stadium as a precaution. There are restrictions to keep media isolated from the players, with interviews taking place in a conference room with reporters on one side of the room and players toward the other. When Wilson returned to South Korea after about 12 days in the United States waiting to see when the season would begin, he was required to take a coronavirus test and quarantine for 14 days even without testing positive. The country has taken steps to reduce the spread of the virus, which has led to a steep decline in new cases. Wilson says precautions, such as games without fans, are still being taken, but public venues like malls, restaurants and subways are open. A former UVa standout, Wilson still considers the Charlottesville area home and hopes to one day return to Virginia full-time with his wife and twins. Given his connection to the U.S., Wilson keeps close tabs on the news in the United States. As his home country remains largely locked down and under numerous restrictions, South Korea is largely open with sports returning. \u201cIt\u2019s unique because I\u2019m so in tune to what\u2019s going on with my family and everything in Charlottesville and everything in my home country,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s my home, so to be tapped into that but then be able to walk out of my apartment and see life going on as normal, it\u2019s an emotional challenge.\u201d It\u2019s an unusual and challenging time in Charlottesville and across the globe. For UVa fans, Wilson\u2019s season provides some sporting relief during a time when Virginia sports remain on hold.","366":"Virginia baseball coach Brian O\u2019Connor asked Evan Duhon 30 minutes before the team bus left for Louisville if Duhon could join the team to fill in for a sick manager. The freshman manager excitedly said yes, grabbing clothes from his locker and preparing for the 2016 road trip. Duhon, who the team nicknamed Rusty, was tasked with working team video in the press box. \u201cThe press box in Louisville has the most voluptuous spread of snacks,\u201d Duhon, now a fifth-year manager, recalled. \u201cThey have the best spread of snacks. They\u2019ve got all this candy, all the chips. They had pizza there. They had soft drinks, unlimited.\u201d He reacted like any college freshman would when seeing a spread of free food and drinks. \u201cI went nuts,\u201d Duhon said. O\u2019Connor and company decided to play a prank on the new manager. When the team returned to Charlottesville, a few of the assistants and video personnel drafted up a fake bill from Louisville, asking to be reimbursed for Duhon\u2019s eating frenzy. \u201cIt [said] that I had eaten like 18 boxes of M&Ms, and the bill was for like $210,\u201d Duhon said. The coaches told Duhon that O\u2019Connor was fuming about the bill, wondering why his freshman manager ate so much of Louisville\u2019s food. They warned the first-year manager to avoid O\u2019Connor for a day or so before discussing the problem with the head coach. Visiting Louisville represented Duhon\u2019s first road trip with the team. He was in just his first season with the Cavaliers. While the program was fresh off a national title and O\u2019Connor was among the most prominent names in college baseball, Duhon was just a freshman manager learning the ropes. \u201cI didn\u2019t have my feet underneath me, so I mean, you can imagine, I\u2019m pretty concerned about this,\u201d Duhon said. He made up his mind he would tell O\u2019Connor after their next game. When UVa lost, Duhon stayed away and waited for a better moment. The next day, during practice, O\u2019Connor called Duhon over to discuss the bill. \u201cI\u2019m like, \u2018Oh, coach, I don\u2019t know, man,\u2019\u201d Duhon said. \u201c\u2018I\u2019m so sorry. However you want me to pay, if it\u2019s check or cash, I\u2019ll handle it tomorrow.\u2019\u201d O\u2019Connor asked Duhon if he noticed the date on the bill. Duhon hadn\u2019t. \u201cYeah, it was April 1,\u201d O\u2019Connor told Duhon. \u201cHappy April Fool\u2019s Day.\u201d Becoming a manager When Duhon went through his list of potential colleges to attend, he cared about two things: academics and baseball. \u201cI would tour a college and email the head coach,\u201d Duhon said. \u201cI would say like, \u2018I\u2019m a prospective student. I\u2019d love to be a student manager.\u2019 If the coach didn\u2019t email me back, I pretty much crossed that college off my list.\u201d Fortunately for Duhon, he received some replies, including one from O\u2019Connor. The two met and discussed being a manager. Duhon wanted to know the program better, and O\u2019Connor wanted to talk with the prospective manager. Ultimately, Duhon found himself committed to the blend of academics and baseball that Virginia offered. UVa gave Duhon a trial period of a couple weeks to determine if he was a good fit with the program on move-in weekend. It\u2019s a big time commitment, and both sides wanted to give it a shot before jumping all the way in. The match stuck. A long career Duhon made an impact over his five years with the Virginia program. The manager, who graduated in 2019 before pursuing a master\u2019s degree this year, worked tirelessly to become someone the coaches and players trusted. He served in an interesting position as a bridge between coaches and players. He\u2019s a college student with similar interests and experiences as the players, but he worked closely with the coaches and ultimately was trying to absorb as much knowledge as possible to one day become a coach. Bridging that divide is something Duhon took pride in during his time with the team. He liked being someone both players and coaches could turn to and trust when they needed to talk. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to find a young man with his level of commitment, trustworthiness and just the ability to be one of the guys,\u201d former UVa baseball pitching coach and current Radford head coach Karl Kuhn said. \u201cHe\u2019s always on the line. Is he with the coaching staff or with the players? As a coach you always worry about that, but you never worried about that with Rusty.\u201d Kuhn trusted Duhon and knew the manager could be counted on throughout his tenure. \u201cHe was always a confidant,\u201d Kuhn said. \u201cHe always had the program\u2019s best interest at heart.\u201d Despite taking the head coaching job at Radford, Kuhn worked with Duhon from 2016-19. He saw the manager on a frequent basis and saw him grow up in the program. He went from a wide-eyed manager worried about his food bill from Louisville to an experienced manager with an understanding of practice, preparation and game days at the collegiate level. \u201cHe\u2019s a wonderful young man,\u201d Kuhn said. \u201cA kid when we got him and he turned into a wonderful young man.\u201d Unfortunately for Duhon, his final season with the UVa baseball program came to an end abruptly. The Cavaliers\u2019 season ended before it really started, as they played just three ACC games before COVID-19 caused the end of spring sports. Usually, players and managers have time to brace for the end of the season. Postseason games often come with the title of \u201celimination game.\u201d Instead, Virginia\u2019s season ended with a win 4-3 win over UMass Lowell in front of hundreds of kids on Field Trip Day. Nobody on the team expected the end of the season, which made the ending all the more painful to digest. After the news came out about the season, the NCAA ultimately awarded eligibility relief to spring sports athletes. Of course, that doesn\u2019t apply to student managers like Duhon. His career was over. \u201cIt was really tough to process that just like that, in a blink of an eye, it was all over,\u201d Duhon said. Next steps While the ending lacked a smooth transition, Duhon spent four full seasons and part of a fifth with the program. He leaves UVa with a wealth of knowledge about how to lead a top-tier Division I baseball program. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m close with all those guys now,\u201d Duhon said of the staff. \u201cI would do anything for those guys, and I definitely feel comfortable now after spending five years with those guys.\u201d Duhon expects to stick at the collegiate level following his graduation, as he likes that players are often still learning life lessons. The results matter, but many of the players won\u2019t play professionally and the use the lessons learned on the diamond to guide them through the rest of their lives. It\u2019s uncertain what job Duhon will take in college baseball \u2014 he\u2019s currently monitoring openings and staying on top of the situation \u2014 but COVID-19 has altered the collegiate sports landscape. When will sports return? Will some teams at the lower levels of collegiate baseball fold due to the financial implications of shutting down schools and athletics? Monitoring the situation is a challenge, but Duhon is up for it. He\u2019s ready for whatever is next. Given Duhon\u2019s success and impact at UVa, those within the program feel the team that lands him next will be glad it did. \u201cHe\u2019s a great kid, and he\u2019s as much a part of Virginia baseball in the last five or six years as we are,\u201d Kuhn said.","367":"Klay Thompson, Joe Harris and Kyle Guy are three of the best shooters ever coached by Tony Bennett. Expecting Virginia signee Carson McCorkle to reach that level of shooting prowess might not be realistic, but the North Carolina native will arrive in Charlottesville with a reputation of being a sharpshooter. A popular YouTube highlight video of McCorkle dubs the shooter as \u201cUVa\u2019s next Kyle Guy.\u201d He hopes he can become the latest shooter under Bennett to blossom into an NBA player. \u201cI think Tony Bennett does the best job in the country at developing professional players,\u201d McCorkle said. \u201cI think the Duke\u2019s and Carolina\u2019s and Kentucky\u2019s get kids who are more just ready for the NBA, ready for pros and they\u2019re not doing as much of the developing. I think Coach Bennett can take guys and turn them into professional players better than anybody in the country, which is something that spoke to me.\u201d To eventually reach those goals, the incoming freshman needs to put in the work. He\u2019s excited to arrive in Charlottesville and begin working under the coaching staff to become a top-tier ACC talent. McCorkle\u2019s exact arrival date is unknown, given everything surrounding COVID-19, but he\u2019s eagerly awaiting his arrival on grounds. When he enters UVa\u2019s training and practice programs, he hopes to develop defensively while also building his body to be ready for Division I basketball. Despite being known as a shooter, McCorkle does more on the court than just shoot. He attacks the rim well and can score in numerous ways outside of shooting jumpers. Added muscle might only improve his presence at the rim. \u201cI think I\u2019m an underrated athlete,\u201d McCorkle said. \u201cI think I\u2019m more athletic around the rim than people realize, and part of that is I don\u2019t use it as much as I should, which is something I\u2019m still trying to work on.\u201d As McCorkle works on adding weight and developing his game, he\u2019ll have time before he\u2019s needed to fill a major role on Bennett\u2019s roster. The Wahoos return Tomas Woldetensae, Casey Morsell and Kody Stattmann at the shooting guard spot. All three players hold meaningful game experience. Woldetensae is the current sharpshooter of the group, but with Sam Hauser added into the mix and Jay Huff likely returning alongside point guard Kihei Clark, shooting should not be an issue for the Cavaliers. That gives McCorkle the time needed to grow into his game at the Division I level. Guy, for example, averaged 18.6 minutes in his first season before moving into a starting role later in his Virginia career. McCorkle should have similar time to work on his game. Currently, McCorkle is working his way back to 100% after a foot injury. He isn\u2019t playing pick-up basketball yet, but he\u2019s working his way back with a few workouts. He uses pain as his guide to determine what he can and can\u2019t do as he inches closer to being fully healthy. McCorkle was the first member of UVa\u2019s 2020 recruiting class, which is one of the best signed by Bennett, according to recruiting sites. The three-member freshman class also includes the addition of Rice transfer Trey Murphy III, who has two years of eligibility remaining and is expected to sit out the 2020-21 season as a redshirt. In terms of incoming freshmen, McCorkle joins star point guard and triple-double machine Reece Beekman as well as small forward Jabri Abdur-Rahim. Beekman spreads the floor and passes exceptionally well, while the other two find ways to score consistently. \u201cCarson\u2019s gonna bring some added shooting, stretch the floor,\u201d UVa associate head coach Jason Williford said, \u201cand Jabri, he does it all. He\u2019s a three-level scorer.\u201d UVa\u2019s recruiting class is the second-best group of the Bennett era, according to recruiting rankings, falling behind only the 2016 class of Guy, De\u2019Andre Hunter, Ty Jerome and Huff. The quartet helped Virginia win its first national championship. The 2020 class is far from a guarantee to bring a title to town, but the group brings with it exceptional talent and a willingness to work. McCorkle dreams of becoming a pro, but first, he wants to win in a Virginia uniform. \u201cI think that we all fit the Virginia basketball program very well, and we\u2019re all excited to get up there and we all want to win,\u201d McCorkle said. \u201cWe\u2019re not a bunch of selfish guys. We want to do what we can for the team to help us win.\u201d","368":"The Mississauga, Ontario native fit the draft eligibility requirement, having lived in Canada for at least seven years before turning 15. Brissett, a 6-foot-1 wide receiver with good speed and size, contributed sparingly to Virginia\u2019s offense in 2019. The graduate transfer from Richmond played in 12 of the Cavaliers\u2019 14 games, but he hauled in just two receptions for 18 yards the entire season. At Richmond, however, Brissett was one of the best receivers at the FCS level. He recorded 63 receptions for 896 yards and seven touchdowns in 2017, averaging 81.5 receiving yards per contest. That strong play carried through to his senior season with the Spiders. As a senior in 2018, Brissett hauled in 16 receptions for 299 yards and a touchdown, averaging 99.7 yards per game. Unfortunately for the wide receiver, he suffered an injury after three games and missed the rest of the season. He was on pace for a career year for the Spiders. Brissett received a medical hardship waiver from the NCAA, giving him another season of eligibility, which he used at Virginia. He joins a Toronto team that struggled in 2019, finishing the 18-game season with a 4-14 record. Adding an offensive weapon makes sense for Toronto. The Argonauts struggled to score last season, ranking eighth in points scored in the nine-team league. With COVID-19 affecting Canada, the CFL won\u2019t start play until the beginning of July at the earliest. The league did say in a press release that it\u2019s committed to playing a season in 2020.","369":"All 20 University of Virginia head coaches, athletics director Carla Williams and 51 assistant coaches and staff members have taken voluntary salary reductions for the remainder of the calendar year, the school announced Friday. \u201cThe shared sacrifices of our coaches and staff will help us address financial shortfalls during this difficult time,\u201d Williams said. \u201cOur hearts go out to those who are suffering and to those who have lost loved ones.\u201d An athletic department spokesperson confirmed a report by The Daily Press that the salary reductions are either 5% or 10%, depending on the individual\u2019s salary level. According to a press release, UVa staff members were asked to participate in the salary reductions in mid-April, and the reductions took place starting with the current pay period. Given the uncertain circumstances in the sporting world due to COVID-19, UVa hasn\u2019t competed in an athletic event since March 11. There\u2019s no time frame for when athletic activity across the ACC or at Virginia will resume. UVa has also yet to announce plans for how it will handle the 2020 fall semester. With that announcement will likely come more news about how the school will handle the next few months of athletic activity. The announcement about athletic salary reductions comes two and a half weeks after UVa announced hiring and salary freezes for its employees aimed to lessen the financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. UVa\u2019s executive leadership team took salary reductions of 10% at that time.","370":"While the Cavaliers still aren\u2019t practicing due to COVID-19, they added graduate transfer Keytaon Thompson from Mississippi State on Friday. Thompson will be immediately eligible for UVa with two years of eligibility remaining. He\u2019ll likely compete with returning quarterback Brennan Armstrong for the starting quarterback position. \u201cKeytaon is big, physical, fast, dynamic. An exceptional athlete,\u201d Virginia football coach Bronco Mendenhall said in a video posted by the program\u2019s official Twitter account. \u201cTo win the Coastal Division and the ACC championship, two quarterbacks are always necessary, not just one. So in addition to Brennan Armstrong, who we already love, we get the chance to welcome Keytaon Thompson to our program. That just increases our chances to have the season we are all hoping for.\u201d At Mississippi State, the former four-star recruit played sparingly in recent seasons. In 2019, Thompson didn\u2019t throw a pass or carry the football, but he did bring in one reception for eight yards. Thompson saw most of his action in 2017 in relief on Mississippi State\u2019s injured starting quarterback. He rushed the ball 75 times for 446 yards and six touchdowns, while also throwing the ball 66 times for 388 yards and two touchdowns. He only completed 32 of his 66 passes, however, and threw a pair of interceptions. In 2018, Thompson completed 18 of his 39 passes for 458 yards, six touchdowns and one interception. He rushed for an additional 226 yards. With a 6.8 yards per carry average and 10 touchdowns on 99 rushing attempts, it\u2019s clear Thompson is dynamic running with the football. Even if Armstrong wins the starting job, it wouldn\u2019t be surprising to see a running package for Thompson developed. As a passer, Thompson needs some development. A career completion percentage of 48% on 105 passes leaves plenty to be desired. He did, however, throw eight touchdowns to his three career interceptions as a Bulldog. He also possesses a strong arm and can make throws across the field. Practice remains stopped, but when football activity resumes, Armstrong and Thompson will duel it out for the starting quarterback job.","371":"Well, you know what they say about assumptions. UVa has added graduate transfer Keytaon Thompson to its roster, the program announced Friday. Thompson comes to Charlottesville from Mississippi State with two years of eligibility remaining, and he\u2019ll be eligible to compete immediately. Hello, quarterback competition. Thompson is a tall, athletic, dual-threat quarterback with decent experience at the Power 5 level. He\u2019s worthy of a starting role, and he\u2019s played more collegiate snaps than Armstrong. In Armstrong\u2019s UVa career, he\u2019s thrown 25 passes and ran the ball 16 times. In three years at Mississippi State, Thompson threw the ball 105 times and tallied 99 rushing attempts. He found the end zone 10 times as a rusher while tossing eight touchdowns through the air. Armstrong played more than Thompson in 2019, though. UVa\u2019s left-handed backup threw the ball 20 times last season while running seven times. Thompson didn\u2019t throw a pass or run the football, but did make one reception for eight yards. Despite each player taking the field over the past few seasons, both quarterbacks lack recent meaningful game experience, leaving UVa with uncertainty moving forward. Armstrong and Thompson can both make plays with their arm and legs, while Thompson is a bigger player with more dynamic ability as a rusher. At 6-foot-4 and 225 pounds, Thompson is built more like Perkins than Armstrong. On the other hand, Armstrong knows the offense well, given his years at UVa, and he\u2019s a good passer with solid field awareness. He\u2019s also a shifty runner. \u201cHe\u2019s just one of those players who under duress seems to have the game slow down rather than speed up for him,\u201d Virginia coach Bronco Mendenhall said on a media teleconference in March. \u201cIf you have a choice, that\u2019s where you\u2019d like players to excel.\u201d Each quarterback has strengths that could lead to them becoming the starter. For Armstrong, leadership and familiarity with the offensive system jump out. \u201cHe\u2019s shown great leadership qualities thus far,\u201d linebacker Charles Snowden said of Armstrong during a media teleconference call in April. \u201cThe meetings we\u2019ve had he\u2019s always the first one up there. He\u2019s not an overly vocal guy but he talks when he needs to. The guys respect him and I think he\u2019s a good football player and I think he\u2019ll be able to lead this team.\u201d Instead of spring practice, summer workouts and eventually fall football, COVID-19 leaves collegiate athletic programs left to wonder what\u2019s next. For UVa, it\u2019s clear a competition for the starting quarterback job is on its way. It\u2019s just unclear when the competition will begin. Thompson is expected to enroll at Virginia in the summer. As of early May, there\u2019s uncertainty on how UVa\u2019s fall semester and fall athletic activity will function. Currently, most players are at their homes across the country communicating with coaches via Zoom and finding ways to creatively exercise to stay fit. Video calls with coaches and teammates are one thing when it comes to learning the playbook and interacting with others, but Thompson\u2019s arrival on grounds will play an important role in his eventual development. Understandably, he\u2019ll need actual reps with receivers to develop a connection on the field. In-person interaction with teammates also will help Thompson as he aims to slide into a leadership role. Transferring into a program with the alterations caused by COVID-19 is a challenge, but as Perkins showed in his two years at Virginia, a transfer quarterback can come into the UVa program and find success both as a leader and a player. Thompson\u2019s addition doesn\u2019t mean he becomes the unquestioned starter. It doesn\u2019t mean he will ever become the starter. The arrival of another quarterback means the Cavaliers add a dynamic athlete to a quarterback room in need of depth. Thompson adds a running threat and the Cavaliers could create a package for Thompson to come in as a run-first option at quarterback if he doesn\u2019t win the starting job. At the very least, Thompson brings dual-threat ability to an inexperienced position group in need of a talented veteran. Mendenhall wants his players to earn accomplishments. With Thompson joining the group, UVa\u2019s starting quarterback role in 2020 will be earned, not given. Whoever earns the job has big shoes to fill. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything he can\u2019t do,\u201d Mendenhall said of Bryce Perkins after the Cavaliers beat Virginia Tech in November. \u201cThere\u2019s not a play he can\u2019t make. I think Bryce Perkins changes the face of UVa football.\u201d No pressure.","372":"Collegiate sports came to an abrupt end this season. The spread of the novel coronavirus caused the NCAA and conferences to take drastic action by canceling spring sporting activities. Without March Madness, the men\u2019s or women\u2019s College World Series and any lacrosse postseason play, numerous opportunities to create memorable moments were flushed away. Despite a short spring season, Virginia\u2019s athletic programs still made big impacts during the 2019-20 academic year. From the football team finally winning the Commonwealth Cup to the field hockey team punching a ticket to the Final Four, there was no shortage of memorable sports moments in Charlottesville during the past collegiate sports season. Here\u2019s a look at the 10 most memorable moments from the season. 10. Women\u2019s basketball erases a 22-point deficit to beat Miami Tina Thompson\u2019s team found itself down 22 points in the first half of a Feb. 13 home game against Miami. The Hurricanes were connecting from beyond the arc, and UVa\u2019s offense looked out of sorts. The Cavaliers were on the verge of getting blown out. But in the second half, Virginia\u2019s defensive intensity picked up tremendously. The Cavaliers trailed 42-24 at halftime, but they outscored the Hurricanes 45-22 in the final 20 minutes to win the game, 69-64. Jocelyn Willoughby scored 25 to lead UVa. \u201cI\u2019m really, really proud of our kids and their fight tonight, especially in the second half coming back and keeping their composure,\u201d Thompson said after the game. \u201cI am even more excited that I was able to use my post-game speech Part B and not part A, because part A was not PG-13.\u201d 9. Men\u2019s lacrosse opens the season as the No. 1 team Fresh off a national championship, the Cavaliers opened the season at No. 1 and boasted a loaded roster featuring the likes of Dox Aitken and Matt Moore. While the season didn\u2019t go quite as the Cavaliers hoped \u2014 they went 4-2 before the season was canceled \u2014 they still looked the part of a national championship contender. Opening the season at No. 1 reflected UVa\u2019s talent level and its accomplishments from the prior season. 8. Both men\u2019s and women\u2019s soccer appear simultaneously at No. 1 in the polls The UVa women\u2019s soccer team saw its season cut short with an upset loss to Washington State in the NCAA Tournament. Men\u2019s soccer lost a heartbreaker to Georgetown in the national championship game. Prior to those defeats, both programs ascended to No. 1 nationally during the regular season. Led by senior Meghan McCool and freshman Diana Ordonez, UVa women\u2019s soccer became one of the best programs in the nation. The men\u2019s program leaned on stellar team defense and Daryl Dike on the attack as well as Joe Bell\u2019s play as a midfielder to rank No. 1 for a portion of the season. 7. UVa men\u2019s basketball ends the year on an eight-game winning streak The Cavaliers were winning games by the narrowest of margins at the end of the season, but they were winning. They earned the No. 2 seed heading into the ACC Tournament before the event was canceled due to COVID-19. After a 4-4 start to ACC play, Virginia went 11-1 to finish 15-5 in the league. The Wahoos found ways to win close games, and they were trending upward heading into the NCAA Tournament. Familiar faces like Kihei Clark and Jay Huff were playing the best basketball of their collegiate careers down the stretch. 6. Women\u2019s swimming and diving wins 16th ACC title The Virginia women\u2019s swimming and diving program tends to dominate ACC action, but this year\u2019s group was exceptionally good. The Cavaliers won the ACC title before their season ended abruptly before the NCAA Championships. \u201cI told them that I believed this was the best team in the history of the University of Virginia,\u201d head coach Todd DeSorbo said after the meet. \u201cThe goal here at ACCs was to score more points than this team has ever scored. Day-to-day, event-to-event, we set out to do that, and they accomplished that.\u201d 5. Softball opens Palmer Park The UVa softball program has struggled in recent seasons, and the Cavaliers\u2019 stadium was outside the main UVa sports bubble. That changed with the opening of Palmer Park. The brand-new facility brings the program to the same level or above its ACC peers in terms of facilities. Logistically, the facility allows players to practice and lift and receive treatment without having to drive to different spots in the Charlottesville area. Palmer Park acts as a central location for a program hoping to take a leap forward in future seasons. The Cavaliers went 2-4 in the facility, including wins in its last two games, before the season\u2019s end. 4. Field hockey makes the Final Four A goal from Annie McDonough in overtime gave the UVa field hockey team a spot in the Final Four. The Cavaliers hosted Maryland on a chilly November afternoon, and survived the game with a 1-0 victory on McDonough\u2019s goal. \u201cIt\u2019s like the best day of my life,\u201d McDonough said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t have asked for anything else. It was amazing.\u201d It was a special season for the Wahoos, who made the Final Four for the first time since 2010. 3. Men\u2019s soccer makes the national title game The UVa men\u2019s soccer team\u2019s path to the national championship game was exhilarating. The Cavaliers cruised by Campbell and St. John\u2019s in the first two rounds before having to gut out a 3-2 overtime victory over SMU in the Elite Eight. Both teams performed like Final Four caliber teams. Ultimately, UVa prevailed and made the College Cup. Virginia defeated Wake Forest 2-1 to clinch a spot in the championship, before falling to Georgetown 7-6 in penalty kicks after a thrilling bout between the teams. The teams played to a 3-3 draw in regulation and overtime before the penalty kick shootout. 2. The events of Sept. 13 and 14 Friday night featured UVa\u2019s \u201cA Night with the National Champions\u201d event. The event at John Paul Jones Arena gave fans a chance to hear players and Tony Bennett discuss the national championship victory. It also served as the official banner raising ceremony. The next day, the Virginia football team beat Florida State 31-24 in a game that ended with UVa fans rushing the field. The Cavaliers came back with a strong fourth quarter to win and cap off an exceptional weekend. 1. Football beats Virginia Tech It likely would have taken a national championship by a spring or winter sports program to unseat this memory from the No. 1 spot. After 15 long years of losing to the Hokies, UVa finally broke through in a thrilling Black Friday game. Bryce Perkins put the offensive load on his shoulders, finishing with 475 total yards and three touchdowns. He shined and battered defense missing a handful of starters rallied late in the game to help Virginia win the Commonwealth Clash by a final score of 39-30. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything he can\u2019t do,\u201d Virginia coach Bronco Mendenhall said. \u201cThere\u2019s not a play he can\u2019t make. I think Bryce Perkins changes the face of UVa football. This era certainly doesn\u2019t happen without Bryce at quarterback.\u201d The win finally came for UVa fans, and it propelled the Cavaliers into the ACC Championship Game and eventually the Orange Bowl.","373":"Kyle Teel could have entered the upcoming MLB Draft. Even with a potentially shortened draft, Teel is regarded by outlets such as Prep Baseball Report and Baseball America as a top-100 prospect. Instead, the star catcher is sticking to his plan to play baseball at UVa. He\u2019ll join head coach Brian O\u2019Connor and the Cavaliers in the fall, pushing his eligibility for the draft back to 2023. \u201cI let Coach O\u2019Connor and [Assistant] Coach [Kevin] McMullan know that I was going to be 100% committing myself to Virginia, and I\u2019m going to be forgoing the draft and then I sent out a letter to all the [MLB] teams that I\u2019m forgoing the draft,\u201d Teel said. Teel\u2019s decision came with academics and athletics in mind. Playing in the majors is a goal of Teel\u2019s but he also knows challenges come with making the big leagues. \u201cI spoke with my family about the pros and cons of both going to UVa, going to professional baseball, and we figured it\u2019s best to go to UVa because we know it\u2019s a top public university and an education would help me develop further in not only baseball but in life,\u201d Teel said. \u201cVirginia would do a really great job of setting me up for my future in baseball and life.\u201d Signing Teel gives UVa an elite prospect at catcher who plans to arrive on grounds in the fall, assuming classes operate in person. Teel, a New Jersey native, bats left-handed but throws right-handed. His combination of hitting and defense behind the plate entices MLB scouts. He\u2019s an athletic prospect with good arm strength and mobility as a defender. With high school baseball across Teel\u2019s home state of New Jersey impacted by COVID-19 and stay-at-home orders, the incoming freshman makes use of a family baseball facility to keep his game sharp. Teel\u2019s father owns a baseball training facility in the area, and the prospect uses that to stay in shape and work on his game while practicing social distancing. \u201cWhat\u2019s big with me right now is the weight room, just getting in the weight room every day, developing physically, and I think that will have a big impact on my game,\u201d Teel said. Teel\u2019s brother, Aidan, is a high school pitcher verbally committed to UVa in the class of 2023. Having a pitcher in the house is certainly a convenient relationship for the catcher. He knows missing games is a challenge, but most players across the country find themselves in the same situation, so he\u2019s doing all he can to stay ready for his collegiate career. On Teel\u2019s visit to UVa, he watched a preview of \u201c1186 to Omaha: UVa baseball\u2019s road to the national title\u201d and said the documentary outlining Virginia\u2019s 2015 national championship sparked a fire within him to win a College World Series. He already knew he wanted to reach the pinnacle of the college baseball world, but seeing the documentary took his desire to succeed at the collegiate level to a higher mark. He says when he goes through workouts or drills, the goal of winning a national championship creeps into his mind. While entering the MLB Draft was a distinct possibility for Teel, he wants a chance to chase a national title. He joins a growing list of MLB talents to forgo the draft and opt to join O\u2019Connor at Virginia. Freshman pitcher Nate Savino was a top prospect but decided to come to UVa this season. Fellow freshman Chris Newell, who played centerfield in 2020, also had MLB potential coming out of high school. They both decided to attend UVa instead. Add Teel\u2019s name to the list of talented prospects opting to spend a few years at UVa before trying to turn professional. \u201cMy first dream is to win a national championship at Virginia,\u201d Teel said, \u201cand my second dream is to be a big leaguer.\u201d","374":"For the first time in more than 50 years, there will be a summer with no Jefferson Swim League meets in Central Virginia. The JSL, which was established in 1966, voted Sunday night to cancel dual meets for the 2020 summer season The Executive Committee discussed at length the feasibility of holding a full or partial season this summer. They reviewed the recommendations set forth from USA Swimming and The Centers for Disease Control. \u201cThe JSL Board voted to cancel the JSL dual-meet season, in any form, for 2020,\u201d the release stated. \u201cNo dual meets will be sanctioned by the JSL in 2020. We sincerely hope that everyone understands and appreciates the difficulty of the decision to cancel the JSL season for the first time since the league began.\u201d In addition, the JSL treasury presented a financial document detailing the expenses of holding a partial season. A representative for every team in the JSL took part in the meeting and weighed in on the decision. The JSL Board said its top priority was ensuring the health and safety of all swimmers, officials and parents who take part in the 48 dual meets that were scheduled for this summer. \u201cDecisions like this are never easy,\u201d JSL president Chuck Fix said in a statement. \u201cThe effects of COVID-19 virus have impacted everyone, including the Jefferson Swim League. In the end, it came down to what was best for our swimmers, parents and volunteers.\u201d The decision comes as no surprise. At last month\u2019s board meeting, the JSL Board voted unanimously to cancel the championship, in any form, for 2020 and no version of a championship meet will be he held this summer, ending a run of 54 straight years of the event. This year\u2019s JSL championships were slated for July 24-25 at UVa\u2019s Aquatic and Fitness Center. A key factor in the decision was that UVa has banned group activities in its facilities through June 30 as part of Gov. Ralph Northam\u2019s \u201cstay at home\u201d executive order. The JSL Board noted that this decision only affects dual meets sanctioned by the League. That being said, the Executive Committee encouraged said it is \u201cparamount\u201d for all teams to strictly follow various coaching certification, CDC and USA Swimming guidelines to ensure the health and safety of the swimmers and other participants. \u201cWe hope that everyone will understand the difficulty of this decision,\u201d the release stated. \u201cWe wish that all families remain healthy and active this summer and look forward to a successful 2021 season.\u201d","375":"Two former Virginia men\u2019s lacrosse players heard their named called in the Major League Lacrosse Draft on Monday night. Senior attackman Michael Kraus was chosen by the Connecticut Hammerheads with the No. 2 overall pick in the draft, while midfielder Justin Schwenk was taken by the Philadelphia Barrage with the 39th overall pick. Kraus, a New Canaan, Connecticut native, is the first selection in the history of the Connecticut Hammerheads franchise, which is slated play its inaugural MLL season in 2020. Kraus became the 21st UVa Virginia player to be taken in the first round of the MLL Draft, which is tied with Syracuse for the most in history. Kraus, who had 14 goals and 12 assists in six games this past season prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, had the option to return for another season at Virginia after the NCAA granted eligibility relief for spring sports athletes, but chose to turn professional. Kraus tallied 240 points (131 goals, 109 assists) in his Virginia career, which ranks No. 4 in school history. He also is one of only four players in UVa history to record 100 goals and 100 assists in his career. Schwenk joined Kraus in the MLL ranks after being taken by the Barrage during the seventh round of the draft. Schwenk, who spent three seasons at Virginia after transferring from Monmouth, set the UVa single-season record for faceoff wins in 2018 with 242 and led the ACC with a 59.8 faceoff winning percentage. He joins a Barrage franchise that is returning to the MLL after folding following the 2008 season. Yale standout TD Ierlan was the No. 1 overall pick in the draft by the New York Lizards. New \u2018Hoos The Virginia women\u2019s soccer team has unveiled its 10-person recruiting class, which is ranked second nationally by Top Drawer Soccer. The class includes two players (defender Samar Guidry and forward Lia Godfrey) that are ranked in the top 10 nationally. The rest of the class includes Sarah Brunner, Maggie Fralin, Peyton Goldthwaite, Brianna Jablonowski, Elaine Rouse, Laughlin Ryan, Alexis Theoret and Purdue transfer Sarah Clark. \u201cThis class has tremendous potential to impact our program both in the short and long term, as there is a great blend of motivated, competitive, driven, thoughtful and talented athletes,\u201d Virginia coach Steve Swanson said. \u201cWe are looking forward to the day they can officially join our program and cannot wait to introduce them to our great fans in and around our soccer community in earnest this fall.\u201d The recruiting class will join a Virginia program that returns 21 players from last year\u2019s team that went 17-2-3 and reached the No.1 ranking in the country during the season. Academic honors Three Virginia wrestlers have been named Scholar All-Americans by the National Wrestling Coaches Association. Redshirt juniors Jay Aiello and Louie Hayes and redshirt freshman Justin McCoy were part of a group of 183 wrestlers from 66 different schools to earn the distinction. Aiello, who won the ACC championship at 197 pounds this past season, is completing a degree in economics. Hayes, who also was named a Scholar All-American following the 2018 season, is completing a degree in media studies and has been accepted to a masters program in the McIntire School of Commerce. McCoy is working toward a degree in kinesiology.","376":"The Virginia football team held each of its regular-season opponents to 35 or fewer points last season. Four of the team\u2019s first six foes failed to score 20 points. For the first half of the season, Bronco Mendenhall\u2019s group won with defense. As injuries mounted and opposing offenses improved, Virginia\u2019s defense became a liability. In the final two games of the season, Clemson and Florida combined to score 98 points on UVa. The Tigers amassed 62 points and 619 yards, while the Gators turned 549 yards into 36 points. \u201cWe have a bad taste in our mouth right now,\u201d co-defensive coordinator Nick Howell said. Against top-tier teams in the second half of the season, Virginia\u2019s defense struggled. North Carolina and freshman quarterback Sam Howell posted 539 yards of offense en route to 31 points against the Cavaliers. Virginia won the game thanks to offensive firepower of its own. Three games later, Virginia Tech racked up 483 yards of total offense and scored 30 points in a loss to the Cavaliers. Georgia Tech and Liberty scored 28 and 27 points, respectively, in the two previous games. After allowing 27 points or more just once in the first seven games, Virginia allowed at least 27 points in each of the last seven games of the 2019 season. \u201cWe\u2019re going like crazy right now and using that as motivation to fix that,\u201d Howell said, \u201cand there\u2019ll be some tests early in the season with Georgia right there and Clemson and North Carolina all those guys early in the schedule.\u201d Assuming the 2020 season starts on time and games go on as planned, UVa faces three high-powered offenses in the first five games of the season. Clemson, UNC and Georgia all ranked in the top 50 nationally in scoring offense a season ago. Fortunately for the Cavaliers, they return a formidable defense whenever the season eventually starts up. On the defensive line, they return Mandy Alonso, Jowon Briggs, Richard Burney and Aaron Faumui. At linebacker, Charles Snowden headlines a talented group that includes Noah Taylor, Zane Zandier and Nick Jackson, among others. The secondary returns Joey Blount, Brenton Nelson and De\u2019Vante Cross as well as other major contributors. Virginia\u2019s defense struggled at the end of last season, but the unit will likely be one of the ACC\u2019s strongest in 2020. \u201cReturning eight starters is phenomenal,\u201d Snowden said. \u201cIn the linebacker room alone, we have six guys with starting experience. That internal competition will be really good for us. And then I just think a lot of the guys \u2014 I know my class, kind of going into our senior year, me, Joey, Zane, Mandy \u2014 we\u2019ll have a lot to prove and we\u2019re really ready to take the next step, like we did last year.\u201d Snowden wants the Cavaliers to have a top-25 defense nationally. A season ago, the Cavaliers ranked 62nd nationally in scoring defense and 48th in total defense. Returning experience helps the Cavaliers\u2019 chances of becoming a top-25 defense, but the Cavaliers lose three critical defensive starters. Eli Hanback was an anchor in the middle of the defensive line, and he could also move to defensive end when needed. Jordan Mack provided tremendous help at linebacker. Bryce Hall was one of the nation\u2019s top corners before suffering a season-ending injury against Miami. \u201cI think it\u2019s kind of like the thing we had two years ago where we kind of said, well, we\u2019re only losing Juan [Thornhill], Tim [Harris] and Chris Peace but those were three of our best players,\u201d Snowden said. \u201cSo, again this year, we\u2019re just losing Eli, Bryce and J-Mack but again, three of our best players, two of them were captains.\u201d Losing three critical pieces hurts, but the Cavaliers hold the firepower at each position group to make up for the lost pieces. None of those graduated players can be replaced by an individual, but each position group\u2019s total talent and experience levels might surpass last season\u2019s starting squad, especially with players like Rob Snyder and Darrius Bratton poised to return from injuries. An experienced defense also helps a program handle football during the time of COVID-19. With spring practice gone, it\u2019s unclear when college teams will take the practice field to prepare for games. When UVa and other teams do return to practice, it shouldn\u2019t take long for the defense to find its rhythm and fly around the field given the chemistry among the returning contributors. \u201cI think one thing that benefits us with this experience too, if handled correctly, I think we can use that to an advantage defensively,\u201d Howell said. \u201cGuys know our scheme, and we should be able to go fast once we get back together.\u201d","377":"The Virginia football team continued its recent run of commitments on Thursday with the pledge of Georgia lineman Hugh Laughlin. Laughlin, who plays for Athens Academy in Athens, Georgia, announced his commitment to the Cavaliers in a Twitter post. \u201cThank you Coach [Clint] Sintim and Coach [Bronco] Mendenhall for giving me the opportunity to be a Cavalier,\u201d Laughlin wrote. The 6-foot-6, 285-pound Laughlin is listed as an offensive lineman by recruiting web sites but is expected to play on the defensive line for the Cavaliers. He is rated as a 3-star prospect by both 247 sports and Rivals and chose Virginia over offers from numerous Power 5 programs, including Florida State, Arizona State, Tennessee, Louisville, Boston College, Georgia Tech and Ole Miss, according to 247 sports. Laughlin becomes the 12th member of Virginia\u2019s 2021 recruiting class and the second from the state of Georgia, joining running back Amaad Foston, who is from Milledgeville, Georgia. Hoops matchup set On Thursday, the Virginia men\u2019s basketball team officially announced that it will face Villanova at Madison Square Garden this upcoming season. The announcement came a day after college basketball reporter Jon Rothstein reported that the neutral-site matchup between the Cavaliers and Wildcats would be happening. The game will take place on Saturday, Dec. 19 at noon and be televised nationally by Fox. \u201cWe have great respect for Coach Jay Wright and his program, and look forward to playing the Wildcats in a terrific environment,\u201d Virginia coach Tony Bennett said in a release announcing the matchup. Virginia and Villanova have combined to win three of the past four national championships and both teams are expected to be top 10 teams next season. \u201cWe are thrilled that two of the top college basketball programs in America are squaring off at Madison Square Garden this winter,\u201d said Joel Fisher, executive vice president, MSG Marquee Events\/Operations. \u201cVillanova and Virginia have won three of the last four NCAA Men\u2019s Basketball Championships, so this will be a treat for New York area fans and a highlight of The Garden\u2019s college basketball schedule next season.\u201d New ticket program The Virginia athletics department unveiled its \u201cFans First\u201d ticket program for the 2020-21 athletic year on Thursday. Among the program highlights are built-in tickets protections in case games are canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. If an event is canceled, fans who purchased tickets from the Virginia Athletics Ticket Office can get a refund or credit toward a future tickets and parking. Fans also will have the option to donate the ticket refund to the school\u2019s operational budget or athletics facilities master plan. UVa also announced custom payment plans for football season ticket purchases and extended the priority ordering deadline for football season tickets and parking until Friday, June 5. The school is moving to digital printing and delivery for its athletic tickets next season as well.","378":"Monica Wright Rogers joined the Virginia women\u2019s basketball coaching staff in May of 2019. When the former Cavalier star greeted Jocelyn Willoughby ahead of the 2019-20 season, she had a message for UVa\u2019s latest star. \u201cThe very first day she met me she was like, \u2018You\u2019re gonna be a draft pick,\u201d Willoughby said, \u201cwe need to start working on this.\u201d Wright\u2019s words turned into reality months later, when Willoughby heard her name called as the No. 10 overall pick in the 2020 WNBA Draft. She became the first UVa player drafted since Wright went second overall in 2010. Wright knew Willoughby possessed the talent to become a WNBA draft pick when she took the assistant coaching job. The new coach just needed to know from Day 1 that Willoughby was willing to put in the work to become a more consistent, confident player. Wright needed to know Willoughby held a desire to play in the WNBA. \u201cFirst, I needed to hear from her that she wanted it,\u201d Wright said, \u201cand she did. She told me flat out it\u2019s what she wanted, and I saw her ability, but you can have the ability and not want it. She had both.\u201d Once Wright knew UVa\u2019s top scorer wanted to make it in the WNBA, the coach and player went to work. Wright helped Willoughby study the game, showing Willoughby what the senior\u2019s strengths were while helping Willoughby improve the holes in her game. Under Wright\u2019s watch, Willoughby grew more confident in her game. She became the ACC\u2019s leading scorer at 19.2 points per game, and she snatched over seven rebounds per contest. Willoughby played within Virginia\u2019s system, but she also grew to understand that the Cavaliers needed her scoring to be at their best. She was the No. 1 option, and she needed to be. It was a season of consistent excellence for Willoughby. On April 17, that excellence paid off when she was selected in the WNBA Draft, giving UVa women\u2019s basketball its first draft pick in a decade. \u201cJust realizing that, not even being drafted, but just some of things I was able to accomplish at UVa hadn\u2019t happened until she was there,\u201d Willoughby said of Wright. \u201cIt was just really, really special to be able to share that with her back a part of the program because I know she put so much effort and energy into building it, and I was able to kind of carry that forward.\u201d To celebrate the moment amid restrictions caused by COVID-19, Willoughby held a Zoom call with former coaches and friends to practice social distancing while ensuring she didn\u2019t become a draft pick alone. One of those coaches on the call was an emotional Wright. \u201cShe\u2019s just like, \u2018I can\u2019t say too much right now because I don\u2019t want to start crying, but just so, so proud of you,\u2019\u201d Willoughby said. Wright wasn\u2019t thinking about her role in Willoughby become the first UVa draft pick since 2010. Instead, she was struck by all the people on the call to support Willoughby during an incredible individual accomplishment. Wright called the reaction of those on the call to Willoughby\u2019s selection \u201ca beautiful, beautiful moment.\u201d \u201cHer entire village was there to support her, and that\u2019s the part that really touched me, because Jocelyn has done a great job of making sure that she left a great legacy here, and people are just happy \u2013 genuinely happy \u2013 for her because they know who she is, which is a great young lady,\u201d Wright said. Willoughby was drafted by the Phoenix Mercury before being traded the same night to the New York Liberty. The WNBA season, local team tryouts, training camp and other events are all currently postponed due to COVID-19. Willoughby\u2019s pro career is temporarily on hold. When the season does begin, however, Willoughby adds another member to her village of supporters. \u201cI want to walk through this entire thing with her,\u201d Wright said. \u201cIt felt like when I went and got drafted I didn\u2019t really have that until later on in my pro career. I definitely want to be a sounding board for her as she walks through her pro career and just let her know that she has support and she has tons of people that want to help her and support her and be someone that she can lean on because it\u2019s not easy. The entire pro experience and being a pro is very hard, and you can\u2019t do it alone.\u201d Joining Wright in supporting Willoughby is Tina Thompson, UVa\u2019s head coach and the No. 1 overall pick in the 1997 WNBA Draft. Associate head coach Karleen Thompson, Tina Thompson\u2019s collegiate teammate, is a WNBA coaching veteran having spent time as a WNBA assistant coach, head coach and general manager. Between those three, the WNBA connections run deep on the UVa bench. \u201cTo have one of our babies drafted and be able to have that opportunity from this program is everything,\u201d Wright said.","379":"FREDERICKSBURG \u2014 After scholarship offers from major college programs began to trickle in for Aidan Ryan, the James Monroe junior football standout pinpointed the exact day he wanted to announce an oral commitment. Ryan initially chose Oct. 30 because it\u2019s his mother\u2019s birthday. But he soon realized six months would be too long for schools to wait and honor the offers they presented him in April. So Ryan sped up his timetable while maintaining his pledge to recognize Amy Ryan, who has been a single mother since his birth. Ryan announced his oral commitment to the University of Virginia on Sunday as a Mother\u2019s Day gift, complete with a Twitter video created by JM and University of Richmond alum Jarmal Bevels explaining the timing of his decision. \u201cFor the game that\u2019s been so important to me, I feel that it\u2019s only right that I make the biggest decision of my life on the day I want to honor my biggest fan \u2014 my mom,\u201d Ryan said on the video. \u201c\u2026 Our relationship is unbeatable.\u201d That bond has been nurtured from the beginning. Ryan has never met his father and has no relationship with any members of that side of his family. He has no brothers or sisters in his household. He said he and his mother are best friends. They go to the movies and dine out together. They have lighthearted conversations and serious talks about grades and worldly issues. During the extra time at home because of the COVID-19 pandemic, she\u2019s also taught him how to cook. Ryan said not having a father present or any siblings \u201ccreates the strongest bond I have with anybody\u201d between him and his mother. Amy Ryan has missed just one of her son\u2019s athletic events because she had surgery that day and still regrets not being there. Virginia was an attractive option for Ryan, a 6-foot-1, 193-pound safety prospect, in part because his mother and grandparents will be just 90 minutes away and have no trouble getting to home games. \u201cWe go through everything together \u2014 challenges and successes,\u201d Ryan said of his mother. \u201cIt just builds that strong relationship.\u201d A quick study Amy Ryan played volleyball and softball in high school in upstate New York. She moved to Fredericksburg in 1998 as a young adult when her family relocated for job reasons. Ryan was born five years later. Amy Ryan made youth sports a priority for her son. She signed Ryan up for basketball, soccer, tee-ball and baseball. He stopped playing soccer when he was 6 after the ball was booted squarely into his midsection. He first stepped onto a football field at age 7 in the Fredericksburg Parks and Recreation flag league. He began tackle football when he was 9. \u201cI loved football so much I just wanted to see how cute he would be in the pads and running around the field with a bunch of little kids,\u201d Amy Ryan said. \u201cBut very quickly he took to it. It became his favorite sport above anything else.\u201d Ryan\u2019s youth coaches recognized his special gifts. They had him play quarterback, receiver, defensive back and even center. Ryan played in the city\u2019s parks and rec league for five years before he moved on to the more intense American Youth Football travel league. He was a wide receiver, defensive back and part-time quarterback for the Fredericksburg Yellow Jackets. \u201cThe first time I picked up a football I instantly fell in love,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cSure it\u2019s just a game, but it\u2019s impacted my life in ways I never thought it would.\u201d Filling the void Amy Ryan said with the help of her parents and a host of coaches and mentors in the Fredericksburg area, her son has been shaped into a dynamic do-everything performer on the field and a well-adjusted youth in the classroom where he is an honor student. Whenever she was unable to transport him to practice or back home, someone always stepped in. \u201cAs far as the male influence in his life, I think that\u2019s part of the reason I put him into sports,\u201d Amy Ryan said, \u201cbecause every coach he\u2019s had has been amazing with him.\u201d When John Logan arrived at Walker\u2013Grant Middle School, he was a paraprofessional who would also serve as an assistant football and track and field coach and basketball volunteer. But when Logan first encountered Aidan Ryan, it wasn\u2019t during an athletic activity. It was Logan\u2019s first day on the job and Ryan was an eighth-grader who was already established on the Tigers\u2019 football team. \u201cI saw him in the hallway and the way he carried himself he was just really respectful,\u201d Logan said. \u201cHe was a kid that was about his books. I didn\u2019t know anybody and after the football games he and I would talk about life and from that first moment I knew he had his head on straight. So I was like, \u2018This is a guy I want to be able to help.\u2019\u201d Logan saw similarities in his and Ryan\u2019s upbringing. They both came from single-mother households. Logan grew up in Northern Virginia and was an all-state running back and safety at Annandale High. He went on to play running back for Norfolk State. He continues to serve as a trainer and mentor for Ryan. \u201cI know I didn\u2019t have that father figure role model in my life and I went through a lot of struggles that I didn\u2019t want to see him go into,\u201d Logan said. \u201cSo I did take him under my wing and try to be that figure for him.\u201d Ryan\u2019s uncommon maturity for his age helped has helped him navigate life without his biological father. He said he holds no bitterness and isn\u2019t motivated to perform on the field to prove anything to the man who helped bring him into the world. \u201cAt this point I would say that\u2019s just out of the picture,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cIt\u2019s something I don\u2019t even concern myself with because of the amount of role models I\u2019ve had in my life. They\u2019ve molded me into the person I am today and I\u2019m nothing but grateful for it.\u201d Colleges take noticeLogan quickly learned that Ryan has the athletic gifts to go with his off-the-field demeanor. In Logan\u2019s first day at practice at Walker\u2013Grant, Ryan took a quarterback sweep to the end zone on a long touchdown run. \u201cNobody was within 20 yards of him,\u201d Logan said. \u201cOn the next play, he\u2019s my starting safety and he takes a pick-six to the house. I\u2019m just like, \u2018Wow. This kid is special. He\u2019s a major talent.\u2019\u201d Ryan went on to become a starting defensive back and wide receiver for JM his freshman and sophomore seasons before a breakout junior campaign. He was named first-team all-Battlefield District, all-Region 3B, All-Area and second-team all-state in 2019. He recorded 54 tackles (34 solo), 11 pass breakups and one interception. He also forced three fumbles. He has 10 career interceptions, including three returned for a touchdown. Logan said Ryan should excel at the college level. \u201cWith his work ethic, his brains in the books and his football IQ, the only thing that\u2019s stopping Aidan would be an injury or him second-guessing himself,\u201d Logan said. \u201cWhen he goes out, just plays football and has fun. He\u2019s one of the best athletes in the state of Virginia.\u201d Ryan is also an all-state long jumper for JM\u2019s track and field team and planned to play lacrosse for the first time this season before the pandemic forced the cancellation of spring sports. As JM\u2019s starting quarterback last fall, he passed for 1,254 yards and 12 touchdowns, while rushing for 690 yards and five scores. He played sparingly as a receiver and finished with 14 catches for 187 yards and a touchdown. He had two kickoff returns for a score, including a game-winning 69-yard sprint with less than three minutes remaining in a 22\u201321 comeback win over King George. He\u2019s rated a three-star recruit by 247sports.com. \u201cHe can do it all,\u201d said James Monroe newly hired head coach George Coghill, who has been on JM\u2019s staff since Ryan was a sophomore. \u201cHe can run. He can be physical. He has great ball skills. He\u2019ll be able to high-point the ball \u2026 We\u2019ve had him all over the place, so he hasn\u2019t been able to specialize in one position and get that next-level coaching. I think once he gets that and he truly learns that position, he\u2019s going to be a force to be reckoned with.\u201d Ryan collected more than 30 Division I scholarship offers, including three from \u201cPower Five\u201d conference programs Virginia, Louisville and Vanderbilt last month. After the Cavaliers followed up Louisville\u2019s offer with one of their own, Ryan was just about certain that\u2019s where he\u2019d end up. Although he announced his plans on Sunday, he can\u2019t officially sign a national letter of intent until the early signing period begins in December. \u201cI just thought about it and there\u2019s no place I\u2019d rather be,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cUVa has felt like home ever since my first visit and in reality that is home because it\u2019s my home state. I feel like there is value behind growing up in your home state and having the chance to represent them once you grow up.\u201d","380":"A season ago, the Virginia football team reached the highest point of the Bronco Mendenhall era. The Cavaliers finally beat Virginia Tech, winning the ACC Coastal Division in the process and earning a spot in the Orange Bowl. With a quality defense returning and solid pieces along the offensive line, the Cavaliers could very well contend for the division title again in 2020. That\u2019s if the Cavaliers take the field in 2020. COVID-19 stopped spring sports in its tracks. UVa softball\u2019s first season at Palmer Park ended abruptly, and the baseball team saw its season end soon after becoming nationally ranked. Men\u2019s lacrosse\u2019s national title defense will have to wait another season. As the virus continues to impact the United States, it\u2019s unclear when sports at large may return. The PGA Tour plans to resume play on June 11, but starting a professional golf tour is much different than ramping up collegiate sports nationally. There are a handful of critical factors that will determine whether collegiate athletic programs, including UVa\u2019s teams, take the fields and courts in the fall. A series of steps need to take place for Virginia athletics to return. Students back to Grounds If this doesn\u2019t happen, UVa won\u2019t play sports in the fall. \u201cObviously, we need to have students back on grounds before football can begin,\u201d UVa president Jim Ryan said on CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation\u201d on Sunday. \u201cBut our athletic director, Carla Williams, and our head football coach, Bronco Mendenhall, are committed first and foremost to the safety and well being of their players, our student-athletes. And they\u2019ll begin practice when the medical experts tell them it\u2019s safe to do so.\u201d College football \u2014 and college sports in general \u2014 won\u2019t return until students can return to campuses. Understandably, it needs to be safe for colleges to be open for collegiate athletics to take place. UVa went to all online classes over its spring break. Students went home or stayed at their respective homes following the break, aside from a few students who were safer staying in Charlottesville. Ryan expects more clarity on UVa\u2019s decision on whether to bring students back to grounds in June. \u201cWe are in the midst of trying to figure out how we can have as many students back on grounds in the fall and in classrooms and to do that safely,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cWe\u2019re working night and day to figure out exactly how to do that, and we\u2019ll make an announcement about the fall in mid-June.\u201d He added that the university wants to push back the decision as far as possible to gather information, but also understands the need to give students time to prepare following the university\u2019s decision. Mid-June gives UVa a month to gather more information while also leaving a few months before the start of the fall semester. Testing capacity increases For students to return to grounds for the fall semester, Ryan wants to test both faculty and students upon their arrival at the university. If someone tests positive for COVID-19, they would then quarantine. UVa\u2019s website says the university had 24,639 students \u2014 both graduate and undergraduate \u2014 on grounds during the 2017-18 academic year. Add in every professor, cafeteria workers, janitors and more, and the sheer volume of tests the university needed to reopen would likely be upward of 30,000. If other Virginia universities follow the same protocol of testing everyone before reopening, Virginia universities could require well over 100,000 tests at the end of August. \u201cWe are in contact with the Department of Education, and I\u2019m also in close contact with my colleagues at Virginia colleges and universities, and we are all trying to work against the same challenge,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cMy hope is that there will be a set of guidelines that we can all agree to and all follow, but not all of us are in the same situation as well.\u201d As of Sunday, about 150,000 total tests were conducted across Virginia since the pandemic. While healthy people aren\u2019t being tested, going from a goal of 10,000 tests a day across the state \u2013 something Gov. Ralph Northam has stressed in recent days \u2013 to suddenly needing 25,000 tests just for UVa students is a noticeable leap. Tests on healthy returning students need to be done without impacting the ability of a sick person to receive the test. Testing capacity needs to improve in the next few months for UVa to feel comfortable opening in the fall, and the university needs to open in the fall for its athletic programs to start competing again. Social distancing In addition to testing, contact tracing and quarantining, Ryan wants to follow proper social distancing guidelines should students return in the fall. He says the university will need rules for how close students can be in both classrooms and dining halls. \u201cAs you can imagine, it\u2019s a complicated task,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cCollege campuses are a difficult and challenging place for contagious viruses.\u201d If UVa limits large gatherings, that could alter the dining halls and classrooms, and it would also alter attendance at sporting events. UVa brought in an average of 47,811 people for its 2019 home football games. The home-field advantage helped lead to wins, and it also brought in revenue from ticket sales. Expecting the same level of attendance in the fall seems unlikely given the current state of affairs. Social distancing restrictions could lead to scenarios ranging from games without fans to limited fan attendance with at least six feet between fans not in the same family. With months until the season\u2019s projected start, plenty of options seem logical at this point. UVa and other schools need to narrow in on a solution in the coming months. On the field, other questions remain. Is it safe for athletes to play close-contact sports? Would the bottom of a pileup after a fumble be safe for athletes? Would a competitive battle for the ball in soccer that involves grabbing of the opponent\u2019s jersey be deemed safe? Testing matters for those safety reasons as well. Considering people can transmit the virus without showing symptoms, a simple temperature check might not suffice. Student-athletes may need to be tested before each practice or game so a player who tests positive can be withheld from the practice or game and then quarantined. These ideas may seem outlandish, but at the professional level, athletes could potentially sign waivers before competing ensuring they wouldn\u2019t sue the organization if they contract the virus. That same luxury seems less likely at the amateur level. In terms of on-field results, quarantines could be detrimental to a team\u2019s on-field success. Imagine UVa football losing its starting quarterback for multiple weeks due to a positive test for COVID-19. A team like Clemson losing star quarterback Trevor Lawrence heading into its game with UVa would boost the Cavaliers\u2019 chances of picking up an upset victory. Those quarantines could drastically alter the trajectory of the season. On a larger scale, what if the majority of a team tests positive due to their close proximity to each other? Would a team have to miss two weeks of the season to quarantine? Could a handful of teams \u2014 or even dozens of teams \u2014 be forced to miss multiple weeks? Health is the most important factor when bringing collegiate athletics back, but it\u2019s impossible to ignore the on-field scenarios that could play out in the coming months if collegiate sports return. Practice time Bronco Mendenhall told the media in March that he\u2019s planning for an altered practice schedule. Each athletic program needs practice time before actually starting their competitive schedules. \u201cI believe it\u2019s really helpful to start with the end in mind, so we\u2019re acting as if we\u2019re making preparations as if we won\u2019t have spring practice, that we possibly won\u2019t have players here for summer school any session and possibly we won\u2019t have the opportunity for anything other than fall camp to begin and knowing that fall camp timing might even be pushed back,\u201d Mendenhall said. UVa\u2019s head football coach believes that while it\u2019s less than ideal, a limited practice schedule could work for the football team. \u201cThe reality is, we\u2019re all capable as professionals to get our teams ready with whatever time frame that we have,\u201d Mendenhall said. \u201cI\u2019m sure everyone will work to do the best to make sure that everyone has an equal opportunity to do that, whenever that is, and there\u2019s all kinds of options that could happen.\u201d Even as UVa looks to replace quarterback Bryce Perkins, Mendenhall is willing to embrace whatever challenge lies ahead. \u201cSpring practice has huge benefits for player development, especially when you have a new quarterback, however to say that you can\u2019t get a team ready without that just isn\u2019t true,\u201d Mendenhall said. Mendenhall said on the media call in March that he was preparing as if the team wouldn\u2019t practice until about Aug. 1. If a heavy contact sport like football can return with about a month or so of practice, it seems reasonable to expect other sports like soccer or golf or field hockey to also return to game shape without increasing injury risk in a similar time frame. The bottom line There are still more questions than answers at this point, but Ryan\u2019s announcement in June will provide clarity. If UVa students return to grounds in the fall, athletic programs can plan a return. If not, expect a longer wait for UVa athletics. If students are allowed to return to grounds, the focus shifts to increased testing capacity and social distancing protocols. If the Cavaliers play sports in the fall, it could be a fall season unlike any other. \u201cOur hope, obviously, is that there\u2019s a football season this fall,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cI don\u2019t imagine it will look like normal football seasons, just like I don\u2019t imagine even if we have all students back on grounds, it will look like a normal semester. It will not be a normal semester next fall, regardless of which path we follow.\u201d","381":"The Virginia men\u2019s lacrosse program has added an offensive weapon to its 2021 roster. Charlie Bertrand will join the team as a graduate transfer, according to a report from Inside Lacrosse. Bertrand will transfer from Merrimack, using the additional year of eligibility granted to spring sports athletes by the NCAA. When Bertrand started his career at Merrimack, the school played at the Division II level. In 2020, before the season was cut short by COVID-19, Merrimack made the leap to the Division I level. In three seasons as a Division II player, Bertrand excelled. He scored at least 50 goals in every season despite never playing more than 18 games in a season. He scored 52 goals and added a career-high 23 assists as a freshman. A year later, Bertrand tallied 62 goals. As a junior, Bertrand\u2019s numbers swelled. He scored a remarkable 78 goals in 16 games to go with 19 assists. He won Division II Player of the Year honors as a junior and was shared the honor with a fellow Division II competitor as a sophomore. Bertrand was the only Division II player named to the Tewaaraton Watch List in 2019. Merrimack struggled with the adjustment to the Division I level, going 1-5 in its six games, but Bertrand didn\u2019t miss a beat. He scored 18 goals and added five assists in those six contests. At 6-foot-3 and 220 pounds, the left-hander gives UVa another solid attacker. UVa\u2019s senior attacker Michael Kraus opted to turn professional instead of using an extra year of eligibility. He was recently drafted by the Connecticut Hammerheads with the No. 2 overall pick in the Major League Lacrosse Draft. With Kraus out of the picture, it opens up more room for Bertrand at attack.","382":"The Virginia football team\u2019s defense tied for ninth nationally in 2019 in sacks per game. The Cavaliers gave opposing quarterbacks nightmares. While the Wahoos created havoc in opposing backfields, the linebackers were frequently tallying the sacks. The eye-popping stats showed up in the box score for the linebackers who finished plays. UVa\u2019s linebackers were tremendous in 2019, but part of their success was due to the solid play of the defensive line. By occupying offensive linemen and generating a push, the defensive linemen paved the way for the linebackers to rack up sack after sack. With a core group returning in 2020, the Cavaliers\u2019 defensive line could show similar production when the group next takes the field. Returners There\u2019s a long list of key returners for UVa\u2019s defensive line. From Jowon Briggs in the middle to Mandy Alonso and Richard Burney on the outside, the Cavaliers have a talented group up front. Aaron Faumui also played well last season and figures to contribute significantly. Jordan Redmond adds depth at the nose tackle position. Briggs might be the most exciting prospect along the defensive line. The rising sophomore checks in at 295 pounds but plays fast and explosive. He finished with 19 tackles, three tackles for loss and a sack in 13 games played. He started seven contests. \u201cJowon\u2019s strong as an ox,\u201d linebacker Charles Snowden said. Snowden added that Briggs was one of the players he was most excited to see compete in spring practices before they were canceled due to COVID-19. \u201cHe\u2019s very, very strong, very athletic,\u201d former UVa defensive lineman Eli Hanback said. \u201cHe\u2019s a real smart kid, too, so I think his ceiling is very, very high. I\u2019m looking forward to seeing what he can do because even as a true freshman he was manhandling at some dudes at practice and even in games.\u201d Briggs provides an anchor in the middle of the defensive line, while many of the other players along the line are versatile and can play defensive end in UVa\u2019s 3-4 scheme. They\u2019re big enough to stop the run and athletic enough to get after the passer. When it comes to key returners, the Cavaliers should feel good at offensive line. Departures Losing Eli Hanback to graduation hurts. Hanback was very consistent throughout his four years in Charlottesville, and it\u2019s always good to have trustworthy and reliable players along the defensive line. In four seasons, Hanback played in 52 games and started 48 of those games. He finished with 176 tackles, 21.5 tackles for loss and nine sacks. Last season, he finished with 8.5 tackles for loss and 4.5 sacks. Both as a leader and contributor, Hanback helped UVa\u2019s defense. The Cavaliers also lose Vic So\u2019oto, their defensive line coach. Born in California, he recently accepted the same position at USC. New additions Three freshmen join the defensive line group in 2020. Jahmeer Carter is a three-star prospect from Maryland who projects as a nose tackle. Given the presence of Briggs and Redmond, it wouldn\u2019t be a shock to see Carter redshirt. Olasunkonmi Agunloye offers great size at the defensive end position. He checks in at about 6-foot-6 and 240 pounds. While he may need to add some additional weight to fit into a 3-4 scheme, Agunloye plays physically and is a good addition at defensive end. Nusi Malanai, a 6-6 defensive end prospect possesses similar size to Agunloye. He\u2019s a physical player who overwhelmed high school offensive linemen. All three players help add depth, but given the team\u2019s group of returners, it wouldn\u2019t be a surprise to see any of them redshirt. Clint Sintim, a former UVa player, joins the coaching staff as its new defensive line coach. He had coached Delaware\u2019s outside linebackers and defensive ends for the past three seasons. \u201cVic did a good job for us,\u201d co-defensive coordinator Nick Howell said. \u201cVic\u2019s a close personal friend, I appreciate what he did for us, but I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll miss a beat with Clint.\u201d 2020 outlook Aside from a new coach and the departure of Hanback, the 2020 defensive line should look quite similar to the 2019 group. Virginia returns depth and production. UVa fans should expect a good season from the defensive line.","383":"Swofford started the call by saying there are more questions than answers. While questions are abundant and answers are scarce, Swofford tried to provide some clarity on the future ahead. Anticipating the fall After discussing the ACC spring meetings and a few other topics such as ACC budgets, Swofford arrived at the topic of playing fall sports. The ACC commissioner expects teams to compete in the fall. \u201cWe are going into this year with the anticipation of playing at this point in time,\u201d Swofford said. \u201cMost all of our institutions are indicating that they intend to open in various fashions as we go into the fall, but there\u2019s a lot that can happen between now and then.\u201d Swofford says the league\u2019s plan as of mid-May is to play sports in the fall with campuses open to students. With that in mind, Swofford knows how quickly plans can change. Back in March, the ACC hoped to finish the men\u2019s basketball tournament on the Thursday morning of the event. By the afternoon, the tournament was canceled. By the weekend, spring sports were canceled. The sports world amid COVID-19 is unpredictable, which is why the ACC is operating with a few different plans in mind. Four roads ahead There are four potential paths for ACC sports this fall with regards to collegiate football and basketball. 1. The football season starts on time and is played in its entirety 2. There\u2019s an abbreviated college football season 3. The college football season is canceled, but basketball plays its season 4. No collegiate sports for the 2020-21 academic year Swofford quickly added that he doesn\u2019t anticipate the fourth option happening, but the league wants to prepare for the worst case scenario just in case. Learning from the upheaval of the men\u2019s basketball conference tournament, Swofford and the ACC want to make informed decisions slowly as new information comes in. He knows how quickly things can change. \u201cNot a lot of answers yet, and you don\u2019t want to make decisions in these circumstances when you have such a limited amount of information on what the circumstances will be in just a couple of months,\u201d Swofford said. The decision-making process moving forward will also include a COVID-19 medical team established by the ACC to help share insights on how to safely return to athletic competition. No students Is there any chance college football or any collegiate athletic events could be played without students on campus? \u201cThat decision may change from institution to institution,\u201d Swofford said. \u201cThat seems foreign to me, personally, because we\u2019re part of an educational setting and intercollegiate athletics are students playing sports.\u201d UVa President Jim Ryan shared a similar sentiment Sunday in an interview with CBS, saying, \u201cObviously, we need to have students back on grounds before football can begin.\u201d It\u2019s hard to imagine ACC schools playing sports while also determining that it\u2019s unsafe for students other than student-athletes to be on campus. Given comments from Swofford and Ryan, it seems like a given \u2014 at least from UVa \u2014 that with the current information and knowledge of the virus there won\u2019t be collegiate sports in the fall unless students are able to safely return to campus. If students safely return to campus \u2014 even with social distancing practices in place \u2014 that would leave open the possibility for schools to compete in athletic events. With the current information, UVa students need to be on grounds for UVa fall sports to begin. Incomplete ACC Another hypothetical emerges when looking at the potential of starting collegiate sports even if a university or two from the ACC doesn\u2019t participate. Could the ACC continue on with college football if schools like Syracuse and Boston College decided it was unsafe for their student-athletes to compete but other schools differed based on the situation in their states? \u201cI think probably so,\u201d Swofford said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what the threshold is on that.\u201d For that hypothetical, Swofford and the ACC would need a set number of teams able to participate before moving forward. It\u2019s unlikely that a four-team ACC would play football games in the fall, but a 12-member league may very well press forward for the fall even if it leaves two programs behind. \u201cI don\u2019t think some schools not being able to compete necessarily keeps a majority of the schools who could compete from competing, but again, it is premature to answer that question fully at this point,\u201d Swofford said. UVa\u2019s perspective Ryan expects a status update on UVa\u2019s fall academic plans in mid-June. That announcement will shed light into the likelihood of Virginia playing sports in the fall. If students are welcomed back to grounds, sports may soon follow. If students are asked to stay home and take classes virtually, it\u2019s unlikely UVa plays sports in that situation. In the meantime, UVa fans should keep tabs on other universities within the ACC. If ACC universities opt for online only classes, the chance of UVa playing collegiate sports in the fall drops. Virginia\u2019s perspective on the spread of the virus is aligned with the ACC\u2019s. First and foremost, it\u2019s important to return students to campuses safely. There are plenty of potential options for the ACC to select in the coming months, ranging from starting athletics on time in the fall to not playing sports for the entire academic year. Swofford believes the picture will become clearer in June and July. \u201cWe can get terribly hypothetical in all of this,\u201d Swofford said. At this point, it\u2019s a waiting game to see what happens next.","384":"While the feasibility of the season starting on time amid a sports world dramatically altered by COVID-19 remains a mystery, fans are hopeful. On paper, plenty of exciting matchups await. From Tom Brady\u2019s debut as a Tampa Bay Buccaneer to a quarterback duel between Deshaun Watson and Patrick Mahomes on opening night, good games line the 2020 schedule. For UVa fans, the schedule also includes a handful of interesting matchups featuring former UVa standouts. Here\u2019s a look at five must-watch NFL games for UVa football fans. Chiefs at Chargers When: Sept. 20 The second game of Joe Reed\u2019s rookie season comes at home against a former teammate in Kansas City safety Juan Thornhill. The second-year defensive back racked up 58 tackles and three interceptions as a rookie for the Chiefs before an ACL injury cut his season short. Even without Thornhill, the Chiefs rode their high-powered offense to a Super Bowl championships. With Thornhill back in the fold, the Chiefs\u2019 defense should continue to improve after a solid 2019-20 showing. The Chargers, on the other hand, will break in a new starting quarterback after deciding to move on from longtime signal caller Phillip Rivers. Former Virginia Tech standout Tyrod Taylor is an option, as is rookie Justin Herbert. Given Reed\u2019s versatility as a kick returner, running back and wide receiver, he\u2019ll likely see the field in at least some capacity as a rookie. Assuming Thornhill is fully healthy, both the Chargers and Chiefs will have healthy and impactful Wahoos on their rosters. Darius Jennings, a former UVa wide receiver, also signed with Los Angeles in the offseason and will compete for a roster spot. Falcons at Vikings When: Oct. 18 After five seasons in the league, Anthony Harris has developed into one of the top defensive backs in the NFL. He intercepted six passes in 14 games last season while also amassing 60 tackles. Harris turns 29 soon, and he\u2019s developed into a top-tier NFL defender before his 30th birthday. On Oct. 18, Harris and the Vikings welcome Kurt Benkert, Matt Schaub, LaRoy Reynolds and Olamide Zaccheaus into town. The Falcons boast four former Cavaliers on their roster. Benkert and Schaub will compete for the backup quarterback position this season, while Reynolds is a likely special teams contributor. Zaccheaus is in the running to make the roster as a wide receiver. There\u2019s a chance all four players make the active roster or the practice squad, and it\u2019s likely at least multiple players land on the 53-man roster. For UVa fans wanting to see former Wahoos compete, Harris is a budding star and the Falcons have plenty of UVa connections. Jets at Chargers When: Oct. 18 There\u2019s some uncertainty as to Bryce Hall\u2019s immediate availability for the Jets, but he expects to be healthy by training camp. It wouldn\u2019t be a surprise to see the Jets slowly work Hall back to health through preseason games and even the first few weeks of the season. If Hall returns and plays close to his form at UVa, the Jets have such a glaring need at cornerback that he could see meaningful snaps as a rookie. There\u2019s no guarantee he takes the field on Oct. 18, but the thought of Hall matching up with Chargers rookie and former teammate Joe Reed should excite UVa fans. Even if Hall isn\u2019t matched up with Reed, watching the rookie corner take on wide receivers like Keenan Allen and Mike Williams would be a sight to see. If Hall plays for the Jets in 2020, keep an eye on the Oct. 18 matchup. Jets at Chiefs When: Nov. 1 If Hall is healthy, the Nov. 1 matchup is ideal for UVa fans. Hall could be a solid piece in the secondary for the Jets, and Thornhill proved himself as a quality player last season. The former teammates will square off in Kansas City on the first day of November. If nothing else it\u2019s fun to watch the Chiefs play at home late in the season. Chiefs at Buccaneers When: Nov. 29 By November, Thornhill should be plenty healthy so there shouldn\u2019t be worries about last season\u2019s injury keeping him off the field this late in the year. Watching the talented defensive back take on Tom Brady and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers is worth the time commitment. A season ago, Thornhill made four tackles in a win over Brady and the New England Patriots. In addition to Thornhill\u2019s presence, the battle between Brady and Mahomes should make for must-watch TV for any football-loving Wahoo.","385":"Sammy Mueller expected her final season of collegiate lacrosse to come at Virginia. COVID-19 prematurely ended her final year in Charlottesville, but with the NCAA granting spring sport athletes an extra year of eligibility, Mueller\u2019s career lives to see another season. Only her final season won\u2019t come in Charlottesville. Mueller is headed to Northwestern to pursue a master\u2019s degree in project management with a specialization in real estate development while also finishing her collegiate athletic career. Northwestern isn\u2019t new for Mueller, whose older sister Ally played at the school. Ally Mueller finished her time at Northwestern in 2018, earning All-Big Ten honors as a senior. Now it\u2019s Sammy\u2019s turn to star for the proud program, which has won seven national championships since 2000. \u201cIt\u2019s bittersweet,\u201d Mueller said. \u201cI loved my time at UVa, and it was awesome playing here, but unfortunately, there wasn\u2019t a master\u2019s option here that would allow me to further enhance my undergraduate business degree.\u201d Northwestern offers a solid project management program with a real estate focus, and that\u2019s Mueller\u2019s career focus. Add in the storied lacrosse tradition and Northwestern is an ideal fit. UVa head coach Julie Myers would have welcomed Mueller back with open arms, but she understands Mueller\u2019s desire to play lacrosse and pursue a master\u2019s degree in her field. \u201cSammy was one of our all-time greats,\u201d Myers said. \u201cI think if we had a chance to finish out the season, certainly she would have broken some records and been in the top three to five in a lot of different categories, so a player that I would take back every time I get a chance.\u201d Myers believes Mueller\u2019s best lacrosse is still ahead of her, which is a scary thought for Big Ten teams next season. Mueller earned All-American honors three times during her UVa career, and she\u2019s one of the better players to take the field at UVa. Through three full seasons and the shortened 2020 season, Mueller finished with 165 goals and 50 assists. The midfielder did it all for the Cavaliers. \u201cI\u2019m happy she gets to play again,\u201d Myers said. \u201cI just wish it was here.\u201d With Mueller at Northwestern, Myers will keep tabs from afar and root for the former UVa star as she wraps up her collegiate career in the Big Ten. In addition to her elite talent as a goal scorer and passer, Mueller served as a leader for the Cavaliers. Her ability on the field was special, but her steady presence in the locker room helped the team. \u201cAs incredible as she is on the field, that pales in comparison to how wonderful a teammate she is,\u201d Charlie Campbell, UVa\u2019s goalkeeper and Mueller\u2019s first-year roommate, said. \u201cEvery accolade that\u2019s been heaped on her has been well deserved, but she could have gotten 10 more for how wonderful of a leader and friend that she is.\u201d One of Mueller\u2019s best traits was her reliability. The unflappable standout never wavered regardless of the situation or mounting pressure. If the Cavaliers needed a goal or a big play in an intense moment, they felt confident turning to Mueller. \u201cSammy was not fazed by anything that was thrown at her, and you always felt like when she was there, everything was going to be OK,\u201d Campbell said. Mueller starred in Charlottesville and while her collegiate career won\u2019t end in a UVa uniform, she\u2019ll go down as one of the best players and teammates in program history. The ending to her collegiate career wasn\u2019t what she originally planned, but the opportunity to go out on her own terms at Northwestern ensures one more women\u2019s lacrosse season with Sammy Mueller on the field. \u201cI think just the way the season ended, there\u2019s no closure, and so I think just being able to get to play one more year is just something that I\u2019ll cherish,\u201d Mueller said. \u201cIt\u2019s really an incredible opportunity.\u201d","386":"The former UVa pitcher, who plays in the Korean Baseball Organization, threw seven innings for the LG Twins. The game was televised live on ESPN2 on Wednesday morning. Two of Wilson\u2019s three starts this season have aired live on ESPN2. Despite the solid outing, Wilson and the Twins took the loss. They fell 3-1 to the Samsung Lions, dropping the Twins to 8-5 on the year. After a shaky first start of the 2020 season, Wilson threw six solid innings in his second start. He allowed two runs in that game and earned a no-decision. The Twins won that game, which was played on May 14, on a walk-off in the bottom of the ninth. Wilson performed well again Wednesday, throwing seven innings in his third start of the 2020 season. He tossed 92 pitches, allowing three runs (two earned) and striking out six. The right-handed pitcher allowed four hits and issued just one walk. On the season, Wilson has thrown 17 1\/3 innings and allowed 11 earned runs, giving him an ERA of 5.60. In his two most recent starts, Wilson has tossed 13 innings and allowed four earned runs, giving him an ERA of 2.77 across those two starts. The former UVa product hasn\u2019t received much run support, though. In the three games started by Wilson, the Twins have combined to score just nine runs. ESPN\u2019s broadcast gave insight into a professional sports league starting amid COVID-19. Umpires and coaches were among those wearing face masks and KBO games don\u2019t allow fans. The league may welcome limited crowds in coming weeks. ESPN also brought an LG Twins super fan onto the broadcast to describe the atmosphere during a typical KBO game with fans. The fan did more than just describe the atmosphere, as he and his wife sang songs for many of the batters, which is traditional during a KBO game with fans. It\u2019s a unique baseball atmosphere. The KBO game atmosphere without fans is a bit strange, but live baseball took place Wednesday, and a former UVa product took center stage. Wilson took advantage of the spotlight once again, finishing with another quality start in a nationally televised game.","387":"FREDERICKSBURG \u2014 Andrew Watson left high school last spring as one of the top singles players in Central Virginia. The former Monticello High standout added to his legacy this spring with a standout performance at the University of Mary Washington. Watson posted a respectable 6-5 record at the University of Mary Washington in his first collegiate season and Wednesday was named Intercollegiate Tennis Association\u2019s Rookie of the Year for the Atlantic South Region. \u201cI couldn\u2019t have won the Rookie of the Year award without my coaches, teammates and family,\u201d Watson said. \u201cI really appreciate everyone\u2019s support and encouragement as I pursue my dream. After college, I would like to continue to be involved in tennis. I see myself coaching other players and positively influencing the lives of others like my coaches have done for me.\u201d The road to college stardom was an interesting one for Watson. He picked up tennis in elementary school before making the switch to baseball until late in his high school career. He returned to tennis the spring of his junior year and Monticello coach Paul Shepherd placed him at the No. 1 spot in the lineup. He was immediately tested as he played against some of the state\u2019s top players, including Western Albemarle\u2019s Gavin Seagraves and Alex Ix, as well as Charlottesville\u2019s Cleve Packer. Seagraves (Navy) and Packer (UVa-Wise) are playing collegiately, while Ix is committed to play at Virginia Tech next year. As a senior, he posted a 13-3 singles record and reached the Region 3C singles championship match. Two of his three losses came to two-time champion Seagraves. \u201cMy biggest challenge was lack of experience,\u201d Watson said. \u201cGetting back into the routine of practicing every day and competing again helped prepare me for college tennis.\u201d Watson refined his game last summer and fall in preparation for life as a college athlete. His top goals were to earn a spot in the starting lineup, help his team compete for an Old Dominion Athletic Conference title as well as a spot in the Division III NCAA championships. The season only lasted 11 matches because of the COVID-19 pandemic, but Watson admits he was pleased with the progress he made in his first season. \u201cI really enjoyed my first season at Mary Washington,\u201d Watson said. \u201cIt was a great experience being able to compete against and practice with some of the best Division III college tennis players. Being in this environment provided me with the opportunity to improve my game tremendously.\u201d After posting a 3-3 record during the fall, Watson was penciled in at No. 3 singles for his first collegiate match this spring against a very competitive North Carolina Wesleyan team. The Eagles led 2-1 after singles, but Mary Washington Coach Todd Helbling knew the match would come down to one of the final matches. Watson lost his first doubles match, 8-6 with partner Priyan De Silva at No. 2 doubles, but rallied to defeat Jhonny Acosta 7-6 (7-3), 6-3 at No. 3 singles to help seal the win. \u201cI was excited to compete in my first team match,\u201d Watson said. \u201cI ended up winning my singles match at clinch the victory for the team. That was a big win for me and my team. We knew if we worked hard and pulled together as a team, we could do good things.\u201d The former Monticello posted a 4-2 singles record in the spring, including playing as high as the No. 2 line against Charleston on March 1. He posted victories against three opponents from nationally ranked schools. \u201cWith the season cut short, I wasn\u2019t able to accomplish all of my goals, but my individual game was improving and my team was playing well,\u201d Watson said. \u201cI worked my way into the starting lineup and was playing at the Number 3 spot when the season ended.\u201d One of the main things he missed was competing in more ODAC matches, including the annual rivalry match with Christopher Newport University But the good things outweighed the bad for Watson in his first college season. \u201cI really enjoy playing college tennis and being a part of a team,\u201d he said. \u201cThis year, I had the opportunity to participate in the recruiting process. I enjoyed meeting the new recruits and showing them around the UMW facility. In year 2, I feel I can take on more of a leadership role and help the new players transition from high school to college tennis players.\u201d","388":"Wednesday, the NCAA announced Division I football programs could begin voluntary workouts on June 1. Thursday, UVa head coach Bronco Mendenhall told reporters in a teleconference that UVa won\u2019t start its voluntary workouts on June 1. A start date for UVa to return to athletic activity has yet to be determined. \u201cEven though the NCAA has and is allowing voluntary workouts starting June 1, as we know in this environment, they\u2019re really not determining what\u2019s happening,\u201d Mendenhall said. \u201cThe states and each institution really are determining what is safe, and so we\u2019re following the state and CDC guidelines and working with our own medical people.\u201d Based on guidance from state and university officials, returning to grounds for on-campus workouts has not been deemed safe. Mendenhall and other UVa officials don\u2019t want to bring student-athletes to grounds until it\u2019s safe to do so and a plan is developed to safely conduct workouts, practices and competitions. It\u2019s one thing to bring student-athletes to grounds under social distancing guidelines. It\u2019s another to bring student-athletes playing and practicing contact sports. Both require significant planning and approval from state and university officials. In short, proper safety protocols are still needed for UVa\u2019s student-athletes to return to grounds. Protocols would likely include testing for COVID-19. Adequate testing would allow players and coaches to be tested for the coronavirus prior to practices and workouts. There may also be modifications to the team\u2019s workout facilities to help reduce the potential spread of the virus. \u201cAll of those plans are still in the works, and there so many different variables and so many different timeframes,\u201d Mendenhall said. \u201cI\u2019m on meetings almost every day and I haven\u2019t found any consistency yet from one day to the next. It changes so fast, and new dynamics and new problems come up.\u201d Housing, transportation and food all create other challenges that need to be planned for when students and student-athletes return to campuses. \u201cNo modifications have been done to this point, but about every scenario possible is being considered on how we might take this on when given the clearance to,\u201d Mendenhall said. Given the uncertainty, it\u2019s hard to know when UVa may return to athletic activity. UVa President Jim Ryan said earlier this month that he expected to announce UVa\u2019s plans for the fall semester in mid-June. Other ACC member schools, like Notre Dame and Syracuse, have shared plans for starting the fall semester with in-person classes, although some schedule modifications have been made, including ending in-person instruction around Thanksgiving. Reports surfaced Thursday that Louisville plans to bring football, men\u2019s basketball and women\u2019s basketball players back to campus in phases beginning on May 27. Voluntary workouts can begin on June 8. This, along with other Division I programs bringing players back to campus for voluntary workouts, could put UVa at a competitive disadvantage. Other programs might work with strength coaches and nutritionists on campuses, while UVa\u2019s athletes remain scattered across the country working out alone. \u201cAnyone that\u2019s providing that certainly could have an advantage, however, it still remains to be seen if it\u2019s safe to do so,\u201d Mendenhall said. \u201cIt still remains to be seen if June 1 is some magical date where the data has now supported people coming back. It might work just the other way where those coming back early might just have to stop, regroup and hold because it\u2019s too early.\u201d Mendenhall would love to have his team going through voluntary workouts, but he also knows there are questions from medical officials about whether a June 1 return truly makes sense. In Virginia, and at UVa, the guidance has the Cavaliers waiting longer than other universities might. UVa\u2019s head football coach does expect football in some capacity in the fall, though. Assuming it\u2019s safe, Mendenhall supports a fall season. \u201cI think football will start in the fall,\u201d Mendenhall said. \u201cIt\u2019s too soon to tell whether it will start on time and what it will look like. The way that I think about it simply is that football supports and enhances humanity. It is not in place of or more important than, and that\u2019s the way that I\u2019m going to support and run our team. When it\u2019s safe and when it\u2019s appropriate and when all can benefit, I\u2019m for playing the game.\u201d","389":"Bronco Mendenhall thinks there will be a fall football season. When his Virginia Cavaliers return to the field, they have their work cut out for them. Three of Virginia\u2019s first five games come against teams likely to enter the season ranked. Clemson may enter the season No. 1 overall, while Georgia is a top-10 caliber team, and UNC will likely find a spot in the preseason top 25. All three teams feature solid quarterbacks, with Clemson\u2019s Trevor Lawrence and UNC\u2019s Sam Howell among the best in the ACC. It\u2019s no surprise Clemson and UNC are expected to be among the ACC\u2019s best squads, as the best college football teams usually feature extremely productive quarterbacks. As Bryce Perkins showed in his two seasons at UVa, quarterback play can elevate a team to new heights. Arguably the biggest question mark surrounding UVa entering the 2020 season and critical early contests against top-25 caliber teams is its passing attack. Who will be Virginia\u2019s starting quarterback and who will he throw to? There\u2019s plenty to be sorted out at wide receiver heading into 2020, but the quarterback competition is expected to be a two-man race between returning quarterback Brennan Armstrong and Mississippi State transfer Keytaon Thompson. The athletic transfer has two years of eligibility remaining and can play immediately as a graduate transfer. Heading into the spring, Armstrong seemed like the clear-cut favorite to start. Thompson\u2019s addition adds significant competition for the starting role. By adding Thomspon, Mendenhall created a situation he felt was necessary. \u201cI simply don\u2019t believe you can win the ACC Coastal or win the ACC or have a successful football program without two very good quarterbacks,\u201d Mendenhall said. \u201cI loved the situation we had with Bryce [Perkins] and Brennan, and now I really like the situation we have with Brennan and Keytaon.\u201d Last season, when UVa won the ACC Coastal, offensive coordinator Robert Anae called plays differently with Armstrong healthy. When Armstrong missed a few games due to injury, the Cavaliers were more cautious with Perkins as the starter. They called fewer designed runs and aimed to keep Perkins out of harm\u2019s way when possible. The offense didn't generate as many explosive plays.\u00a0 With quarterback runs playing an important role in UVa\u2019s offense when led by Perkins, a healthy second quarterback meant the Wahoos could call plays aggressively and find consistent offensive success. The addition of Thompson makes the coaching staff feel like it has two starting-caliber quarterbacks on its roster. Armstrong is taking the addition of Thompson well. Mendenhall says Armstrong's demeanor and approach haven\u2019t altered. \u201cBrennan is confident, that\u2019s one of his greatest strengths, and he loves competition,\u201d Mendenhall said. \u201cHe really doesn\u2019t acknowledge anyone else. He focuses on what he can control.\u201d For Armstrong, that means he focuses on staying in shape and going through virtual team meetings. Thompson won\u2019t join UVa\u2019s team meetings until mid-June, when he finishes up his final class at Mississippi State. When Thompson does join the squad, he\u2019ll immediately be thrust into a competition for the starting job. The dual-threat player saw decent chunks of playing time for Mississippi State in both 2017 and 2018 before seeing his role reduced in 2019.\u00a0 Thompson made plays when he was on the field, scoring 18 career touchdowns, including 10 on the ground. Armstrong, on the other hand, knows offensive coordinator Robert Anae\u2019s system, and he\u2019s a dynamic player in his own right. He\u2019ll have a chance to win the job. The battle for the starting role won\u2019t fully play out until restrictions around COVID-19 ease and UVa can take the field for practices, but Thompson\u2019s addition helps shed light on what Mendenhall wants from his quarterbacks. Mendenhall wants at least two starting-caliber players, and he wants to develop a clear future at the position. Thompson will be on the roster through the end of the 2021 season. Armstrong stays through the end of the 2022 season. Ira Armstead, an incoming freshman, will be around through 2023 or longer if he redshirts. The Cavaliers have multiple quarterback prospects in their 2021 class who will join the mix in coming seasons. Much to Mendenhall\u2019s delight, the Cavaliers are starting to develop depth and a line of succession at quarterback. \u201cIt\u2019s eluded us to this point, but that is our hope,\u201d Mendenhall said. \u201cWe prefer to develop from within and have great succession planning, and to this point we haven\u2019t had the quality and volume of young quarterbacks to develop in that succession.\u201d","390":"At the beginning of May, UVa women\u2019s lacrosse head coach Julie Myers figured she\u2019d experience new feelings this weekend. After having the season cut short due to COVID-19, women\u2019s lacrosse teams across the country missed out on championship weekend, which would\u2019ve been Memorial Day weekend. With that date passing, Myers expected it to be easier to let go of the lost season. \u201cI do think that as we get to the Memorial Day weekend, when the season would have ended, I do think we\u2019ll all kind of breathe and let go a little bit because we\u2019re still very much connected and trying to stay competitive, just with academics at this point and with our own workouts as opposed to on a field,\u201d Myers said in early May. With Memorial Day weekend arriving, Myers and UVa women\u2019s lacrosse can relax. Classes are over, and the offseason has arrived. While players and coaches can take a mental break for the time being, the Cavaliers will enter the 2021 season hungry. They made the NCAA quarterfinals in 2019 after a few years of struggling to advance past the second round. In 2014, the Cavaliers made the NCAA semifinals. It\u2019s been over 15 years since Myers and UVa captured the 2004 national championship, and the program wants to return to the peak of the college lacrosse world. Reaching the pinnacle in 2021 will be a major challenge, as star midfielder Sammy Mueller is headed to Northwestern as a graduate transfer. Without Mueller, the Cavaliers need players to step up and score goals. Last season\u2019s results The shortened 2020 season showed UVa\u2019s potential. The Cavaliers rattled off four consecutive wins to open the season, including three against ranked teams, before going 1-3 in what turned out to be the final four games of 2020. UVa went 5-3 overall with a 0-2 record in ACC play. Virginia led No. 1 North Carolina 7-6 at halftime before the Tar Heels went on a late run to knock off the Cavaliers. Despite an 18-12 loss, UVa showed for 45 minutes that it belonged with one of the top teams in the nation. On the other hand, a few lapses kept the Cavaliers from beating teams like UNC and Duke. The potential was there for the Cavaliers to make a postseason run, and the success would\u2019ve been dependent on the team\u2019s development over the final half of the season. Notable departures The most notable departure for UVa is Sammy Mueller. The midfielder did everything for UVa, from winning draw controls to facilitating the offense to scoring goals. Without Mueller, who teammates describe as a steady presence and reliable weapon, UVa needs players to step up as goal scorers. \u201cSammy was not fazed by anything that was thrown at her, and you always felt like when she was there everything was going to be OK,\u201d goalkeeper Charlie Campbell said. Replacing an All-American talent with an unflappable demeanor isn\u2019t easy, but that\u2019s the task facing UVa next season. The team will also lose a few seniors, but it\u2019s unsure exactly which seniors will depart and which will stay. Myers says the additional year of eligibility granted to spring athletes makes the decisions tricky for a few athletes who may have jobs lined up following graduation. Key returners UVa\u2019s junior class is stacked. With a large group of rising seniors, the Cavaliers feel confident about their immediate future. Ashlyn McGovern and Taylor Regan both made noticeable impacts in the fall, and Olivia Schildmeyer performed well in her time on the field. All three players are attackers, which may help fill the goal-scoring void left by Mueller. Myers hopes a 12-person rising senior class embraces the disappointing 1-3 finish to the 2020 season and uses it as motivation to put together a special 2021 campaign. \u201cI think where we left off stings,\u201d Myers said. \u201cIt feels very unfinished. It felt like we never had a chance to really improve and redeem, but hopefully the girls in the third year class in particular are super hungry, and they\u2019re like, \u2018You know what, if this is where we left off last year, we\u2019re going to do it better and more consistently the following year.\u2019\u201d Rising junior Courtlynne Caskin enters 2021 season as a top option at midfield. She was second to only Mueller in goals in 2020, finishing with 16. Lillie Kloak, another rising junior, is another talented attacker who played well in 2020, finishing with 14 goals. There\u2019s tremendous talent returning. At goalkeeper, Charlie Campbell handles the bulk of the work. The rising redshirt senior knows UVa\u2019s program, and she\u2019s eager to take on a larger leadership role in 2021. Campbell, who calls herself a \u201cmama bear,\u201d says returning for another year is a tremendous opportunity and one she\u2019s grateful to have. She knows not everyone receives five years at an institution, and she\u2019s looking forward to being around her teammates for one more season. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I could be any happier than knowing I have another chance to be there,\u201d Campbell said. Future outlook Sammy Mueller is a star. She\u2019s headed to Northwestern. Losing a star athlete and leader leaves UVa searching for answers at midfield. Luckily, with about a dozen rising seniors, the Cavaliers find themselves with plenty of potential answers and budding leaders. UVa wants to take the step forward from a consistent NCAA Tournament team to a Final Four contender. Losing Mueller makes that goal more challenging, but UVa returns enough experience and talent to turn the goal into reality in 2021.","391":"COVID-19 altered the routine of organizations across the country. Social distancing and self-isolation led to changes in how groups go about their jobs. When possible, companies have turned to remote work. Zoom calls have become increasingly prevalent as teams hope to stay in frequent contact virtually. Planned projects have been tossed aside in recent months for new tasks as professional organizations adapt to the changing landscape caused by the novel coronavirus. The same is true for Bronco Mendenhall and the Virginia football program. Usually, the Cavaliers would\u2019ve spent March and April going through spring practices. Time would\u2019ve been spent evaluating the roster and developing talent in preparation for a challenging 2020 schedule. Instead, Mendenhall and the Cavaliers have thrown themselves into virtual recruiting. \u201cWe\u2019ve just shifted a lot of our focus that would have been on our team for spring practice into the talent acquisition and the selection process,\u201d Mendenhall said. \u201cAnd so we put increased emphasis on it. We\u2019ve designed protocols and processes that utilize technology, and we\u2019ve worked really hard.\u201d The hard work has led to 13 verbal commitments in UVa\u2019s 2021 recruiting class, including nine commitments since late March. This doesn\u2019t even include the addition of three transfers since mid-April, including two graduate transfers with immediate eligibility in 2020. According to 24\/7 Sports, UVa is one of just three ACC teams with at least 13 commitments in its 2021 class. Miami and North Carolina are the other two. Clearly, the increased focus on adding recruits is leading to results. Coupled with significantly improved on-field performance in the past few seasons under Mendenhall, the Cavaliers find themselves in a good position to add impactful recruits. \u201cComing off of the success and the growth of our program over the past four years, we have momentum,\u201d Mendenhall said. \u201cWe\u2019re leveraging that. Our messaging is really precise, and we put that with the right processes and the right emphasis and the yield is reflecting that.\u201d Recruiting virtually isn\u2019t easy, though. Developing a relationship with a recruit is critical, and Mendenhall told reporters a few months ago he won\u2019t add players he doesn\u2019t get along with personally. Like most coaches, Mendenhall wants to get to know the player to determine whether his program is a good fit for both sides. That\u2019s more challenging without in-person interaction, but the Cavaliers\u2019 coaching staff emphasizes transparency and honesty during the virtual process. This way the player knows exactly what they\u2019re getting themselves into if they commit to UVa. \u201cThe lack of human interaction has made it just a little bit more disconnected, and we\u2019ve had to work around that really hard to ensure that we could resolve any concerns and have the same relationship depth that we could\u2019ve as if we were in person, and we worked hard on doing that,\u201d Mendenhall said. There\u2019s no substitute for in-person interaction, but the Wahoos are making the most of virtual recruiting. Given the recent on-field success and the improved recruiting classes, Mendenhall is starting to feel confident in the team\u2019s depth. He believes UVa is closer to finding a clear succession plan at quarterback with a couple quarterback recruits joining the 2021 class. Along the offensive line, Mendenhall finally feels like the program can reload rather than rebuild. He hopes to add four offensive linemen in the 2021 recruiting class before then adding a few players each year in the future. There\u2019s growing confidence in the team\u2019s talent and depth. It\u2019s taken a few years, but Mendenhall believes the roster looks the part of a consistent ACC title contender. He\u2019s used his first four years at UVa to determine what the Cavaliers from recruits to win football games in the ACC. \u201cWe\u2019re just so much more clear of who will succeed at UVa, who will succeed in the ACC, who will succeed in our systems in the ACC, and who\u2019s going to thrive in the academic and social environment here,\u201d Mendenhall said. A clear focus combined with more time to recruit has the Cavaliers making a strong impression on the virtual recruiting trail this spring.","392":"Chris Newell and Nate Savino are years away from being able to legally buy beer. When they do reach legal drinking age, they\u2019re likely to have UVa fans lining up to buy them a pint. Despite having baby faces and birthdays this century, Newell and Savino are two of the top college baseball prospects in the country. Both left-handers showed promise as freshmen before COVID-19 ended the season before the Cavaliers embarked on the bulk of ACC play. \u201cIt almost felt like a high-school season, honestly,\u201d Newell said. \u201cWe played almost 20 games, and that\u2019s basically what you\u2019re going to get in a high school season.\u201d Savino, who graduated high school early to join the Cavaliers this spring, only tossed 10 2\/3 innings as he worked his pitch count up. He faced just 49 batters in his first year as a Cavalier. \u201cIt felt like I was barely there,\u201d Savino said. \u201cI mean, I kinda was barely there.\u201d It wasn\u2019t a long season, but both players made noticeable impacts for Virginia. Arguably, Savino\u2019s best start came in a four-inning outing against N.C. State. He allowed just one run against the ranked Wolfpack, and the Cavaliers won the series in part due to the freshman\u2019s performance in the rubber match of the series. The pitcher looks young, and UVa head coach Brian O\u2019Connor was quick to point out that Savino should\u2019ve been a high school senior in 2020, but when the lefty fires a fastball 93 miles per hour on the outside corner, it\u2019s clear to everyone in attendance that Savino belongs in college. Some batters likely wished the hard-throwing freshman turned professional after high school instead of joining UVa. Newell, a centerfielder, started the season ninth in the batting order. He also struck out more times (21) than any player on the roster. Despite plenty of early strikeouts, Newell caught fire during UVa\u2019s 18-game season, leading the team with a .407 batting average. He was one of four Cavaliers to blast four home runs and the only player to reach 20 RBI on the season. Showcasing speed on the bases, Newell led the team with eight steals. He\u2019s yet to be caught stealing a base in his young collegiate career. As the season progressed and the athletic freshman gained confidence, Newell rose up the batting order. He hit fifth in the team\u2019s final game of the season, going 3-for-4 in UVa\u2019s 4-3 victory over UMass Lowell. Newell and Savino weren\u2019t the only underclassmen to make major impacts for the Cavaliers in 2020. Freshmen Max Cotier tallied a team-high four triples in 74 at-bats. He drove in 15 runs and ended the season with a .338 batting average. When you add in sophomores Zack Gelof and Nic Kent, the four UVa players with the best batting averages in 2020 were all underclassmen. There\u2019s a youth movement in Charlottesville, and it bodes well for the team\u2019s future. O\u2019Connor likes that despite a shortened season, the freshmen were able to play 18 games and go through the full fall and early spring training programs. \u201cThey\u2019re different men now than they were 12 months ago,\u201d O\u2019Connor said. For Newell and Savino, the volume of work was the biggest adjustment to the college game. \u201cIn high school, you\u2019re obviously training throughout the year, but you\u2019re playing for 20, 30 some games depending on what school you go to,\u201d Newell said. \u201cEvery day was just a grind, so I had to get used to that and competing for a spot. You have to bust your tail every day, so you can\u2019t really take a day off.\u201d While Savino only took the field in games a few times as a freshman, his work outside of the spotlight increased while in Charlottesville. \u201cI\u2019ve never thrown this much in my life really,\u201d Savino said. \u201cNow I know what it\u2019s like, so I can prepare myself better and just be ready for next season.\u201d Both Newell and Savino credited academic advisors for helping them with academic load at UVa. They took advantage of academic coordinators and mentors as freshmen, which they say made the adjustment in the classroom smooth from high school to college. UVa\u2019s freshmen didn\u2019t play a full first season wearing orange and blue, but the future stars of the program gained valuable experience and showcased their potential. When the Cavaliers retake the field in 2021, Newell, Savino and the rest of the underclassmen know what it takes to succeed at the collegiate level. \u201cI\u2019m thankful that we did have the opportunity we had, and now they know what the expectation is,\u201d O\u2019Connor said. \u201cNow they know what goes into it, and they\u2019ll be more mature and ready to press forward into next year.\u201d","393":"College coaches love structure. Finding a routine for their program and helping student-athletes be efficient on the field and in the classroom is critical. Cancellations due to COVID-19 sent student-athletes off campus and to their respective homes. That change brought with it the absence of routine. Coaches are creatures of habit, however, and finding new routines quickly became the goal. With the cancellation of athletic activity occurring a few months ago, the Virginia football program has settled into its new routine. That routine starts every morning with an 8 a.m. team Zoom meeting. \u201cIf you\u2019re in Hawaii, you\u2019re waking up at 2 a.m., and you know we got guys all the way from Hawaii to California to Utah and Colorado all the way out to the east coast \u2014 Matt Gahm in Texas \u2014 so we got guys all over the country, which is kind of fun to see everybody popping up,\u201d co-defensive coordinator Kelly Poppinga said. There are also position group Zoom meetings. Poppinga, who also works specifically with the outside linebackers, hops on calls with his group to talk about workouts and old game tape. Rules centered on professionalism exist on the Zoom meetings, just like they would at an in-person team meeting. \u201cI love habits,\u201d UVa head coach Bronco Mendenhall said. \u201cI love learning, and I think that a Zoom screen can reflect intent. I think it can prove intent, and so we ask our players to prove their intent by what their screen looks like, and I\u2019m talking about lighting, I\u2019m talking about notebooks, I\u2019m talking about pens. We\u2019re talking about what they\u2019re wearing.\u201d Despite being in the comfort of their own homes, Mendenhall doesn\u2019t want his players to relax because of altered circumstances. The Cavaliers are preparing for an upcoming season, and that takes focus and buy-in from players and coaches, even in unusual times. Mendenhall, who led the Cavaliers to an Orange Bowl appearance in 2019 after a 2-10 record in his first season in Charlottesville, values preparation and discipline. While meetings are moved online and players hold themselves accountable for performing at-home workouts, Mendenhall maintains structure within the program to the best of his ability. \u201cWe have Zoom rules, and we hold them accountable to those Zoom rules,\u201d Mendenhall said. \u201cI\u2019m not currently evaluating practice, but what I can evaluate is their intent to learn, and not what they\u2019re saying but just by looking at screens. We make a point to ensure that we\u2019re showing what the proper comportment looks like and what it doesn\u2019t, and that\u2019s transparent in front of their peers.\u201d Taking advantage of the different circumstances created by COVID-19 motivates the UVa staff. Recruiting became the group\u2019s major focus with on-field player development halted in the spring. Mendenhall spearheaded the team\u2019s plan to emphasize recruiting. He wanted the Cavaliers to create a virtual environment that appealed to prospects and showcased what UVa is like for student-athletes. UVa quickly adapted to develop a recruiting structure designed for virtual visits. The result is a rapidly growing 2021 recruiting class ripe with three-star prospects. \u201cI think we had a great plan,\u201d Poppinga said. \u201cI think we were ahead of the curve. Coach Mendenhall has everything to do with that. He\u2019s always pressing us to make sure we stay ahead of other people, and I think we got ahead and used the technology that we had to be able to do some things that gave us the advantage before other people caught up to it.\u201d As other college football programs prepare to return to voluntary workouts in early June, the UVa football program remains away from grounds. The Cavaliers have yet to receive the go-ahead from state and local officials to bring student-athletes back to Charlottesville. For the time being, the Cavaliers feel content in their virtual routine. \u201cIf it was a regular year, they wouldn\u2019t be back anyway until mid-June,\u201d Poppinga said. \u201cTo me right now, there\u2019s no rush.\u201d","394":"Chapman, who has played at High Point since the 2016 season, will be eligible immediately for the 2021 season. \u201cWe could not be more excited to welcome Meredith to the Virginia women\u2019s lacrosse program,\u201d UVa head coach Julie Myers said. \u201cThere is no doubt her leadership and playing experience will add to our already talented team. She brings four years of experience and was voted team captain for two years by her teammates at High Point.\u201d The defender brings a tremendous amount of experience to Charlottesville. She played in a pair of games in 2016 before redshirting the rest of the season. She played 20 games in 2017, 2018 and 2019 before taking the field in five games in 2020 before COVID-19 caused the cancellation of the season. She\u2019s played in 67 collegiate games across the five seasons. She\u2019ll take advantage of eligibility relief given to spring athletes by suiting up for one more season as a Virginia Cavalier. In her time at High Point, Chapman excelled. She was named the Big South Defensive Player of the Year in 2019 and earned first team All-Big South honors in both 2018 and 2019. Chapman forces turnovers at a high rate, breaking High Point\u2019s single-season record in 2019 with 53 forced turnovers. She ranked sixth nationally with 2.6 forced turnovers per contest. She forced nine turnovers in five games in 2020. Chapman also helped the Panthers by securing 155 draw controls during her career. She\u2019ll add talent on defense for a UVa team that went 5-3 in a shortened 2020 season. \u201cMeredith is a speedy defender that will bring toughness and maturity to our program,\u201d Myers said. \u201cWe are excited to add another talented player to our defensive unit and our transition game.\u201d","395":"\u201cSend me as many GIFs as you can.\u201d That\u2019s the text Virginia football director of player personnel Justin Anderson sent Kevin Thurman, the director of marketing and a social media strategist for UVa athletics, at the beginning of April. COVID-19 temporarily took away collegiate sports. March Madness was lost, as were the seasons for spring sport athletes. The initial shock hit players and coaches, but ripple effects have affected all those involved in collegiate athletics, including social media teams. For Thurman, that means his days are spent helping the football\u2019s social team find GIFs or helping plan posts designed to engage prospective student-athletes. It also means thinking creatively and using virtual mediums to engage fans despite UVa teams not competing for the past two months. The Cavaliers could go five months or longer without competing due to the timing of the virus and summer being a slow period for collegiate sports. The break gives UVa an opportunity to hone in its social media efforts. \u201cI\u2019d say actually this time has helped us \u2014 I don\u2019t want to say change our focus because I think we\u2019ve always been focused on engaging with our fans on social \u2014 but more so refocus on that,\u201d Thurman said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been able to take this time and look at what we\u2019re doing and what are we doing for our fans, how are we providing for our fans?\u201d UVa has engaged fans with a variety of different social campaigns. The social team runs Wahoo Wednesdays, which have shared rebroadcasts of classic Virginia games with virtual watch parties of players and coaches who took part in the classic game. Former UVa men\u2019s basketball stars Joe Harris, Akil Mitchell and London Perrantes recently jumped on a virtual call to discuss the 2014 ACC Tournament championship game as it was rebroadcast on the ACC\u2019s social channels. Posts in recent months featured Twitter polls allowing fans to vote for the top UVa plays of the year with accompanying video showing those top plays. Despite an absence of live sports, fans could still watch the best plays from the games that were played in 2019-20. UVa\u2019s director of broadcasting, Dave Koehn has held \u201cHome with the \u2018Hoos\u201d interviews, speaking with Sean Doolittle, Val Ackerman and Malcolm Brogdon, among other people. These give die-hard fans a chance to catch up with former athletes. This Saturday will be dubbed \u201cWahoowa Saturday,\u201d and there will be plenty of virtual events throughout the day to celebrate UVa athletics. At 10 a.m., current coaches will kick off the event with a welcome message. Classic highlights and trivia will occur throughout the afternoon, and there\u2019s a virtual tailgate party scheduled for 12:30 p.m. Classic radio broadcasts take center stage from 1-6 p.m. A 4 p.m. re-broadcast on the ACC Network of a 2007 football game between UVa and Miami is the highlight of the day. Virginia beat the Hurricanes 48-0 in the contest, the final game played in the Orange Bowl, and there will be a watch party available on Twitter and Facebook featuring Al Groh as well as members of the team to discuss the blowout. The day ends with a singing of \u201cThe Good Old Song\u201d at 7 p.m. While there aren\u2019t live collegiate sports taking place, UVa\u2019s athletic social feeds remain active and produce content daily. Other colleges in the commonwealth have followed a similar strategy of remaining active and aiming to provide viewers with something positive to look forward to each week. Virginia Tech hosted a watch party of sorts toward the beginning of quarantine with head football coach Justin Fuente, who talked through the team\u2019s six-overtime win over North Carolina. He provided detailed insight into how the team handled quarterback injuries within the game and how he viewed the team\u2019s dramatic win. \u201cI think keeping our student-athletes, our coaches, our donors, our season-ticket holders, our fans, engaged is our role right now,\u201d Pete Moris, Virginia Tech\u2019s associate athletics director, said in late April. \u201cI think anything that provides a sense of normalcy or some sort of not COVID conversation, there\u2019s definitely an appetite for it right now.\u201d The Hokies\u2019 social feeds include interviews with players as well as a steady diet of images and videos of past highlights. With people spending more time inside to help prevent the spread of COVID-19, it\u2019s easy to become overwhelmed with news about the virus. Virginia Tech hopes its content provides an outlet for stress relief by helping fans relive historic moments or hear from players and coaches. Recruiting also plays a role in the use of social media by programs in Virginia. With coaches barred from visiting recruits in person due to NCAA regulations, social media is one of the main ways recruits can stay engaged with a university. A combination of strong social media use and frequent telephone or virtual calls with coaches may be the difference between landing a recruit and having the player commit elsewhere. \u201cOur coaches feel like one of the few ways they can be visible is through social media,\u201d Chris Kowalczyk, VCU\u2019s assistant athletic director for communications, said in late April. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to keep that in mind during this time. We want to be posting frequently. We want to be active, and we want to be sure we keep recruiting in mind.\u201d UVa also places an emphasis on recruiting, taking advantage of its video team when possible to provide content exclusive to prospective student-athletes. \u201cWomen\u2019s lacrosse wanted to do a virtual tour of grounds with their coaches, so one of our video staff members, Mike Schuler, went around grounds with them and filmed them at different spots talking about things and is putting together kind of a virtual tour that they can send recruits,\u201d Thurman said. The women\u2019s lacrosse program added a graduate transfer the same day Thurman spoke to The Daily Progress, indicating a positive result of the virtual tours. For UVa, its focus is on four groups: current fans, prospective fans, current student-athletes and prospective student-athletes. The athletic department crafts content aimed toward athletes as well as fans or potential fans. The content varies by medium, with Instagram posts being targeted more toward athletes or prospective athletes than Facebook posts. Virtual tours and active social media accounts can help land recruits. Much of the other content put out by UVa and other athletic departments in Virginia are designed to entertain fans, giving them something to look forward to in a stressful and uncertain time. Without live collegiate sports, team social media feeds can be the next best thing. \u201cIf I work every day thinking that we can have a positive impact on people\u2019s lives, that\u2019s fantastic,\u201d Kowalczyk said. \u201cThat\u2019s really great, and that does help, because this isn\u2019t the easiest environment to work in, but if you know you\u2019re maybe putting a smile on somebody\u2019s face one day, that certainly helps make it easier.\u201d","396":"A sign reading \u201c2015 National Champions\u201d sits just above the bullpen in right field at Disharoon Park. Framed Daily Progress front pages from the championship run sit within the facility. Postgame press conferences take place in the Hall of Fame room, which features trophies and photos from the best moments in program history. Virginia reached the top of the college baseball world in 2015, winning the College World Series. The reminders are constant. It\u2019s a proud program in a dedicated baseball community. Under Brian O\u2019Connor\u2019s leadership, the Cavaliers made 14 consecutive NCAA Tournament appearances. In 2018 and 2019, however, the Cavaliers fell short of that lofty mark, failing to qualify for the event. Entering 2020, the players openly discussed their goal of not just making the tournament but being one of the best teams in college baseball. Even players like freshman Chris Newell, who wasn\u2019t on the teams that missed the tournament, wanted to help UVa return to its 2015 level. \u201cIt was something I had been looking forward to for a while,\u201d Newell said. \u201cI was growing up during the time where they were in their prime. Big, bad UVa baseball going to the College World Series, winning the College World Series. It\u2019s just something that I wanted to try to do.\u201d They were well on their way toward the goal of returning to national relevance through the season\u2019s first 18 games. The Cavaliers were 14-4 with a series victory over N.C. State and commanding wins over most of their weaker nonconference foes. The results landed them in a few top 25 polls. Newell was batting over .400, and the team\u2019s lineup was producing. The pitching staff looked strong with Griff McGarry leading the way as the staff\u2019s ace and Andrew Abbott and Stephen Schoch developing into a lethal 1-2 punch in the late innings. Like so many sportswriters and analysts have muttered in the past few months, COVID-19 had other plans for this particular team. UVa\u2019s season abruptly ended after just 18 games, but the goal of returning to the top of the college baseball world is anything but canceled. The Cavaliers will return an abundance of young talent in 2021. From Newell to lefty starter Nate Savino to talented infielder Max Cotier, there\u2019s excellent talent among the team\u2019s rising sophomores. Zack Gelof and Nic Kent starred at the top half of UVa\u2019s lineup, and they\u2019ll be just rising juniors in 2021. Add in key returning veterans, and the Cavaliers have the making of a top-tier squad. Baseball America recently projected UVa as one of the eight teams to make the 2021 College World Series. A key reason for that prognostication is UVa\u2019s youth. Savino and Newell were capable of turning pro directly out of high school, but opted to attend UVa. \u201cI mean, for me, I wasn\u2019t the smartest kid in high school, so being able to come to UVa because of baseball was a huge opportunity,\u201d Savino said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t going to pass it up, and it\u2019s a great program. I\u2019ve loved it. I\u2019ve watched UVa my whole life. It\u2019s always my dream school.\u201d Academics helped draw in Savino, a hard-throwing lefty pitcher. Newell echoed those thoughts, stressing that he wanted more time to develop and mature before turning professional. Playing at UVa gives him that chance. Several players in Virginia\u2019s upcoming recruiting classes also have outstanding resumes with professional potential. Kyle Teel, a 2020 recruit, will bypass the MLB Draft to play at Virginia. He recently won Gatorade Player of the Year honors in New Jersey. Nick Bitsko, another 2020 prospect, is the Pennsylvania Gatorade Player of the Year. Bitsko may turn pro immediately, depending on what happens in the 2020 MLB Draft. Jay Woolfolk, a 2021 recruit who expects to play both football and baseball at UVa, won Virginia Gatorade Player of the Year this year. The Cavaliers keep adding top-flight talent with a burning desire to bring another championship to Charlottesville. \u201cMy first dream is to win a national championship at Virginia,\u201d Teel said, \u201cand my second dream is to be a big leaguer.\u201d Newell knew Teel from high school, and the two talked when Teel was deciding between staying in the draft and going all in on attending UVa. The two share similar sentiments about why they\u2019re attending UVa and what they what to deliver to UVa baseball. \u201cThe big thing for me personally, when I wanted to come here, I wanted to bring UVa baseball back to the caliber that it was,\u201d Newell said. \u201cI told him the same thing and he was like, \u2018Yeah, I totally agree. I want to go back to the College World Series and bring us back there and kind of put baseball back on the map in Charlottesville and start drawing crowds again.\u2019\u201d O\u2019Connor emphasized that plenty of top-tier Division I programs bring in players capable of playing professionally out of high school. UVa isn\u2019t the only program adding stellar recruiting classes. On the other hand, for a team that\u2019s come up shy of the NCAA Tournament in consecutive seasons, the Cavaliers are trending in the right direction. That stems largely from adding committed and talent youngsters. \u201cIt starts from the type of people you recruit and the families that you recruit,\u201d O\u2019Connor said. \u201cThey value education, they value their experience, and it\u2019s not just a degree that you put up on the wall. It\u2019s the education, it\u2019s not the degree, and the education comes from every day. It comes from the classroom, but it also comes from the education they have just being a person in the community, a person at UVa, learning from the baseball experience, learning from their teammates and peers.\u201d In O\u2019Connor\u2019s eyes, it takes a special offering featuring education, community and baseball tradition to consistently land some of the best recruits in the game. He believes UVa offers that, and recruits embrace all of it when committing to Virginia. \u201cIt\u2019s the whole package,\u201d he said. With top-shelf talent coming to Charlottesville, the Cavaliers\u2019 goal of returning to Omaha becomes more realistic. COVID-19 canceled UVa\u2019s season, but the mission of making the College World Series is only on pause.","397":"Mike Cubbage saw the peak of Major League Baseball. As a special assistant to the general manager with a focus on player scouting, Cubbage helped the Washington Nationals win a World Series crown in 2019. A year later, he\u2019s facing a much different situation. Due to COVID-19 and baseball\u2019s current postponement, the former University of Virginia star, Valley Baseball League Hall of Famer, former Major League Baseball veteran and Charlottesville native is unsure when he\u2019ll next see a MLB game. \u201cI mean, we\u2019re all just sitting around waiting,\u201d Cubbage said. \u201cNo one knows what\u2019s going to happen.\u201d Currently, Major League Baseball and the Major League Baseball Players Association are negotiating what a 2020 season might look like. The hope is for a season to begin in July, but the negotiations don\u2019t seem to be progressing particularly well. There\u2019s still uncertainty on if, and when, the baseball season might begin. \u201cI know through the years those negotiations are tedious,\u201d Cubbage said. \u201cThey are drawn out and may take a while and with something like this, no one\u2019s ever experienced it before. I\u2019m sure there are a lot of issues that need to get resolved, but hopefully they\u2019ll play baseball again.\u201d When baseball does resume, Cubbage wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see his role on the Nationals altered. Cubbage spoke to The Daily Progress in mid-May as he was finishing up a weekly assignment for the Nats. His weekly task was to rank the players of the three MLB organizations he followed and filed reports on a season ago. This means ranking the players for the Boston Red Sox, Cincinnati Reds and Tampa Bay Rays. The experienced baseball professional had a new set of teams to track and evaluate this season, but if the season begins, he doesn\u2019t expect his work to involve as much travel. Instead of watching teams in person, he may be left to watch from afar through video. \u201cClubs have cut back, and they\u2019re keeping everyone at home,\u201d Cubbage said. \u201cBy doing that, they\u2019re saving money on expenses because when we\u2019re all working it\u2019s quite an expense account for the entire department of amateur and professional scouts who are always on the road traveling on planes and hotels.\u201d Depending on how long restrictions remain in place regarding COVID-19, it may make sense for organizations to cut back on travel and only send scouts to locations when they can\u2019t evaluate players on film. The novel coronavirus has thrown a curveball into Cubbage\u2019s life, which has been spent around the game of baseball for the better part of five decades. He was drafted out of UVa in 1971 by the Washington Senators before eight seasons in the majors. He eventually went onto coach in the minor leagues, while also serving as the interim manager for the New York Mets in 1991 before eventually transitioning to scouting. His work as a player, coach and scout led him to be elected into the Virginia Sports Hall of Fame as part of the 2020 class. He learned of the news in November of 2019, and the news became official in December. \u201cI got the call back in, I want to say early November, just the week after the Nationals won the World Series, so I was still riding high from that,\u201d Cubbage said, \u201cand then to get that call saying I\u2019ve been elected into the Hall of Fame, it capped off quite a nice year.\u201d The Hall of Fame ceremony was scheduled for April of this year, but it was postponed until April 2021. COVID-19 changed Cubbage\u2019s immediate plans after a stellar 2019. Despite the changes, he\u2019s taking the adjustments in stride and waiting for word of when baseball might start up again. Until then, the accomplished baseball veteran can always take a moment to remember his banner year that included helping the Nationals win a World Series title. \u201cWell, it was thrilling,\u201d Cubbage said. \u201cIt really was.\u201d","398":"Theresa Matthews\u2019 family playfully joked in March that her dream job of working in the fan engagement side of sports could be rendered irrelevant by COVID-19. In the subsequent months, sports across the U.S. screeched to a halt and the future of mass gatherings at sporting events remains largely uncertain. Matthews graduated in May, and now she\u2019s on the search for a job in sports that she knows could be like finding a needle in a haystack, at least for the next few months. \u201cThat was kind of a joke and then it turned serious, and it\u2019s like I\u2019m graduating college in my childhood home,\u201d Matthews said. Fortunately for Matthews, she\u2019s able to live at home and search for jobs. Her family supports her and is willing to let her search for a job in sports for as long as it might take for sports to return and for fans to return to the stands. \u201cThat is never what I thought was going to happen, but I\u2019m currently really fortunate and blessed where I\u2019m in a position where it\u2019s not really needed that I get a job at the moment,\u201d Matthews said. Matthews isn\u2019t the only UVa student struggling to find a job in the sports industry following graduation. Katia Rabinowitch also graduated in May, becoming the 12th member of her family to graduate from Virginia. For Rabinowitch, being unable to walk the lawn in May stung, especially considering how much the tradition means to her family. Her final semester was drastically altered, and her job search offers plenty of uncertainty. Rabinowitch enjoys working with children and people in the community, and she\u2019s hoping to eventually land a community relations position within an athletic organization. Currently, however, her job search has proved challenging. \u201cIt\u2019s been a hard one for everybody,\u201d Katia said. \u201cI think what I have to come to terms with \u2014 and I kind of have\u2014\u2013 but this virus is affecting everybody in their job search. It\u2019s not just graduates or anything like that. It\u2019s everybody looking for a job, people who got laid off because of the virus.\u201d With unemployment numbers across the United States reaching record highs, it\u2019s no surprise to see fewer recent graduates finding jobs, especially in the sports industry. When teams aren\u2019t playing games and bringing in revenue, it\u2019s hard for them to bring in additional employees. Instead, sports organizations find themselves furloughing or laying off employees. In some cases, teams won\u2019t need to return to normal staffing levels until games and fans return. Chad Whych, a rising senior at UVa, applied for over 100 internships related to marketing, including many at companies outside of sports. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t been going well,\u201d Whych said. \u201cA lot of places I\u2019d get maybe a second interview and then they\u2019d be like, \u2018Yeah, we\u2019re not doing this anymore.\u2019\u201d Financial losses caused by COVID-19 led to the elimination of many internship roles. For college students or recent graduates looking to find employment in sports, this time isn\u2019t a complete loss, though. It\u2019s a good time to brush up their portfolios and resumes while finding creative ways to stay engaged in the industry, according to Anna Katherine Clay, an accomplished freelance sports writer and adjunct professor in UVa\u2019s department of media studies. Whych recently created a website that hosts clips of his work, whether it\u2019s graphic design work, writing or video footage. He knows that even if the internship search comes up empty, he can still find some positives to set him up for success heading into his graduation next spring. One of the better ways to stay engaged in the sports world is through networking. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t hurt to just reach out and see if someone will have coffee with you,\u201d Clay said. \u201cI feel like the sports world is such a world of connections, like the number of people whose paths I cross or intersect, you know, once every few years, it\u2019s just amazing.\u201d Usually, employees in the sports world are swamped with work. With sports on hold, many of these employees find themselves available to speak with students or recent graduates interested in working in sports. \u201cI\u2019m not really stressed out about the situation because of how well I\u2019m getting responses back from networking with people,\u201d Matthews said. \u201cSo when jobs open up, I feel pretty confident that I\u2019ll be able to get interviews and entry level jobs.\u201d Matthews also is taking part in a summer session for Must Love Sports, an organization founded by UVa alumna Raleigh Anne Gray. The organization, founded in 2017, typically helps connect people within the sports industry in hopes of fostering collaboration within sports. This summer, it\u2019s hosting a virtual summer session with displaced interns. They\u2019ll have the opportunity to work with organizations like NASCAR to develop projects virtually with other interns. The program will also have guest speakers to help interns learn more about working in sports. Tori Gray, who will attend VCU to pursue a master\u2019s degree in sport leadership in the fall, originally planned to take the summer off. Instead, she applied to the Must Love Sports internship and will take part in the program that runs from June 1 through Aug. 7. \u201cI think being able to stay in the loop and in the realm of sports is more important than anything right now,\u201d Gray said. Graduate school gives Gray a clear-cut next step after working with Must Love Sports. Nick Grossman, who interned for The Sabre last year and also has worked for the Charlottesville Tom Sox, will attend Georgetown in the fall as part of the school\u2019s sports industry management program. He\u2019s planning on working remotely for a website covering Cleveland sports this summer before working through the Georgetown program at night during the fall. \u201cIt\u2019s tough right now, so it\u2019s nice to know that I\u2019m going back to school,\u201d Grossman said. \u201cThat\u2019s something that\u2019s a certainty. It\u2019s nice to have this. There are so many uncertainties with sports right now.\u201d In addition to networking, additional schooling and virtual internship programs, the summer gives students a break. They can take time to assess if they truly want to go into sports while also giving themselves a mental break from the constant grind of school or jobs. For David Argo, an incoming freshman at UVa, he\u2019s excited for a lighter summer. Typically, Argo works long days as the head of content for the Charlottesville Tom Sox. He\u2019s eager to take a tiny break, although he\u2019s still producing content for the Tom Sox this summer. \u201cJust trying to lay back a little bit,\u201d Argo said. \u201cI don\u2019t normally have any time to relax. It\u2019s like 12 hours day in, day out, which I like. I need to work just to feel good, but it\u2019s good to take a step back every once and a while.\u201d COVID-19 took athletes and coaches off the field. Seasons were ended, including the seasons of programs like Virginia men\u2019s basketball, which was on the verge of postseason games. The virus and subsequent postponement of sports also impacted UVa students seeking employment in the sports world. Even with the upheaval and changes brought on by the coronavirus, several UVa students remain determined to work in the sports industry. They face additional challenges, but eventually, professional and collegiate teams will return to competition. That return should bring with it the creation of jobs within the industry. \u201cI tell the students, \u2018If this is your dream and you can\u2019t find anything right now that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t do it in a year or two when hopefully some type of sports has returned,\u2019 which we\u2019re already seeing inklings of,\u201d Clay said. Despite a lack of sports, students like Grossman are still set on chasing down their dream of working in the sports industry. \u201cIt definitely hasn\u2019t deterred me,\u201d Grossman said. \u201cI\u2019d say it\u2019s confirmed my love and passion for sports that I\u2019ve always known was there but just without having them and [seeing] how much I miss watching them as a fan, how much I miss covering them as a journalist just kind of confirms everything that I\u2019ve thought along the way. I don\u2019t want to know a world or a life or a job without sports.\u201d","399":"Hall\u2019s deal lasts four years and is worth $3.6 million. Hall becomes the first Jets draft pick from the 2020 NFL Draft to sign his rookie contract. He\u2019s also the first of UVa\u2019s two draft picks to sign a contract. Joe Reed of the Los Angeles Chargers has yet to sign his rookie deal. In four seasons at Virginia, Hall amassed 154 tackles, including 9.5 tackles for loss, and four sacks. He also intercepted five passes and defended another 44 passes, including 24 in 2018. A season-ending leg injury cut Hall\u2019s senior season short, but he finished 2019 with 20 tackles and four passes defended in six games. Hall was the top corner on UVa\u2019s roster, and the Cavaliers\u2019 secondary took a noticeable step back with him out in the final half of the season. The injury hurt Hall\u2019s draft stock, pushing him to the fifth round of the 2020 NFL Draft. Despite sliding in the draft, Hall finds himself in a good position. The Jets need help at cornerback, and Hall will be given chances to earn a starting spot at the position, even if they ease him back to help during the 2020 NFL season. New York\u2019s preseason schedule begins on Aug. 13 in a matchup with the New York Giants. The regular season begins on Sept. 13 in a road matchup against the Buffalo Bills. It\u2019s unclear if COVID-19 will delay any of those contests.","400":"Despite the unfortunate circumstances and consequences brought by the virus, which extend far beyond any athletic field, the Virginia football program is finding silver linings amid the uncertainty. Those start with daily team meetings. \u201cThey\u2019re working out, and we\u2019re doing film study every single morning,\u201d Virginia co-defensive coordinator Kelly Poppinga said. \u201cThis is actually more than what we\u2019ve ever done in the month of May and June. Usually, when players get done with finals we don\u2019t talk to them for six weeks until they come back in mid-June for the summer semester, so we\u2019re getting more communication done with them now than we ever have in the past.\u201d Poppinga admitted that missing spring practice makes an impact, but the Cavaliers aren\u2019t alone in missing spring practices. Programs across the country missed either all of their spring practices or a portion of their spring practice due to COVID-19. UVa coaches enjoy the time meeting with players as a team before breaking into position group discussions. Usually, coaches aren\u2019t in contact with players at this time of year. \u201cThe highlight of each day is seeing my team online and having some interaction with them for the first couple hours of every day,\u201d UVa head coach Bronco Mendenhall said. Given the stress brought about by COVID-19, the Cavaliers relish the time spent together as a group. Even though it\u2019s not in-person interaction, the team spends time together virtually, discussing football and checking in on each other. Using Zoom to communicate also has helped UVa in recruiting. The Cavaliers developed virtual recruiting material to share with prospective student-athletes. The materials appear to work. The Cavaliers have added roughly 10 prospects to its 2021 class as well as a few recruits since the end of March. \u201cI think the main thing that we\u2019ve taken away from this is that we should\u2019ve been using Zoom a long time ago, honestly,\u201d Poppinga said. \u201cWe should\u2019ve been using this technology with kids that maybe have not had the opportunity or would not have the opportunity to come out to Virginia.\u201d Poppinga says the virtual recruiting material helps players across the country learn more about UVa and the program without ever needing to travel to grounds. Theoretically, the Cavaliers could host virtual visits for West Coast players or recruits with a busy schedule wanting to learn more about UVa while also being stressed for time. If the recruit likes what he sees virtually, he may then schedule an in-person visit. Even when some semblance of normalcy returns to the college football landscape, UVa may very well still use Zoom as a part of its recruiting efforts. Outside of football, COVID-19 also sends UVa\u2019s coaches home. Usually, the staff works within offices on grounds. Instead, they\u2019re working from home and participating in virtual calls. This gives the staff more time with their respective families. For Mendenhall, that means calf roping at his ranch. \u201cI\u2019ve been out in my arena roping with my boys every night,\u201d Mendenhall said. \u201cIt\u2019s usually about 6:30-8. I\u2019ve had more practice for team roping than I\u2019ve had in my entire life.\u201d Jason Beck, UVa\u2019s quarterbacks coach, has spent much of his free time hanging out with his three kids and wife, Jaime. Beck says he tries to find a nice balance between work and play with the kids, although his definition of play might vary from his kids\u2019 definition. \u201cI like to try to get out and work with them a little bit and then do something fun,\u201d Beck said. \u201cSo they would not say this is fun, but it\u2019s been fun for me, I try to get them all to go out with me and do a little yard work.\u201d In addition to yard work, the family plays family soccer and football games. It\u2019s a tough challenge for the kids, as both their parents are accomplished athletes. Jason played quarterback at BYU, and Jaime was an All-American soccer player at the same institution. \u201cIt sounds like today\u2019s going to be football,\u201d Beck said on a Zoom call last Thursday. \u201cThere\u2019s already been a few requests to have a family football game. One of the kids is walking around with his bike helmet strapped on because he likes to wear that for the football games.\u201d Between morning meetings with players, improved recruiting tactics and additional family time, not all of the repercussions of canceled in-person athletic activity turned out to be negative.","401":"The Collegiate Baseball Newspaper named Virginia centerfielder Chris Newell the co-Freshman of the Year on Tuesday. Newell was one of four players nationally to win the award, joining Connor Prielipp of Alabama, Christian MacLeod of Mississippi State and John Rhodes of Kentucky as co-Freshman of the Year. Newell is the first UVa player to be recognized as the National Freshman of the Year. A week ago, Newell earned second team All-American honors from Collegiate Baseball Newspaper. He\u2019s the first UVa freshman to earn All-American honors since Danny Hultzen in 2009. Hultzen is currently a member of the Chicago Cubs organization. Newell hit .407 in his first season at UVa, which was cut short after just 18 games due to COVID-19. He hit nearly .500 over the final 13 games of the year and was tied for the team lead with four home runs this season. He knocked in 20 runs and stole eight bases. Max Cotier also made Collegiate Baseball Newspaper\u2019s freshman All-American team. Cotier hit .338 in the shortened 2020 season. He smacked an ACC-high four triples on the season while also contributing three doubles and a homer. He drove in 15 runs in his first season in Charlottesville. Despite a shortened first season, both Cotier and Newell made major impacts as freshmen at the collegiate level.","402":"The Virginia men\u2019s basketball team will be part of the first Basketball Hall of Fame Shootout this fall. The Cavaliers will face Temple on Nov. 13 as part of the one-day event featuring three consecutive games at Charlotte\u2019s Spectrum Center. UVa agreed last summer to play against Tennessee, according to public records obtained by The Daily Progress, but at some point the opponent was switched to Temple. UVa is going to be paid $140,000 for participating in the event. \u201cWe are excited to play Temple in the Hall of Fame Shootout,\u201d Virginia head coach Tony Bennett said in a statement. \u201cIt\u2019s always rewarding to play against a quality nonconference opponent early in the season.\u201d In the 2019-20 season, Temple went 14-17 and finished 6-12 in the American Athletic Conference. The Owls dropped their last five games of the season in their first year under head coach Aaron McKie. Virginia went 23-7 and 15-5 in the ACC in 2019-20. The Cavaliers won eight games in a row prior to the season\u2019s cancellation due to COVID-19. \u201cWe look forward to taking part in the Hall of Fame Shootout this year and playing a high-level opponent in Virginia,\u201d McKie said in a statement. \u201cBeing part of this college basketball tripleheader in Charlotte is one of the highlights of our nonconference season.\u201d The other games in the Friday event include a matchup between Virginia Tech and Davidson as well as a game between East Carolina and Liberty. The game times as well as ticket and television information have yet to be announced. The matchup in Charlotte will likely be UVa\u2019s second game of the season. The Cavaliers have a Nov. 10 game scheduled against Gardner-Webb. Nov. 13 marks a big sports day in North Carolina for the Wahoos. The UVa football program plays at Duke the same day. Given the shortened 2019-20 season, UVa will enter the 2020-21 season as the reigning national champion.","403":"The Virginia men\u2019s lacrosse team entered the 2020 season as the reigning national champion. Given the season\u2019s cancellation due to COVID-19, the Cavaliers also will enter the 2021 season as the reigning national champion. Lars Tiffany\u2019s team will enter next season without star attacker Michael Kraus. The senior opted not to return to school for an additional year of eligibility. Instead, he\u2019ll continue his lacrosse career with the Connecticut Hammerheads, a Major League Lacrosse organization. With Kraus leaving, Virginia expects only two of its seniors from 2020 to return in 2021. Jared Conners, a defenseman, will return. Dox Aitken, who plans on playing football at Villanova in the fall before returning to UVa in the spring, also is expected to return. Conners adds important depth and talent as one of the best defenders in the country. He earned first team All-American honors from Inside Lacrosse in 2020. He also was awarded All-American honors by multiple publications in 2019. His return ensures a steady veteran defensive presence to pair nicely with experienced goalkeeper Alex Rode. Aitken\u2019s return is an interesting one. UVa\u2019s compliance office found an NCAA rule that allows a player to play four years at a school, go to another and still return to the first university. This means Aitken can take advantage of eligibility relief granted by the NCAA and play football at Villanova before returning to Virginia in the spring. \u201cIt\u2019s a 20-year-old statute,\u201d Tiffany said. \u201cNot sure why it\u2019s in there, but we\u2019re happy our compliance office found it. It allows Dox to pursue his passion. He really wants to play football. He wants to measure himself in a different sport, and he really wants to come back to UVa and play a fifth year. Now he has a chance to do that.\u201d Assuming the college football season begins on time, Villanova will enter 2020 as one of the best FCS teams in the nation. Several well-respected FCS rankings list the Wildcats as a top-10 team entering 2020. Villanova faces the ACC\u2019s Wake Forest on Sept. 19, giving Aitken one shot to compete against an FBS program as well. UVa\u2019s other seniors \u2014 Luke Brugel, Theo Dol, Mitch Gordon, Ryan Lamb, Wade Maloney, Justin Schwenk and Griffin Thompson \u2014 will move onto the next phase of their lives outside of the collegiate lacrosse world. \u201cWhen they all said goodbye in mid-March, when they all left the locker room, I had this hope and belief that we would be back together, that everyone\u2019s going to receive an extra year of eligibility and we\u2019ll just pick up where we left off,\u201d Tiffany said. \u201cThen, that was obviously very wrong. I started realizing that for most of our fourth-years, the men who were about to graduate, they had plans. They were ready to move on.\u201d One of the challenges for those seniors was trying to come up with a legitimate academic reason or path to return to UVa in 2021 with about two months to do so. For many, it made more sense to forego the additional year of eligibility. \u201cMost of them were excited about their next plan, so most of them aren\u2019t returning,\u201d Tiffany said. Tiffany called up the players individually as he learned of their plans to graduate and move into professional endeavors and said goodbye. UVa\u2019s head coach loses a handful of seniors, including Kraus, but he does add a talented transfer from Merrimack in Charlie Bertrand. The lefty attacker will help fill the role vacated by Kraus. Bertrand is a graduate transfer, making him immediately eligible for the Wahoos. Players in the transfer portal stood out to UVa and there was mutual interest, but given the Cavaliers\u2019 wealth of returning experience and talented underclassmen, they opted to only bring Bertrand into the mix. \u201cFor other programs, maybe it made sense to bring in four or five transfers,\u201d Tiffany said. \u201cBut for the University of Virginia, with how tight knit of a culture we have, how strong of leadership we have and the talent which resides here in our roster in Charlottesville, this was the right way to go about it for us.\u201d There\u2019s no replacing Kraus, and the Cavaliers would\u2019ve loved to finish their 2020 season with him in the mix, but adding Bertrand gives Virginia an additional weapon in 2021. Add in the planned return of Aitken and Conners, and the reigning national champions should be one of the top teams in the country in 2021.","404":"Being a head coach presents challenges on a daily basis. Typically, coaches foster some type of routine within a Division I athletic program to help alleviate some challenges. Coaching amid COVID-19 is a new challenge, with routines being tossed aside and coaches having to adjust on the fly. \u201cThere have been moments where I feel like I needed a 1-800 number for coaching anonymous,\u201d Virginia men\u2019s lacrosse head coach Lars Tiffany said. \u201cYou know, \u2018Hi, my name is Lars. I\u2019m a head coach, and I\u2019m feeling powerless.\u2019 We all feel the same way. I don\u2019t know how to do my job right now.\u201d Tiffany meant his comments jokingly, but there\u2019s truth within his point. It\u2019s hard to know how to best lead a team through a global pandemic, and many coaches approach the situation differently. The UVa men\u2019s lacrosse team meets virtually on a regular basis, but Tiffany doesn\u2019t have the Cavaliers taking full advantage of the eight hours of meeting time a week allotted to each NCAA Division I program. Other programs take advantage of every possible second of meeting time. In a time usually spent competing in games and preparing for individual games, Tiffany deemed it unnecessary and repetitive to pour through endless hours of film. \u201cIt didn\u2019t feel fruitful filling up our time with the men with endless Zoom calls, reviewing schemes and strategies when we would simply be playing the game for the last couple months of the season,\u201d Tiffany said. \u201cWhat I mean by that is we spend the nontraditional season \u2014 the fall, as a spring sport \u2014 putting in systems and schemes, ensuring comprehension, developing skillsets of the individual player, making them a better shooter, dodger, defender. We refine in the first months or two of the spring, and one we get into mid-March, late March, it\u2019s really just game time.\u201d Tiffany\u2019s program, which won the 2019 national championship, put together a solid fall. The Cavaliers felt confident in the work they did during the fall in preparation for the 2020 season. Despite the occasional hiccups \u2014 UVa went 4-2 in 2020 \u2014 the Cavaliers looked the part of a top-tier team. The roster was loaded with talent, and the team still had most of the year left to find its identity before the postseason. Instead, COVID-19 caused the cancellation of the season, which has the Cavaliers scattered across the country meeting virtually. Given the disappointment of a shortened season and the preparation done by the team in the fall, Tiffany didn\u2019t think it was worth spending eight hours a week as a team looking through old film in May. To make the few hours of film study the team did more enjoyable, Tiffany took UVa out of the equation. \u201cWe watched some game film of some games not involving UVa,\u201d Tiffany said. \u201cI really enjoyed that. For example, 2019 first round playoff game Maryland-Towson to allow the team to watch not for their own personal development but more as coordinator, thinking as a coach development.\u201d The Cavaliers watched the games with Tiffany asking the players why each team would make certain decisions. The group analyzed the strategy of both sides to improve their understanding of why UVa may make certain decisions during games. Going through the spring watching old game film provided valuable insights for the team, but there\u2019s no making up for the lost season. Tiffany said it was challenging to feel motivated during those months when the season was going on. He turned his attention to housework with the season done. \u201cI split a lot of firewood,\u201d Tiffany said. \u201cI did a lot of transplanting of bushes. Some lived, actually \u2026 I really gave this 60-year-old house a lot of love and attention that it\u2019s needed.\u201d While there\u2019s no bringing the season back, Tiffany felt rejuvenated once Memorial Day passed. The weekend usually brings with it the national championship game. The passing of the scheduled title game signaled a more normal offseason. That gave Tiffany an added pep to his step. Prior to that, however, Tiffany took an approach most Division I coaches usually don\u2019t \u2014 he let his team relax and kept Zoom meetings to a minimum. \u201cWho knows what the best process was,\u201d Tiffany laughed. \u201cWhoever wins the championship next year, well, whatever they did, that was right.\u201d","405":"Nick Bitsko, a Virginia baseball signee, was selected by the Tampa Bay Rays with the No. 24 pick in the first round of the 2020 MLB Draft. Bitsko, originally a member of the 2021 high school class, reclassified to become draft eligible in 2020. Bitsko will decide between heading straight to the professional ranks or bypassing the Rays\u2019 offer and attending UVa for the 2021 season. Given the cancellation of the high school season due to COVID-19, scouts didn\u2019t have a chance to see the talented pitcher recently, but stellar workout data and previous success had MLB teams lining up for a shot to add Bitsko. The ESPN draft broadcast mentioned Bitsko\u2019s recent use of video to help entice scouts. He\u2019s used different data and video from his workouts to keep his draft stock high despite not actually playing in games during the spring. The right-handed pitcher possesses tremendous size for someone his age. He stands at about 6-feet-4-inches tall and weighs around 220 pounds. He uses his size to overpower opponents with a dominant fastball. Bitsko routinely throws in the 95-97 mph range, while also featuring solid off-speed pitches. He throws a curveball and a changeup. With a fastball clocking out close to 100 mph and an arsenal of different pitches, scouts love the upside of the 17-year-old. Some experts even compare Bitsko\u2019s ceiling to that of Justin Verlander. He\u2019s also showcased athleticism as a hitter during his high school days. The raw talent, coupled with Bitsko\u2019s size and work ethic, make him one of the best MLB prospects in the country.","406":"Bronco Mendenhall wants to win football games. Make no mistake, UVa football\u2019s head coach expects excellence on the field. Off the field, Mendenhall wants to see his players representing UVa in an honorable fashion. Through community involvement and academic achievement, Mendenhall encourages his players to be much more than athletes. No player meets that expectation as well as senior linebacker Charles Snowden. Standing 6-feet-7-inches tall and weighing 235 pounds, Snowden possesses a blend of speed, size and length that makes NFL scouts drool. He finished the 2019 season with 72 tackles, including 11 tackles for loss and five sacks. Long arms aren\u2019t just good for tackling \u2014 he\u2019s broken up 15 passes in the past two seasons. A menace in passing lanes and a disruptor in the backfield, Snowden has started in all 27 of Virginia\u2019s games in the past two seasons. Athlon Sports named him a preseason second team All-ACC player entering the 2020 season. He\u2019s a star on the gridiron. \u201cTalking to an NFL scout last week, I told him I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve been around a player that has as much energy as Charles,\u201d co-defensive coordinator Kelly Poppinga said in late May. \u201cEvery single day Charles shows up, pumping the arms up, hyped up. It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s a run, if it\u2019s a lift, if it\u2019s a practice. Charles is always bringing that energy and trying to be contagious with it.\u201d Snowden brings the on-field energy in bunches. Given his commitment on the field and his engagment off it, Snowden earns the respect of his peers. When the massive linebacker speaks, players listen. \u201cYou walk into a room and that guy, man, he fills up the room,\u201d Poppinga said. \u201cHis personality, his character, the presence that he has, the way that he talks \u2014 he kind of has this booming voice \u2014 kind of carries through the room, so people listen to him when he talks.\u201d Bronco Mendenhall singled out Snowden and wide receiver Terrell Jana as two players stepping up virtually as the Cavaliers try to navigate an offseason amid COVID-19. Even without the opportunity to lift in groups or meet in-person to discuss scheme, Snowden stands out. \u201cThose two are exemplary in how they\u2019re leading, and I\u2019m impressed,\u201d Mendenhall said. Snowden\u2019s impact extends beyond the football field, though. In recent weeks following George Floyd\u2019s death, Snowden has traveled from his Maryland home to Washington D.C. on a handful of occasions to protest racial injustice. He\u2019s vocal in his support of the Black Lives Matter movement, and he\u2019s willing to use his platform \u2013 he has a few thousand followers on various social media platforms \u2013 to speak out. \u201cMy parents raised me to know right from wrong, and I\u2019ll stand up for what I believe is right, and I\u2019ll speak on it,\u201d Snowden said. \u201cI\u2019m not one to hold my tongue.\u201d Sharing photos of him at protests led to plenty of media opportunities for Snowden to further use his platform to spread the word about why he\u2019s protesting. He made a radio appearance on ESPN Richmond, and he\u2019s spoken to several local news outlets in the past few weeks. It\u2019s hard to follow UVa football and not hear about Snowden protesting racial injustice in the nation\u2019s capital. Snowden also spent roughly 10 minutes on the ACC Network\u2019s \u201cPacker and Durham,\u201d sharing his message to a sizable television audience. \u201cI\u2019ve been given this platform, and I just feel like I needed to do something with it to bring some good, some changes,\u201d Snowden said. During the time away from grounds due to COVID-19, the linebacker came up with the idea for a social media campaign called \u201c\u2018Hoos your Hero.\u201d Snowden and other Virginia athletes share photos of their respective jerseys. On the back, where their name would usually go, they\u2019ve taped over their own name and written the name of a healthcare worker helping out amid COVID-19. Snowden, who calls medical personnel \u201cthe real heroes,\u201d wanted to give credit to front line workers putting their own health at risk to help care for sick patients. Snowden\u2019s hero is Beth Frackleton, a medical professional within the UVa health system that helps patients manage chronic health. The two speak frequently, as Snowden aims to use his infectious energy to bring some added positivity to Frackleton\u2019s day. From his description, he also benefits plenty from the chance to chat with Frackleton. \u201cHer and I talk all the time now, and she\u2019s just one of the nicest, sweetest people I\u2019ve ever met,\u201d Snowden said. \u201cI can tell, like it really just turned her mood around. The fact that I was able to help her makes it all worth it.\u201d \u2018Hoos Your Hero engaged plenty of other UVa athletes, including some in sports other than football. Without Snowden\u2019s idea, which he brought to the athletic department in April before launching in May, the recognition for those healthcare professionals may not have occurred. A video of Snowden and others thanking healthcare heroes even made its way onto UVa social media channels. The linebacker spearheaded the effort, reaching out to those he wanted to be in the video and assuring everything was taken care of before Virginia shared it on its social media channels. \u201cIt\u2019s incredible,\u201d Kevin Thurman, UVa\u2019s director of marketing and a social media strategist, said. \u201cIt\u2019s completely invaluable, and I mean, Charles Snowden is the perfect embodiment of a student and athlete at the University of Virginia. What he brings in the classroom, in the community especially and on the field is second to none.\u201d Snowden believes that his platform, which has grown given his on-field production in recent seasons, affords him the opportunity to impact others. He wants to make sure that platform is put to good use. \u201cI\u2019ve been blessed and fortunate to be put in this position where I can just make change for the good and just touch people\u2019s lives,\u201d Snowden said. Despite not taking the field in months, Snowden is making his presence felt in a variety of ways. From being a leader virtually to protesting racial injustice to supporting healthcare workers, Charles Snowden is much more than a talented linebacker with NFL aspirations. \u201cHe\u2019s amazing,\u201d Mendenhall said.","407":"Colleen Norair won four VISAA Division II state field hockey championships during her high school career at Fredericksburg Academy. She hopes to find similar success as a coach. Norair is the new field hockey coach at Covenant, a program that is accustomed to competing for championships. The recent University of Virginia graduate is no stranger to Covenant after competing against the Eagles in field hockey and lacrosse in high school. That familiarity made Covenant an attractive option for Norair to begin her coaching career. \u201cRegardless of the sport, these games were always super competitive and fun to play in, so when I heard about the Covenant position being open, I was really excited to apply,\u201d Norair said. \u201cI knew they had a good team and came from a school that I had grown up around and respected, not only for their athletic prowess, but I also knew in general was great and that I could expect a close-knit and supportive community.\u201d Norair\u2019s credentials as a player speak for themselves. A two-time VISAA Division II Player of the Year, she led the Falcons to four straight state titles from 2012-15 before signing to play at Virginia. She finished her high school career as Fredericksburg Academy all-time leader in goals (117) and assists (47). Collegiately, Norair was a jack-of-all-trades for the Cavaliers, playing numerous roles during her time in Charlottesville. She started 23 games for UVa, including 14 as a senior defensive midfielder, and finished with six goals and two assists. She also was a two-time ACC Academic Honor Roll recipient. \u201cWhile I was at UVa, I kind of played every position on the field, except for goalie, which really helped me as a student of the game,\u201d Norair said. Part of being a student of the game was watching film and learning opponents\u2019 tendencies, which should serve Norair well at Covenant. \u201cOne of my strengths throughout my playing career has been what I call hockey IQ,\u201d Norair said. \u201cI\u2019ve always loved watching film in order to see other teams\u2019 habits and my own habits, so that I could learn from them and adjust my game in order to maximize the team\u2019s chances of winning. Being exposed to every position on the field helped me to see the connections between the lines and create connections among them. This connection is one of the key things that I learned along the way because a team that can create a seamless transition between lines can control counterattacks and really control the speed of the game.\u201d Norair credits one of her former UVa teammates, Lizzy Shim, for encouraging her to pursue the job at Covenant. The two played against one another in high school and Shim\u2019s sister, Abi, is a rising junior with the Eagles. She talked with the Shim family about the position and decided to pursue the job. \u201cThat definitely helped me realize that this would be a perfect fit for me,\u201d Norair said. \u201cHaving the support of parents, as well as players, really allows for things to run smoothly.\u201d During her time in Charlottesville, Norair has coached several of Covenant\u2019s players in the offseason. She coached at the USA Field Hockey Futures Level at UVa, where she was put in charge of the U14-U19 elite players. Norair also worked multiple UVa camps, including serving as co-director last fall, as well as the local Focus Camp, where she met a few Covenant players. \u201cI think my coaching style really reflects the way that I was a player,\u201d Norair said. \u201cI was never a flashy player. I wasn\u2019t looking for any kind of glory, but you could always expect that no matter what, I was going to give 100 percent and I was going to work as hard as I could to try and win. My coaching style reflects that hard work mentality.\u201d During camps, Norair said she always told her players to not be afraid to make mistakes. In fact, she expected them. Her main focus was how the athletes responded and learned from the error. \u201cI think that how a player reacts to a mistake on the field really tells you a lot about them as an athlete,\u201d Norair said. \u201cThe athlete that shakes it off and continues to play is the player who is going to grow the most.\u201d \u201cMy experience with coaching, I believe, made me a better player and coach along the way. Having both perspectives, coach and player, allowed me to adjust how I receive instructions and feedback and how I give instruction and feedback. I think that it\u2019s really valuable to know and understand that each player is different and therefore how they receive feedback should be different.\u201d Norair said her coaching style is simple. \u201cMy main philosophy with coaching is that basic skills win games,\u201d she said. \u201cA team that can execute basic skills well is a team that can beat anyone. I\u2019m a firm believer that people play their best when they\u2019re having fun, so I hope that translates into our season.\u201d The new Covenant coach said players can expect a lot of energy and fun when they take the pitch. \u201cI\u2019m expecting the program to grow and to really hone in on their basic skills and teamwork,\u201d Norair said. \u201cI know that Covenant has extremely talented players and athletes and I\u2019m excited for them to learn from me and for me to learn from them. I think that we will grow together and I\u2019m excited for that opportunity.\u201d Norair said the support provided by the Covenant athletics department and administration has been overwhelming. While she hasn\u2019t had an opportunity to address the players a team because of COVID-19, she\u2019s looking forward to that opportunity. \u201cEveryone who I met, both players and staff members, have been extremely welcoming and enthusiastic,\u201d she said. \u201cThe players who I have already coached are all extremely eager to learn and open to being coached and I love that and I\u2019m really encouraged by that determination and excitement.\u201d As for goals this season, Norair can\u2019t wait to get started. \u201cI want to win and I\u2019m going to do everything in my power to help coach the team to victory,\u201d she said. \u201cHowever, winning isn\u2019t everything and at the end of the day, growing and learning is equally important. My goal for the program is to elevate an already great team to the next level and long term. \u201cI know this team can win a state title.\u201d","408":"Sara O\u2019Leary\u2019s 2019-20 Virginia women\u2019s tennis team was the smallest team she\u2019s coached. Despite a roster totaling eight, the Cavaliers were a force before COVID-19 ended their season. Led by star freshman Natasha Subhash and a trio of seniors, the Cavaliers took down then-No. 3 N.C. State and five other ranked teams during the season. UVa went 10-5 overall with every loss coming against a ranked opponent. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely a really tough moment,\u201d O\u2019Leary said of learning the season was over. \u201cI don\u2019t think there was a dry eye in the room when the news broke, but what we did is we just had dinner that night and celebrated the season and celebrated each other, especially our seniors who that was their final match.\u201d The ending stung, but there were positives for the Cavaliers to build on entering the 2020-21 season. Last season\u2019s results A 10-5 overall record doesn\u2019t show quite how close the Cavaliers were to the top of college tennis. The Cavaliers lost 4-2 to both Georgia and Pepperdine, both of which were in the top 6 when UVa played them. Virginia also lost 4-3 to Georgia Tech and Florida State, both top 15 teams when the Cavaliers faced them. The team\u2019s only other loss was a 6-1 defeat to No. 1 North Carolina. Virginia found itself in positions to beat programs like Florida State and Georgia Tech, only to fall a bit short. Aside from the North Carolina match, the Cavaliers had chances to win in nearly every match. Subhash, the team\u2019s standout freshman and top singles player, won her singles match in the outing against UNC. The Cavaliers weren\u2019t perfect in 2019-20, but the results showed they would\u2019ve been a tough out in the postseason. Notable departures The team\u2019s three seniors, Hunter Bleser, Camille Favero and Chloe Gullickson, all depart the program. Bleser will head to graduate school at West Virginia, where she\u2019ll play another season, while Favero and Gullickson both have other plans. Losing three seniors is certainly a challenge facing the Cavaliers next season. The on-court challenge weighs on O\u2019Leary\u2019s mind a little bit, but she\u2019s more focused on giving them the proper send-off they deserve that COVID-19 took away. \u201cWe plan to find a weekend that works for all of our three seniors to come back to Charlottesville where we can celebrate them and recognize them and have a banquet like we were planning on doing this spring because we feel strongly that they absolutely deserve that,\u201d O\u2019Leary said. O\u2019Leary hopes to host the seniors for the banquet in the fall, if possible. Notable returners Subhash headlines a talented group of young players. Amber O\u2019Dell and Sofia Munera were both sophomores in 2019-20, and juniors Vivian Glozman and Rosie Johanson add experience to the returning roster. The ITA National Rookie of the Year, Subhash is an elite talent. O\u2019Dell and Munera are both solid singles and doubles players with room to grow. Glozman and Johanson form a fearsome doubles team, and they\u2019re both experienced and successful players. They went 12-2 as a doubles team. O\u2019Leary loses three seniors, but the team\u2019s returning five players bring tremendous talent and experience. Recruiting additions The recruiting additions should excite Virginia sports fans. UVa added the nation\u2019s top recruit in Emma Navarro. Joining Navarro is a top-15 recruit in Hibah Shaikh. The Cavaliers also added Carson Branstine, a transfer from the University of Southern California. At one point, Branstine was the No. 4 ranked junior player in the world. The group of youngsters joins a squad that ended the season ranked 11th by the ITA. With those three additions joining an already talented team, the Cavaliers should find themselves in a great position entering next season. 2020-21 outlook Losing three seniors leaves a mark, but with Subhash and several other young talents leading the way, UVa women\u2019s tennis can add its name to the list of Virginia athletics programs expected to contend for a national title next season. \u201cI think our team can be so great, and I think we can all get along well,\u201d Subhash said. \u201cI\u2019m really excited to see what the season has in store for us.\u201d","409":"\u201cI feel like I\u2019m in a dream,\u201d Kirby told reporters after the game. It\u2019s been five years since Kirby and the Wahoos took down Vanderbilt in the 2015 College World Series championship series. Five years since Brian O\u2019Connor\u2019s team won the first national title in program history. While it might\u2019ve felt like a dream, reminders of the team\u2019s success are scattered throughout the program\u2019s facility. From framed Daily Progress articles to a national champions sign in right field, it\u2019s impossible to forget what Virginia achieved in 2015. The Cavaliers rallied back from a slow start to the season. They used a late-season push to qualify for the ACC Tournament and eventually the NCAA Tournament. Despite a lack of outside expectations, the Cavaliers won the national championships. \u201cInjuries plagued the regular season, but talent \u2014 and heart \u2014 eventually prevailed when it mattered most,\u201d former Daily Progress sportswriter Andrew Ramspacher wrote in 2015. According to O\u2019Connor, the lack of expectations and outside pressure benefited the 2015 squad. With experts expecting Virginia to bow out of the tournament early, the battle-tested Cavaliers rallied together to play some of their best baseball of the season in the most important moments. Virginia didn\u2019t have quite the roster on paper as a team like Vanderbilt, which featured future MLB stars like starting pitcher Walker Buehler, but the Cavaliers played well as a group. UVa played freely. \u201cWhen it got to be championship time, when it got into the NCAA Tournament and that entire run for four weeks, they were a fun group,\u201d O\u2019Connor said. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s because they knew how challenging and difficult the year was and how many obstacles we overcame and they were like, \u2018Hey, let\u2019s go out and enjoy this and enjoy the moment. Let\u2019s see what happens.\u2019\u201d Five years after the accomplishment, O\u2019Connor remembers his team\u2019s perseverance and fun-loving attitude more than anything else. The Cavaliers won critical games on their journey to program history, and they did it while enjoying the process. In previous seasons, O\u2019Connor\u2019s team made the trek to Omaha but came up short. Virginia\u2019s head coach recently watched the team\u2019s 2011 loss to South Carolina that ended the team\u2019s tournament run. \u201cWe were the No. 1 overall national seed in the entire tournament in 2011,\u201d O\u2019Connor said. \u201cWhen that\u2019s the case, there\u2019s a lot of pressure. There is. Our basketball program knows what that\u2019s like.\u201d The Cavaliers feel short amid heightened pressure in 2011. In 2015, O\u2019Connor\u2019s club overcame injuries and losses to scrap its way into the ACC Tournament and the NCAA Tournament. Pressure associated with expectations didn\u2019t exist the same way it did in 2011, and the Cavaliers used the lack of outside influence to make a run to Omaha and eventually to the best-of-3 title series. \u201cWhen you are loose like that, it\u2019s a dangerous team,\u201d O\u2019Connor said. \u201cI\u2019ll remember that about that team. You know, because of what they overcame \u2014 and nobody felt like they had any shot at winning it \u2014 it became a real strength of that team, and it made it a lot of fun.\u201d The 2015 championship didn\u2019t drastically alter Virginia\u2019s program, at least internally. O\u2019Connor still uses the same guiding principles and ideas to lead his team. He wants players to have a great experience at UVa, both in the classroom and on the diamond. O\u2019Connor hopes part of that experience includes a trip to Omaha. The Cavaliers made the College World Series in 2009, 2011, 2014 and 2015. Every player to spend four years within the program starting in 2006 made at least one trip to Omaha. That streak broke with freshmen who started their careers in the spring of 2016. UVa hasn\u2019t been back to Omaha since winning the championship in 2015. COVID-19 ended a promising 2020 campaign, but the Cavaliers should enter the 2021 season as one of the few early-season favorites to make a run to Omaha. The lost season wasn\u2019t all negative, though. The added free time gave O\u2019Connor a chance to watch the 2015 championship-clinching win \u201cmore times in the last three months than ever before.\u201d Five years later, the college baseball world looks different. With increased talent returning due to eligibility relief and a shortened MLB Draft, the 2021 college baseball season could be one of the best in recent memory. The goal for 2021 is the same as it\u2019s been since 2015: get back to Omaha. \u201cIt motivates us every day in recruiting and player development, everything,\u201d O\u2019Connor said. \u201cThese kids come here because they want to have an opportunity to play in Omaha and a chance to win a championship. Hopefully we\u2019ll put ourselves in a position in the near future to have that opportunity again.\u201d","410":"He will expand his role at AHS for the 2020-21 school year after recently being named the school\u2019s new golf coach. \u201cMy No. 1 goal is to build student-athletes that exemplify positive character, sportsmanship, accountability and a process-driven approach,\u201d Lyons said. \u201cI don\u2019t really talk about winning explicitly very much, it\u2019s more about the process. If your process, practice and mental preparation are consistent, then the result of winning will hopefully occur more times than not.\u201d While tennis is his passion, golf has always intrigued Lyons. \u201cI picked up golf late in high school and continued to fit it in around my tennis schedule as much as possible,\u201d Lyons said. \u201cTennis keeps me busy from February through July. When the opportunity became available, I thought it was a perfect opportunity to apply my tennis background to my previous playing experience of golf.\u201d At Albemarle, Lyons has been a teacher and coached girls tennis. He\u2019s attended several golf matches over the past few years and knows some of the players, so his familiarity with the program is strong. Lyons credits AHS athletic director Deb Tyson for believing in him to take over the new position. \u201cThe leadership that Ms. Tyson provides gives you the confidence to take on new challenges, knowing you will be supported every step of the way,\u201d Lyons said. Tennis has always kept Lyons busy. In addition to his time coaching tennis at Albemarle, he\u2019s taught small group and private lessons throughout the Commonwealth, including Fredericksburg Country Club, Massanutten Resort and the UVa summer tennis program. That exposure has allowed him to branch out to do other things. Lyons believes there are a lot of similarities in the two sports. He credits former Albemarle golf coach Greg Maynard for establishing a strong foundation for him to build on. \u201cWhile every coach has their own style, I am attracted to many of the structures that are already in place from Coach Maynard,\u201d he said. \u201cWhile the technique of tennis and golf are different, the individual nature of the game, as well as the practice structure are quite similar.\u201d The Patriots return three key contributors from last year\u2019s squad that captured another Region 5D championship trophy and finished seventh at the VHSL Class 5 golf championship, led by rising sophomore Vivian Hui, senior Mia Liang and junior Michael Wombacher. Lyons expects a strong crop of young talent to join the program this fall. His main focus is to instill the basics. \u201cThe goal for the new players will more than likely be focused on golf etiquette, baseline technique and fostering a love for the game,\u201d he said. \u201cThe returning players will probably focus on mental game and course management. I am excited to develop relationships on how I can best help each student-athlete. If we come together as a team and help push each other forward, one can hope to continue our streak of regional titles.\u201d Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, Lyons has not had a chance to meet all of his players, but looks forward to the opportunity once the VHSL deems it to be safe. \u201cI am hopeful we can have a \u2018normal\u2019 season, but nothing about this experience is normal,\u201d Lyons said. \u201cWhatever the VHSL decides, I am confident that they will put us in the best position for our well-being as well as our student athletes.\u201d Once they resume play, Lyons is excited to help the Albemarle golf program continue to grow. \u201cCoach Maynard left some pretty big shoes to fill, but also left the program with a structure of proven success,\u201d he said. \u201cThe goal is just for consistent improvement, each and every day, not only from our golf, but our attitude and approach to the game.\u201d","411":"After winning the 2019 national championship, the Virginia men\u2019s lacrosse team entered the 2020 season with high expectations. Lars Tiffany\u2019s team returned an abundance of talent at every position. The team was strong offensively, and its defense featured some of the best upperclassmen in the nation. COVID-19 kept Virginia fans from really learning who the 2020 Cavaliers were. Virginia played just six games, winning four and dropping a pair of contests to Ivy League schools. UVa showed flaws, but if the 2019 season taught the Cavaliers anything, it\u2019s that early season results don\u2019t dictate late-season standing. Instead of replicating a late-season surge, the Cavaliers headed home before even playing a conference game. Virginia finds itself in the unusual position of entering the 2021 season as the reigning national champion despite not playing a postseason game in 2020. Luckily for Tiffany and company, the Wahoos possess the pieces to make a run at winning the championship again in 2021. \u201cWe truly believe that we\u2019ve spent three years driving hard, creating a culture, creating a roster that can experience and create championships,\u201d Tiffany said. Last season\u2019s results Virginia took down Loyola, Lehigh, High Point and Air Force for four decent wins. Princeton and Brown got the better of the Cavaliers. Six games is a small sample size, so it\u2019s hard to take too much away from the results. The one noticeable trend through the six-game season was Virginia\u2019s tendency to start fast and finish slowly. UVa led Brown 8-4 before losing 14-13 in its final game of the year. Even in wins early in the season, the Cavaliers jumped out to big leads before fading late. In the season opener against Loyola, UVa led 9-3 at halftime before being outscored 6-3 in the second half. Whether it was the ability to adjust in game or maintain focus for the entire contest, Virginia had room to improve with its finishes. Regardless, the Cavaliers were excellent in the opening minutes of games and not every finish was poor. In a victory over High Point, the Cavaliers entered the fourth quarter tied before outscoring the Panthers 5-2 to win 18-15. Notable departures Despite what\u2019s shaping up to be an elite roster for the 2021 season, the Cavaliers lose the majority of their seniors. Michael Kraus is the most noticeable loss for the Wahoos. Kraus scored 14 goals and added 12 assists in the team\u2019s 2020 season. He spent four years being one of the most consistent and reliable attackers on the Virginia roster. He joined the professional ranks instead of opting for another season in Charlottesville. Kraus leaves a hole at attack. Notable returners Matt Moore and Ian Laviano are two important returners at attack. Alex Rode returns as the team\u2019s goalie. All three of those players should play major roles in 2021. When it comes to 2020 seniors, however, the major returners are Jared Conners and Dox Aitken. Both plan to use eligibility relief to return for the 2021 season. Aitken\u2019s case is a bit unusual. He plans to play football at Villanova \u2014 an FCS program \u2014 for the 2020-21 fall football season before returning to the Cavaliers in the spring. Oddly enough, Aitken\u2019s case is allowed under NCAA rules. Assuming that all goes to plan, the Cavaliers return an elite midfielder in Aitken and one of the country\u2019s best defenders in Conners. Key additions While incoming freshmen will have a hard time breaking into the lineup, the Cavaliers did add Merrimack graduate transfer Charlie Bertrand to the mix. He\u2019s a left-handed attacker who starred at Merrimack. Bertrand is expected to help fill the hole left by Kraus. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to just add to add,\u201d Tiffany said. \u201cIt could be subtraction if it alters what we spent so much time and energy building and creating, so as a staff we were really torn. Do we go to the transfer portal or not?\u201d Virginia\u2019s staff ultimately decided that Bertrand helped fill a hole on the roster while also adding to the locker room dynamic. Tiffany mentioned that other programs might have looked to add four or five transfers, and while Tiffany and the coaching staff spoke to multiple potential transfers, the fit with Bertrand was the best for both parties. When it comes to future recruiting additions, Tiffany expects to make a larger commitment to film study. While he doesn\u2019t show up completely unprepared to watch recruits live, Tiffany believes there\u2019s an opportunity to better study video before heading to high school events. \u201cIf you have a great year, you play into late May and recruiting starts in June, but I think we got to do it,\u201d Tiffany said of increased film study of high school prospects. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to find the time. I can\u2019t just be going out to these events a bit blind.\u201d 2020-21 outlook Jared Conners returning does wonders for the team\u2019s defense. The team\u2019s defense needs to develop a bit around Conners and Rode in goal, but the team should be one of the better defensive teams in the country. Offensively, if Aitken\u2019s plan goes smoothly, expect a dominant attack. Moore and Laviano are both electric attackers, and Bertrand adds yet another element offensively. Players like Connor Shellenberger, just a redshirt freshman, add even more weapons on attack. The Cavaliers are still the defending national champions, and they\u2019ll have as good a shot as any team to win the national title in 2021.","412":"Virginia baseball coach Brian O\u2019Connor was named the state\u2019s Baseball Coach of the Year by the Virginia Association of Sports Information Directors on Wednesday. In addition to O\u2019Connor\u2019s award, Chris Newell won Rookie of the Year honors. In total, seven Cavaliers landed on the VaSID\u2019s All-State teams. Those seven players were Andrew Abbott, Max Cotier, Zack Gelof, Griff McGarry, Logan Michaels, Chris Newell and Stephen Schoch. Michaels landed on the second team, while the other six earned first-team honors. All seven UVa players are expected to return to the Cavaliers next season. Both Michaels and Schoch plan on using eligibility relief granted to spring sport athletes by the NCAA, while the other five athletes still had eligibility remaining initially. The Cavaliers led all Virginia programs with six players named to the first team. Virginia Tech, James Madison and Radford all added two players to the first team. For O\u2019Connor, it\u2019s his 10th VaSID Coach of the Year honor and his first since the Cavaliers won the national championship in 2015. He helped guide the Cavaliers to a 14-4 record in 2020 before COVID-19 caused the cancellation of the rest of the season. Virginia was 2-1 in ACC play. UVa was particularly adept at the plate, finishing tied for seventh nationally in runs per game. The Cavaliers averaged nine runs per contest, which tied N.C. State for the best mark in the ACC. Three of UVa\u2019s seven players named to the VaSID All-State team were pitchers. Abbott and Schoch served as reliable options at the back of Virginia\u2019s bullpen, while McGarry was the team\u2019s Friday starter. Abbott and McGarry were expected to be MLB Draft choices, but they\u2019ll return to Charlottesville after going undrafted in the 2020 draft. With some of the best talent in the commonwealth returning for the 2021 season, Virginia is expected to enter next season as one of the best teams in Division I baseball.","413":"With the college football season approaching, the Virginia football program announced on Friday that it will return to Grounds on July 5. The team will start training camp Aug. 9 in advance of its season opener against Georgia on Sept. 7. The July 5 return date is optional for players. Mandatory workouts begin on July 15. \u201cI\u2019m going to coach the team and do the very best I can in keeping them safe and keeping them well and keeping them growing and progressing in these unique and challenging times, and for our players that aren\u2019t returning, there\u2019s no penalty,\u201d Virginia head coach Bronco Mendenhall said on Packer and Durham. \u201cThey\u2019ll have their scholarships. I\u2019m anxious to continue and develop and navigate this process at the very highest level and try to do what\u2019s right.\u201d Players will have their scholarships honored for the entire academic year, even if they opt not to return to grounds due to COVID-19 concerns. Mendenhall says he thinks it\u2019s debatable if the process for programs returning to workouts needs to begin now, but he also acknowledged the importance of returning soon if a program wants to be prepared for a season starting in September. Based on NCAA guidelines and the upcoming season, the Cavaliers feel the need to start preparing as a group to be physically ready for games in the fall. For the athletes that do return to grounds, they\u2019ll receive COVID-19 education, according to a release from UVa. This includes print and video resources from the CDC and NCAA. Additionally, the UVa health system will test student-athletes and staff for COVID-19. Positive tests will be reported to the Thomas Jefferson Health District or the Virginia Department of Health and results will be given to the program\u2019s team physicians. Based on recent guidelines for a return to play from the NCAA, Virginia will use the following schedule ahead of its Sept. 7 season opener. July 5-14: Voluntary team activity July 15-25: Required activity (eight hours per week) July 26-Aug. 8: Required activity (20 hours per week) Aug. 9: Fall training camp opens For fall training camp, there is a five-day acclimation period followed by the opportunity for 25 on-field practices. Other programs with Sept. 5 opening games can start training camp on Aug. 7, per NCAA guidelines. The Cavaliers will start two days later due to their Monday game against Georgia. UVa\u2019s release also mentions that the athletic program has not yet made a final decision regarding fan attendance. \u201cAs more information regarding seating capacity at Scott Stadium becomes available this summer, it will be communicated to ticket holders and supporters,\u201d the release said.","414":"Instead, as it has done many times before, COVID-19 caused a change of plans. Willoughby\u2019s rookie season will take place at the IMG Academy in Bradenton, Florida. The IMG Academy will house the athletes, while also hosting the games and serving as a spot to practice. Starting in late July, the WNBA is expected to play the entirety of its shortened 22-game regular season and subsequent postseason in Florida to help mitigate the risk of players, coaches and employees contracting the virus during the season. \u201cIt\u2019s so different from what I was excited about after being drafted, just anticipating that first home game in the Barclay\u2019s Center and having so many of my family members and friends supporting me,\u201d Willoughby said. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be the same narrative in that sense, but I think there\u2019s still a lot to be excited about.\u201d There certainly is plenty to be excited about for Willoughby. The rookie intends on playing the 2020 season as other players drop out due to concerns over COVID-19 and racial injustice \u2013 some players will sit out the season to better focus their time on protesting racial injustice and police brutality. Willoughby, however, is looking forward to her first season on the court as a professional. She\u2019s also looking forward to using her platform as a professional athlete in a major sports league to help raise awareness and combat racial injustice. Without having yet played a WNBA game, though, Willoughby is still trying to figure out how she might use that platform in a league she doesn\u2019t know that well yet. \u201cI\u2019m trying to find \u2014 in the midst of everything and especially transitioning to this new level \u2014 what my voice looks like and what my voice sounds like and what action looks like for me,\u201d Willoughby said. \u201cThat\u2019s something I\u2019ve been questioning, but I think I\u2019ve been appreciative of the conversations that my team and even throughout the league that have been had about really taking the momentum of everything that\u2019s going on in this world and continuing with it.\u201d Like most things these days, there\u2019s an element of uncertainty. Willoughby does expect the league and teams to come up with some way to stand against racial injustice; she\u2019s just not quite sure how that will look next month. In the immediate future, Willoughby said Thursday she plans to head to the Liberty team facility in the next few days. In the coming weeks she\u2019ll head to Florida. If everything with the season goes according to plan \u2014 Florida is currently experiencing a large spike in COVID-19 cases \u2014 Willoughby will spend a few months in Florida for the 2020 WNBA season. UVa\u2019s leading scorer in 2019-20 is doing her best to remain in shape. She\u2019s excited to arrive at the team facility and start more formal work. Willoughby is hopeful that she\u2019ll be prepared for any possible situation. Usually, WNBA regular seasons last 34 games. This year\u2019s shortened season played in one city makes for an unusual circumstance. Given her inexperience, Willoughby thinks the odd circumstances could actually benefit her. \u201cI think, more so than veterans possibly, I have the potential to be more adaptive to whatever situation is presented because I don\u2019t know anything different,\u201d Willoughby said. Staying healthy is one of the goals Willoughby holds entering the season. She also wants to win games and learn as much as she can about competing in the league. She won\u2019t be alone in the learning process \u2014 the Liberty feature seven rookies on their roster. It\u2019s a young team loaded with talent entering an unprecedented WNBA season. Due to COVID-19, professional sports are experiencing a new set of circumstances. For Willoughby, that means a strange rookie season waits. \u201cI think it\u2019s definitely been, in terms of preparing for a season, unlike any other that I\u2019ve encountered,\u201d Willoughby said.","415":"As June winds down, we\u2019re roughly two months away from the start of the fall sports season. It\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess as to how the fall will play out with COVID-19 still a very real threat, but as of now, the fall season is set to take place. With games hopefully on the horizon, we changed things up a bit this week and asked for questions from readers. Here are a few of the questions readers want to know ahead of the fall season. Question: When will the Virginia football team return to Charlottesville? Answer: Bronco Mendenhall and the Cavaliers announced Friday that they\u2019ll return to grounds for voluntary workouts on July 5. From July 5-14, the Cavaliers will take part in those workouts. Required activity begins on July 15 and lasts through July 25. The next couple weeks also feature required activity, but the allowed hours of work per week increases from eight hours to 20, according to NCAA guidelines. Fall training camp for the Cavaliers opens Aug. 9 in anticipation of the team\u2019s Sept. 7 season opener against Georgia in Atlanta. With COVID-19 still a concern, players can opt out of returning to grounds at no penalty. Mendenhall will honor scholarships through the entire academic year, even if players decide not to play because of the virus. Q: When will the Virginia men\u2019s basketball team return to Charlottesville? A: There\u2019s no official word on when Tony Bennett and the Cavaliers will get back to work this summer in preparation for the 2020-21 season. The team is allowed to return to grounds per NCAA guidelines, but coaches can\u2019t work with players until required activity is allowed to begin July 20. With that in mind, it\u2019ll likely be a couple weeks until the Virginia men\u2019s basketball team returns to grounds. Given the football team\u2019s impending return, the university feels comfortable bringing athletes back, but there\u2019s less urgency for a winter sport like basketball to return than there is for a fall sport like football. Waiting a couple weeks \u2014 if that\u2019s what the men\u2019s basketball program chooses to do \u2014 also gives the program a chance to learn from how football handles its return. Q: Does UVa have an expected date to say whether or not fall sporting events will have fans at them? A: In Virginia\u2019s latest press release regarding the football team\u2019s return to play, the athletic department said it \u201cis considering various contingency scenarios to accommodate fans.\u201d That could range from events at full capacity to events with no fans allowed. In all likelihood, football games won\u2019t operate at full capacity in the fall. Expect limited crowds at the very least. It\u2019s unclear how fan attendance at Olympic sports will be handled. There\u2019s no exact date for when UVa will announce plans related to crowds, but the athletic department is trying to find a safe solution. Q: Could fall sporting events be canceled? A: The short answer is yes. It\u2019s hard to know how COVID-19 will impact any of the fall seasons, but it\u2019s unlikely that all of the fall seasons will go on without issues. A few Division III programs have canceled fall sports entirely. The Patriot League announced that no teams will fly to competitions this fall, which will result in some scheduling changes for those teams. It\u2019s only June, and fall sport scheduling changes are in the works across the country. Uncertainty remains, but scheduling changes and potential cancellations loom. Q: Do you think UVa is in danger of losing any football recruits due to COVID-19? A: When it comes to the 2020 recruiting class, those players have signed their national letters of intent and plan to play for the Cavaliers. Some players across the country might transfer to schools closer to home, but at this point the Cavaliers\u2019 2020 class seems committed to the Wahoos. While the pandemic could certainly impact the 2021 recruiting class, the Cavaliers have already built up a solid class of recruits. With a COVID-19 vaccine expected in the next 12 months, it\u2019s unlikely the pandemic will dramatically impact the decisions of those verbally committed athletes who wouldn\u2019t take the field until the 2021 season. The recruiting impact of COVID-19 is a bit difficult to predict at this time, but the Cavaliers currently sit in a great spot when it comes to their football recruiting classes.","416":"Hall is familiar with the Thunder. The Virginia Beach native was selected by Oklahoma City in the second round of the 2018 NBA Draft and played in five regular-season games for the Thunder this year before being released from his two-way contract by the team. He also played 30 games for the Oklahoma City Blue, the organization\u2019s G-League affiliate. Hall was particularly effective in those 30 G-League games, averaging 15.6 points, 5.7 rebounds and 4.4 assists per game. The former UVa guard built on a solid four-year career in Charlottesville once turning professional. In four seasons under Tony Bennett, Hall took the floor in 128 games, including 89 starts. He started each of the final 68 games of his Virginia career, which ended after the 2017-18 season. As a substitute player, Hall can be called upon in the event a Thunder player decides not to return for the rest of the season or if a player test positive for COVID-19 or suffers an injury. In all likelihood, the Thunder and other NBA teams hope they won\u2019t have to use substitute players, but Hall serves as a solid depth piece should he be needed. The Thunder currently sit in fifth place in the Western Conference, and they\u2019re solidly in the playoff field. It\u2019s unclear what role Hall will play as a substitute player, but he\u2019s joining a quality team with hopes of making a postseason run. Oklahoma City is scheduled to restart the season on Aug. 1 in a game against the Utah Jazz.","417":"Starting on July 4, 24 teams will compete in a $1 million winner-take-all basketball tournament. Dubbed \u201cThe Basketball Tournament\u201d and also known as \u201cTBT,\u201d the event will be fully quarantined and take place in Ohio. Originally, University of Virginia alumni planned to form a team to compete in the event. It would\u2019ve been the first UVa alumni team to participate in the competition, which began in 2014. Due to COVID-19, the Cavaliers\u2019 squad dropped out at the beginning of the month. \u201cWe just were like, \u2018Let\u2019s just wait and see what happens here,\u2019\u201d Thomas Rogers, a former UVa men\u2019s basketball player who spearheaded the team\u2019s efforts to enter the tournament, said. \u201cThis is our first year, and we wanted to make a good impression on the guys that are playing. We want it to be a good experience for them.\u201d Given the importance of health in this year\u2019s tournament, the TBT experience is much different than other years. Tournament organizers are taking measures to ensure players don\u2019t spread the virus. That means those competing need to take a COVID-19 test a week before their arrival in Ohio. When teams arrive on June 30, everyone is tested again. Team members then quarantine in a hotel before taking another test on July 4. The event begins after that, with only players who tested negative allowed to compete. Players are expected to quarantine and isolate for the duration of the 10-day tournament. \u201cIt\u2019s really like 14 days, completely quarantined with no friends or family in a hotel room by yourself,\u201d Rogers said. \u201cThat just didn\u2019t sound like a really enjoyable experience to me.\u201d Add in one of the team\u2019s marquee players, Akil Mitchell, competing in a league in Israel, and the team would\u2019ve needed to scramble to put together a deep and competitive roster. With only 24 teams being admitted into the field, there was a chance UVa\u2019s squad might not have been selected for the event if their top players couldn\u2019t attend. Being a first-time team in TBT comes as a challenge. Being a first-time team amid the COVID-19 pandemic brings even more obstacles. Originally, Virginia\u2019s team planned on competing in the Washington D.C. region of the event. Before COVID-19 hit, Rogers and company expected big crowds to watch former Wahoos compete for prize money. Roughly $150,000 of the winnings, should UVa\u2019s alumni team had won, would\u2019ve gone to Malcolm Brogdon\u2019s Hoops2o, which is a part of Chris Long\u2019s Waterboys initiative. Rogers wanted to have former UVa players, like Brogdon, involved in the event. Whether it was as an adviser or mentor, the team hoped former players would support the team during the event. That\u2019s much harder when the event is taking place with strict isolation rules. The team\u2019s goal for the event was to generate excitement about UVa basketball during a time when there\u2019s usually no basketball. Instead, the NBA plans to return in late July, giving fans a rare look at competitive basketball deep into the summer. UVa\u2019s alumni team doesn\u2019t view this year\u2019s tournament as a lost cause, though. Missing out on this year\u2019s event means the group just has to wait a year to join the event. Rogers hopes fans will be allowed to watch next year and the tournament will once again return to its 64-team format. Assuming that\u2019s the case, expect the UVa alumni team to make its TBT debut next summer. \u201cI like to play the odds, and the odds are that next year is a 64-team tournament with more of our good players available,\u201d Rogers said. \u201cI like our chances.\u201d","418":"COVID-19 drastically altered the sports world. The NBA shut down its season in March, and it doesn\u2019t anticipate taking the court again until late July. Collegiate sports were halted for the spring season, and those programs are hopeful to compete in the fall. While professional, collegiate and high school sports were all dramatically changed by the virus, one sport has returned to action in the U.S. quicker than many others. The sport almost perfectly designed to withstand COVID-19 restrictions is golf. Given the ability to social distance while playing, some courses across the country never closed. Others opened up after a brief closure. For some members of the University of Virginia men\u2019s and women\u2019s golf teams, the pandemic has offered what feels like an extra offseason to hone their games. \u201cBeing down in North Carolina, all of the golf courses stayed open,\u201d Riley Smyth, a member of the UVa women\u2019s golf team, said. \u201cAlso, we have a little home gym in our garage, so I\u2019ve been able to work out and practice every day basically.\u201d Smyth even competed in the Golfweek Myrtle Beach Collegiate last week, finishing in a tie for 22nd in a field with 41 competitors. Despite shooting a combined 18-over-par in the three-day event, Smyth tallied eight birdies and an eagle over the three rounds. She wanted to use the tournament as a chance to adjust to competitive golf again, which has been just about the only thing lacking from her recent preparation. Even with a lack of summer tournaments on the schedule, Smyth is grateful that her course is open and she\u2019s had a chance to spend months developing her game. Typically, college golfers compete for their teams in the fall and spring, and they use the summers to play in various amateur tournaments. \u201cWe don\u2019t ever really get a time to just practice and work on our games and just really focus on developing mechanics and different kind of shot-making skills,\u201d Smyth said. Basketball players can perform individual drills during this time, which allows for development, but it\u2019s not the same as playing against an opponent or in a team setting. Football players likely haven\u2019t been able to simulate game action against opponents. Golfers, however, can play rounds of golf amid the pandemic. While it\u2019s hard to simulate the feelings of competition, for those who can still access their home courses, the pandemic shouldn\u2019t halt their development. Andrew Orischak, a senior men\u2019s golfer who will use eligibility relief to compete again for the Cavaliers, says he\u2019s used the time to work on his short game and wedge play. The South Carolina native still has access to his home course, and he\u2019s enjoyed the chance to improve weaknesses in his game. \u201cI\u2019ve always enjoyed the development side of golf, so if I can practice and work on weaknesses and try and get them better and see improvement, I find a lot of joy out of that,\u201d Orischak said. \u201cI mean it hasn\u2019t really been tedious for me. I think it\u2019s been a lot of fun.\u201d One of golf\u2019s perks is the game is played in nature, usually in a fairly quiet environment lacking a lot of people. A collegiate golf tournament looks much different than a UVa basketball home game at John Paul Jones Arena. An individual sport played outside, golf finds itself in a unique position to thrive amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Virginia\u2019s golfers hope they can take advantage of the opportunity their sport sees during this unusual time. When they\u2019re able to return to grounds, they\u2019re most looking forward to the chance to compete against other people, which is just about the only thing some players are missing out on at the moment. \u201cEven though it was a great time to get to practice and be home and play, I really miss competing,\u201d Smyth said. \u201cThe competition brings out a different side of my game.\u201d","419":"Zimmerman hinted at this possibility in a recent diary entry he wrote for the The Associated Press. Given the health risks associated with COVID-19, he decided it would be best for him to skip the shortened 2020 season. \u201cAfter a great deal of thought and given my family circumstances \u2014 three young children, including a newborn, and a mother at high risk \u2014 I have decided not to participate in the 2020 season,\u201d Zimmerman wrote in a statement. While Zimmerman himself might not carry additional risk should he contract the virus, the long-term health effects of the virus are still unclear, and he has family members who could suffer greatly if he brings the virus home. The potential health impact on loved ones is something players consider when trying to determine whether to play or sit out the 2020 season. \u201cEveryone knows how much it means to me to be part of a team, and I will miss that camaraderie dearly this year,\u201d Zimmerman said. \u201cOf course I would love to pursue back-to-back titles. I cannot speak for anyone else, but given the unusual nature of the season, this is the best decision for me and my family, and I truly appreciate the organization\u2019s understanding and support.\u201d Joe Ross, another member of the Nationals, also announced his decision to opt out of the 2020 season Monday. \u201cWe are one hundred percent supportive of their decision to not play this year,\u201d Nationals General Manager Mike Rizzo said in a statement. \u201cWe will miss their presence in the clubhouse and their contributions on the field.\u201d Zimmerman has played 1,689 games for the Nationals across his 15-season career. He\u2019s smashed 270 home runs and drove in 1,015 runs. The first and third baseman was in Washington when the Nationals were subpar, and he\u2019s remained around as the Nationals reached the top of the baseball world last fall, winning the World Series. The Nationals icon says the announcement does not signal the end of his career, though. \u201cTo be clear, I am not retiring at this time,\u201d Zimmerman said. \u201cI have not decided on my future in baseball past 2020. But this year, I\u2019ll be staying safe at home and pulling as hard as anyone for the guys to defend our championship.\u201d","420":"COVID-19 led to the cancellation of the 2020 college baseball season, sparking a chain of events that might make the on-field college baseball product in 2021 the best it\u2019s been in years. First, the cancellation of the season led to the NCAA offering spring sport athletes eligibility relief. UVa\u2019s Stephen Schoch, for example, would\u2019ve ended his career in 2020. Instead, Schoch and other seniors across the country can return for another year. Second, Major League Baseball shortened its 2020 draft as a cost-cutting measure given that the league had to cut down the length of its season. This means UVa pitchers Andrew Abbott and Griff McGarry will return to school in 2021 after going undrafted in the 2020 draft despite professional potential. While the canceled season and shortened draft didn\u2019t benefit the players this spring, it should make for highly competitive college baseball games in 2021. \u201cNext year is gonna be really interesting,\u201d Virginia head coach Brian O\u2019Connor said. \u201cMost college baseball teams, they\u2019ll be the best they\u2019ve been in quite some time. I just think it\u2019s going to be so loaded in college baseball because of the ability of everybody to get another year, the impact of the draft, all that kind of stuff. I think it\u2019s gonna be as talented, as fun, as challenging a season that college baseball has ever had.\u201d That\u2019s high praise for the current state of college baseball from O\u2019Connor. He\u2019ll enter his 18th season as the leader of the Cavaliers with a stacked roster to attack talented opponents. UVa returns experienced upperclassmen like catcher Logan Michaels, Schoch, Abbott and McGarry. Youngsters like centerfielder Chris Newell, infielder Max Cotier and pitcher Nate Savino return to join rising juniors Nic Kent and Zack Gelof. There\u2019s depth, hitting, pitching and speed across UVa\u2019s roster. Like many other teams, Virginia is loaded heading into the 2021 season. Graduating pitcher Chesdin Harrington summed it up well when he posted a meme of Squidward, a character from the TV show \u201cSpongeBob SquarePants,\u201d looking longingly out a window as SpongeBob and Patrick played outside. Harrington wrote, \u201cEvan Sperling and I as Squidward watching the entire UVa baseball team run it back next year.\u201d Harrington and Sperling, two pitchers who don\u2019t plan on using eligibility relief to return in 2021, are just about the only guys missing out on what could be a thrilling 2021 college baseball season. On paper, they\u2019re missing a chance to play for a team with realistic hopes of making it to Omaha. O\u2019Connor believes the team\u2019s blend of returning experience \u2014 see Abbott, Michaels and Schoch among other others \u2014 paired with young stars like Newell and Savino, gives UVa a chance to make a postseason run. He knows from experience how challenging it is to make a run in college baseball, though. In fact, O\u2019Connor believes the 2014 Virginia team that fell short in the College World Series finals was probably a more talented team than the 2015 squad that won the national championship. From fortunate bounces to clutch hits to good health, there\u2019s plenty of factors that need to go right for a team to turn potential into a trip to Omaha. Fortunately for the Cavaliers, they have the pieces to be one of the nation\u2019s top teams entering 2021. \u201cWe\u2019ve got almost our entire team back next year,\u201d O\u2019Connor said. \u201cThat is certainly significant. To have a championship caliber team, you have to have talent and experience is a big part of that. That team we had in 2015 had some really high quality experience and veteran guys, but it also had an influx of talented youth. It appears next year is going to have that kind of mix to where we\u2019re going to have some really great experience, but we\u2019ve got an incoming group too that can add to the depth and the talent.\u201d The talent is there for UVa. It\u2019s also there for a host of other teams returning stars they didn\u2019t expect to return. College baseball games will be worth the price of admission in 2021.","421":"Facilities are all the rage in college athletics. Whether it\u2019s a fancy weight room, a team lounge or a new arena or stadium, recruiting becomes easier when coaches can offer top-tier facilities. For the University of Virginia\u2019s men\u2019s and women\u2019s golf programs, the facilities just received a major upgrade. Davis Love III, a 21-time winner on the PGA Tour, and Love Golf Design recently redesigned Birdwood Golf Course at Boar\u2019s Head Resort. The new and improved facility will include an 18-hole course that stretches out to more than 7,000 yards from the tips. There\u2019s also a six-hole par-3 course, a putting course and an updated practice facility. The new Birdwood Golf Course opened to the public Wednesday. While UVa\u2019s teams aren\u2019t in Charlottesville due to COVID-19, the players and coaches are eager to return to grounds to check out the new course and practice area. \u201cTo be honest, it\u2019s really challenging to have this incredible facility that we can\u2019t quite step foot on yet, but we\u2019re really proud that UVa is being very cautious about testing all of our student-athletes for COVID and even staff members before we can get back out there,\u201d Ria Scott, the head coach of UVa\u2019s women\u2019s team, said. Understandably, Virginia plans on gradually bringing athletes back to grounds. When the golf teams return, they\u2019ll compete at one of the better courses in the ACC. \u201cIt\u2019s the best in our conference from what I know and one of the best in the country, so it\u2019s a real game changer for the teams,\u201d Scott said. \u201cOne of the things that I\u2019ve said is I\u2019m so proud of how UVa has been willing to adapt with facility needs, even with Olympic sports.\u201d Bowen Sargent, the head coach of UVa\u2019s men\u2019s golf team, echoed Scott\u2019s thoughts on the new course. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing but a positive, obviously,\u201d Sargent said. \u201cTo put that much money into the golf programs \u2014 in total it\u2019s probably well over $21 million \u2014 when you add a new golf course, a new building, practice short-game area, it\u2019s pretty impressive. Our guys are going to have a lot to work with.\u201d Unlike sports such as basketball or football, the playing field changes week to week for golfers. In basketball, the rims are 10 feet high. In football, the field stretches 100 yards. In golf, each tournament features a different course of varying length and difficulty. Playing a challenging home course with several different practice areas becomes a major advantage. For example, if a player struggles with shots from about 100-125 yards, the six-hole par-3 course can serve as an ideal practice area. Few Division I programs have the luxury of using a facility as nice as UVa\u2019s new course and practice areas. The facility is a bonus that can help both of UVa\u2019s golf programs take a leap from good to great. The men\u2019s team reached the No. 1 ranking nationally, per Golfstat, for the first time in program history in 2017. The group finished a program-best 10th at the NCAA Championships that season. UVa made its 12th consecutive postseason appearance in 2019. On the women\u2019s side, the Cavaliers finished 14th at the NCAAs in Scott\u2019s first season at the helm in 2018-19. UVa finished the year as a top-20 squad. While the results in Scott\u2019s second season were up and down, the Cavaliers return a team loaded with young talent. She\u2019s excited about what the future holds as she aims to build Virginia into a national title threat. Clearly, both programs are good. With the majority of UVa\u2019s athletic programs competing for championships, the men\u2019s and women\u2019s golf programs aim to take a step forward, though. There\u2019s a difference between finishing in the top 15 in the country and moving into the top 5. The improved facilities can help the Cavaliers make that jump. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna have all we need and then some,\u201d men\u2019s golfer Andrew Orischak said. \u201cWe\u2019ll have all the resources we need to get better, and it\u2019s just gonna be a lot of fun going to practice every day.\u201d","422":"When scrolling through social media in late May and early June, there was an influx of posts speaking out against racial injustice. As time passed, the influx of content slowed. For some, their feeds returned to normal in recent weeks. The national news cycle switched some of its attention back to COVID-19, as opposed to racial injustice and police brutality. One feed, however, has dedicated itself entirely to the Black Lives Matter movement. \u201cAthletes 4 Black Lives Matter\u201d is an Instagram account created and operated by a pair of University of Virginia athletes. Hailey Barnett, a member of the women\u2019s rowing team, runs the account with her twin sister, Myla Grace Barnett, who competes for the UVa women\u2019s lacrosse team. The Instagram page, which started on June 7, posts videos of various athletes and coaches speaking in support of the Black Lives Matter movement. Black athletes like Fred Barnett, a former NFL receiver and father of Hailey and Myla, shared a message on the platform. UVa football player Charles Snowden also was featured on the page. White athletes and coaches, like Virginia men\u2019s lacrosse head coach Lars Tiffany, also submitted videos to the page. Tiffany spoke about former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick and how the quarterback\u2019s message was previously misconstrued to be about the U.S. flag. Tiffany admitted that he once took offense to Kaepernick\u2019s protests before listening and learning about why the quarterback would kneel during the national anthem. \u201cMany Americans are not living the life that that flag is supposed to represent,\u201d Tiffany said in his video. \u201cJustice, opportunity, social equity \u2013 it isn\u2019t a reality.\u201d By consistently posting videos from different athletes and coaches, the account shows different perspectives of athletes who support Black Lives Matter. Using Instagram also creates a library of the videos. If someone visits the page, they can go back and watch Tiffany speak or hear the perspective of Kyle Harrison, a professional lacrosse player and former collegiate National Player of the Year. As opposed to a statement or a one-time video, the page ensures the Black Lives Matter stays on top of mind, while also putting names and faces to people who support the movement. \u201cWe were thinking about doing blogs and maybe just like a message, but we believe that with sharing people\u2019s voice, seeing their faces, it\u2019s different,\u201d Myla said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing like the difference between a text and a phone call on your birthday. You remember who called you.\u201d In total, the account posted just over 40 videos since June 7. In just under a month, it\u2019s reached over 1,400 followers. Official NCAA accounts and former UVa men\u2019s basketball star De\u2019Andre Hunter are among those following along with the posts. An idea to give athletes an organized platform to share their support for the Black community quickly caught on. Hailey and Myla hope people use the videos to start listening and learning to others about the purpose behind the Black Lives Matter movement. \u201cThe world is an uncomfortable place right now,\u201d Myla said. \u201cUncomfortable conversations are taking place. As athletes, we know that with discomfort, there\u2019s room for growth and that only excites us to grow and have these conversations and to jump right in.\u201d By welcoming video submissions from athletes and coaches of any race, age or gender, the account aims to provide a thorough collection of ideas about the significance of the Black Lives Matter movement from the perspective of those in the sports world. As some people\u2019s social media feeds slowly transition away from a steady flow of Black Lives Matter content, Hailey and Myla are committed to using their platforms as athletes to speak out against racial injustice. \u201cWe\u2019ve been getting texts every now and then from people saying like, \u2018This is really inspiring. I\u2019ve been enjoying so much looking through your page and seeing all the perspectives and learning and listening,\u2019\u201d Hailey said. \u201cIt\u2019s been keeping this momentum going, so it\u2019s really just up from here.\u201d","423":"Meghan McCool was looking for jobs in the Philadelphia area when her phone rang. The Washington Spirit was on the other end of the line. After training with the team in March, COVID-19 sent McCool home without a contract. McCool kept in touch with the Spirit, a National Women\u2019s Soccer League team that wanted to bring her into the fold. Unfortunately, COVID-19 kept causing issues, and the Spirit kept delaying when they might officially sign McCool. With abundant uncertainty, the former Virginia star wondered if she\u2019d ever actually receive the deal and join the team. \u201cI kind of started doubting everything because it was so up in the air and questionable and then one day completely out of the blue they called me, and they were like, \u2018We figured everything out, we want to sign you, we have a contract,\u2019\u201d McCool said. McCool put pen to paper, and the Spirit officially announced her one-year signing on June 9. Her signing meant she\u2019d be a member of the organization for the NWSL Challenge Cup, a one-month tournament in Utah to kick off the league\u2019s return to action. Somehow, the situation only became more hectic from there. After finishing her senior season at UVa in the fall and training with the Spirit in March, McCool spent most of her time working out in Charlottesville during the pandemic. She trained on fields alone, working on her skills and aiming to stay in game shape. Her boyfriend\u2019s mom is a personal trainer, so McCool relied on her guidance for conditioning work. When she joined Washington in June, she was thrown into a full 11-on-11 practice her first day. In less than a month, McCool and the team traveled to Utah for the NWSL Challenge Cup, which began on June 27. Typically, professional teams ease into seasons with lengthy training camps. McCool didn\u2019t have that benefit in her first season as a professional. Even though she stayed in shape on her own, preparing for professional soccer is a different beast. \u201cThis is definitely the biggest jump from levels I\u2019ve ever had,\u201d McCool said. \u201cI think that\u2019s saying a lot because I came from one of the best programs in college soccer. UVa was awesome, the training environment was awesome, we had the best coaching staff. I might be biased, but I think they prepared us as well as you possibly could imagine, but this level \u2014 no one takes it lightly and everyone\u2019s physical, everybody\u2019s in shape.\u201d Speed jumps out the most to McCool. At the professional level, everything moves quickly. In college, McCool might be able to get away with zoning out for a few moments. At the professional level, losing focus for a moment or two can result in a lost opportunity for a goal. The speed and physical play are the two biggest areas of adjustment for McCool. \u201cTraining, you\u2019re playing against your teammates, yeah, but they\u2019re not afraid to absolutely rock you and prepare you for the game,\u201d McCool said. \u201cI think that\u2019s a little different than college. I think people are too nice in college.\u201d Once she joined the team in preparation for the Challenge Cup, McCool learned quickly the intensity of the league during workouts and scrimmages. \u201cI\u2019ve had a couple moments when you just get absolutely laid out, and you\u2019re like \u2018OK, I need to be a little stronger,\u2019\u201d McCool laughed. While the first three weeks of her contract have been a whirlwind, McCool finds herself on a loaded roster of professional soccer stars. She\u2019s competing at the highest level, and she also has a coaching staff eager to build her confidence. Given the circumstances, it\u2019d be easy for McCool to feel overwhelmed by the last few weeks. The coaches want to make sure the former UVa standout believes in her own abilities. \u201cI think once I made the roster I was able to take a deep breath,\u201d McCool said. \u201cI had a couple meetings with the coaches and they were like, \u2018You\u2019re here for a reason. Yeah, it\u2019s going to be a new level, you\u2019re gonna have to get your feet under you, but you need to be confident.\u2019 I think that really helped me, and since I\u2019ve just been able to do what I know and trust myself a little bit more.\u201d Head coach Richie Burke gathered all of the rookies after the team\u2019s first game, asking them what they thought of the level. All the youngsters are adjusting to the style of play at the professional level, and the coaching staff wants to move them along quickly so they\u2019ll be ready when called upon in meaningful matches as the tournament progresses. It\u2019s a learning process for the young players, but Burke and the coaches want to help. While McCool has yet to take the field in the Spirit\u2019s first two games, she\u2019s hopeful to make her professional debut soon. In what\u2019s been a hectic few weeks, McCool is ready for the next whirlwind moment. \u201cI have been dressing,\u201d McCool said. \u201cThat was one of my goals to make the dressing roster, so that\u2019s been good, but I think ultimately, obviously, everybody wants to play. I would like to get into a game at some point and go from there.\u201d","424":"When the Virginia men\u2019s basketball team takes the court for the 2020-21 season, the Cavaliers will be the reigning national champions. After UVa won the crown in 2018-19, COVID-19 halted the 2019-20 season before the NCAA Tournament. With a loaded returning group, the Cavaliers stand a legitimate chance of defending their title. Here are three pressing questions as the Cavaliers prepare to enter their title defense in the coming months. How will the Cavaliers adapt?On paper, Virginia looks like a national title contender. The Cavaliers\u2019 roster includes an experienced point guard, an elite wing scorer and a versatile 7-footer. That\u2019s a coach\u2019s dream. Tony Bennett, UVa\u2019s coach, is a fan\u2019s dream. He leads the program with poise and a commitment to defensive excellence. Given the talent on the roster and Bennett\u2019s pedigree, UVa should enter the 2020-21 season as an elite team with title aspirations. While the roster is special on paper, COVID-19 makes the upcoming season uncertain. Whether it\u2019s games being rescheduled or canceled or practice schedules being altered, it\u2019s hard to imagine a situation where COVID-19 doesn\u2019t impact college basketball. Positive COVID-19 tests could easily take players and coaches out of practices or games for weeks at a time. Something as simple as limited crowds could take away the home-court advantage the Cavaliers have felt for the past decade. On the flip side, road contests could become more winnable. If players test positive for the virus, teams will have their depth tested. If a guard or two misses a couple games, how will the backups step up in their absence? The No. 1 question facing any college athletic team in the next six months or so is how will they handle COVID-19? There are a lot of unanswered questions right now, but if UVa\u2019s schedule begins in November as planned, it\u2019s likely that COVID-19 will be a major storyline. How well will the team defend? Wait, I\u2019m questioning how a Tony Bennett team will defend? That\u2019s blasphemous. While it might seem crazy, offense likely won\u2019t be the question mark for the Cavaliers next season. Between Clark, Jay Huff, Sam Hauser and Tomas Woldetensae, the Cavaliers look the part of one of the most efficient offensive teams in the country. Defensively, Hauser flashed inconsistency at Marquette. He improved his junior season, and a year in Bennett\u2019s system as a redshirt player last year will help, but Hauser replaces an elite defender in Braxton Key. Mamadi Diakite also moves on, giving the Cavaliers one fewer elite defender. \u201cObviously losing Mamadi and Braxton, probably two of our better athletes on the team, we lose tremendous rebounding and some defensive versatility with both of those guys,\u201d associate head coach Jason Williford said in late April. Woldetensae also struggled defensively at times, earning playing time mostly due to his shooting prowess. Clark and Huff can defend at an elite level, but a few other players expected to play significant minutes have defensive question marks. When it comes to the incoming freshmen, will they receive enough practice time to adequately learn the defensive system? If COVID-19 impacts practice schedules, it could impact how quickly the youngsters learn the Pack Line defense. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a learning curve for the first-year guys, for sure,\u201d Williford said. Unlike last season, any questions facing Virginia come on the defensive end of the floor. Can guard play improve? UVa\u2019s guard play wasn\u2019t bad a season ago. Woldetensae found his shooting stroke as the season went on, and Kihei Clark developed into one of the best point guards in the ACC. \u201cEven when he was struggling, there was never a chance that he would get frustrated to the point where he would break,\u201d Hank Plona, Woldetensae\u2019s former JUCO coach, said of the shooter in February. \u201cHe\u2019s as tough of a 20- or 21-year-old man as there is.\u201d Clark and Woldetensae combined to make 84 3-pointers last season, with both players shooting over 35% from beyond the arc. Woldetensae was particularly efficient toward the middle of ACC action. Outside of those two, however, questions remain. Casey Morsell was a lock-down defender, but his shooting percentage left plenty to be desired. Morsell shot just 17.6% from 3-point range despite a solid shooting motion. Kody Stattmann, who battled illness and injury early in the season, only shot 26.9% from the 3-point line. He may be hard pressed to find consistent minutes given the team\u2019s influx of freshmen guards. Reece Beekman, a freshman point guard, could find himself as the primary backup to Clark. Carson McCorkle can shoot efficiently from beyond the arc, making him a candidate to earn minutes if Morsell and Stattmann don\u2019t improve their shooting percentages. Jabri Abdur-Rahim is more of a wing player, but the freshman will be asked to shoot from deep. \u201cI think we\u2019re going to live with Jay and Sam shooting a lot of jumpers, and then we got to hope that Kihei can shoot at his clip and we get Tomas and Casey and Kody and Jabri and Reece to give us additional 3-point shooting,\u201d Williford said. Virginia\u2019s guards are talented, but the shooting and consistency needs to improve for the Cavaliers to make a run at a national title.","425":"Internally, unbroken growth means the program is constantly improving. If UVa doesn\u2019t win the ACC Coastal Division or reach nine wins in 2020, it doesn\u2019t mean the Cavaliers\u2019 growth as a program is stunted. When Virginia lost to Clemson 63-17 in the ACC Championship game, the Wahoos looked like a far less talented team than the Tigers. Frankly, the Cavaliers were less talented. Still, Mendenhall didn\u2019t concede that the team\u2019s growth slowed or stopped because of the loss. \u201cThis game showed us exactly where this program has to go to be able to compete with one, two, three, four,\u201d Mendenhall said after the defeat. \u201cEvery year we\u2019ve gotten better, UVa has gotten better, so I think this game is going to allow everybody else coming back and for the years to come to know exactly how much to give and how much more they have to give and execute and how much more we have to execute at a higher level to be able to finally take over the ACC and achieve all our goals which we set out for.\u201d When UVa lost to Florida 36-28 in the Orange Bowl, the Cavaliers looked like they could win the game. While the Gators were the better team and it showed, the gap wasn\u2019t nearly as large as that between Virginia and Clemson. \u201cWe were a few plays short today in our execution to win the game, but it was not because of a lack of belief or confidence or ability,\u201d Mendenhall said after the loss to Florida. Despite losing its final two games of the season, Virginia\u2019s program took a step forward. The Cavaliers beat Virginia Tech for the first time since 2003. They won the Coastal Division and made an Orange Bowl appearance. The 2019 season was a good one for the Wahoos. The 2020 season brings with it major question marks due to COVID-19. It\u2019s hard to know if the team will even play a full schedule. This makes adapting critical. When it comes to taking a step forward in 2020, the Cavaliers need to find a consistent quarterback. They need to improve play in the secondary. They also need to navigate an unusual season with a global pandemic still happening. If UVa doesn\u2019t reach nine wins, it doesn\u2019t mean it can\u2019t improve as a program. When it comes to the program\u2019s general improvement, look for long-term clarity at quarterback, defensive depth and a consistent running attack. With its 2020 starting quarterback also likely holding the same role in 2021, there\u2019s a chance this season features the program taking a step back in the wins column before the group moves forward in 2021. The eventual goal is to contend for a spot in the College Football Playoff by winning the ACC. That\u2019s a process that could take years to reach. The unbroken growth in the win column might be tough to maintain, but that doesn\u2019t mean the Cavaliers won\u2019t internally take a step closer to their ultimate goal. Virginia wants to be a top program nationally in 2020 and that requires finding a quarterback and developing depth on both sides of the ball. Even with a handful of losses, those developments are possible. Last season\u2019s results The Cavaliers won nine games in 2019, but it realistically could\u2019ve been more. UVa played miserably in losses to Miami and Louisville. Both games were winnable, but the Cavaliers\u2019 offense struggled to do much of anything. A game against Notre Dame brought a challenge, but the offensive line allowed pressure on most passing plays. The Cavaliers were outscored 21-3 in the second half, falling 35-20. Virginia held chances to reach 10 wins, but offensive inconsistency and defensive injuries kept the Cavaliers from the elusive threshold. Overall, the season will be remembered as a positive. Virginia ended its losing streak to Virginia Tech, and it won its division. The program\u2019s first appearance in the Orange Bowl was a loss, but the appearance excited the fan base and engaged recruits. The season was filled with good moments. Notable departures Let\u2019s start at quarterback. Losing Bryce Perkins has the Cavaliers projected by some to finish the season below .500 and outside of the bowl picture. Perkins did everything at quarterback, serving as the team\u2019s best rusher in addition to the team\u2019s top passer. On the outside, the Cavaliers lose Hasise Dubois and Joe Reed. The wide receivers each exceeded 70 receptions in 2019, giving the Cavaliers consistent options at receiver. Reed also leaves a big gap at kick returner. Defensively, Eli Hanback moves on from the defensive line. His leadership and durability will be missed. Linebacker Jordan Mack and cornerback Bryce Hall are gone. Hall missed the final half of the 2019 season, but all three defenders were important leaders and contributors when healthy. Virginia lost critically important pieces on both sides of the football. Notable returners Virginia returns Brennan Armstrong as a potential starting quarterback. At running back, Wayne Taulapapa and Mike Hollins headline what could be one of the best running back rooms in the Mendenhall era. Every key contributor along the offensive line comes back, and wide receiver Terrell Jana enters the 2020 season as the No. 1 option in the passing game. Defensively, Jowon Briggs slides into the middle of the defensive line. He\u2019ll be flanked by players like Mandy Alonso and Aaron Faumui. Charles Snowden, Noah Taylor and Zane Zandier make up arguably the best linebacker unit in the conference. De\u2019Vante Cross, Brenton Nelson and Joey Blount are among the key returners at defensive back. UVa returns a solid group of players at most positions. Key additions Keytaon Thompson, a Mississippi State transfer, is the most notable addition. The talented quarterback can run and pass, and he\u2019ll compete with Armstrong to be Virginia\u2019s starter. The Cavaliers also added Ra\u2019Shaun Henry, an FCS transfer at wide receiver with one year of eligibility remaining. The 2020 recruiting class is filled with talent. The top recruit, offensive lineman Andrew Gentry, won\u2019t join the program until 2022 as he goes on a religious mission trip. \u201cAndrew is an amazing football player,\u201d Mendenhall said after the Cavaliers signed him. \u201cI would say to this point in the classes that we\u2019ve signed at the University of Virginia, he is the most skilled and talented and prepared at this level of any player that we have signed. He is exceptional in every way; the most highly recruited player that I think I\u2019ve ever recruited in terms of number of offers and elite level offers and quality of offers.\u201d Outside of Gentry, the next six highest rated recruits according to 24\/7 Sports are all on the defensive side of the ball. Given UVa\u2019s experience defensively, it\u2019s hard to expect many of those players to see significant time this season, especially with the potential for COVID-19 to impact practices. UVa\u2019s recruiting class is solid, but it\u2019s unknown how much they can contribute in 2020. 2020-21 outlook In many ways, Virginia football\u2019s 2020-21 fate is up to the coronavirus. Can Virginia get through a full schedule this fall? Will games be canceled or postponed? Could the season be moved to the spring? If teams play, can Virginia avoid losing key players for weeks at a time due to positive COVID-19 tests? Mendenhall loves adapting to challenges, and the 2020-21 season could be his largest challenge yet. Ideally, the Cavaliers play all their games safely. If that happens, there\u2019s reason for optimism for Virginia fans. For starters, the Cavaliers\u2019 defense looks strong. With Briggs leading the way in the middle of the defensive line, Virginia should generate a push up front. Defensive end is another position with experience. Virginia\u2019s linebackers are among the best in the ACC. There\u2019s a chance three or four of the team\u2019s top linebackers end up on NFL rosters in the next few seasons. While questions linger in the secondary, there are solid players at cornerback who just need more game experience. The safety position seems solid. By season\u2019s end, the Cavaliers might feature one of the top defenses in the ACC. Offensively, it\u2019s hard to know what to expect. The offensive line seems like the best of the Mendenhall era, but there are questions and doubts at every other offensive position. Who will step up at receiver with Dubois and Reed gone? Can one of UVa\u2019s top two quarterbacks control the offense? Will Ronnie Walker Jr. receive a transfer waiver to make the running back room significantly stronger? If UVa plays its full schedule without interruption \u2014 which is a massive if \u2014 the Cavaliers should field a team good enough to make a bowl game. There\u2019s a big difference between going 6-6 and 10-2, however, and that potential jump forward will be up to the offense. If Virginia finds a dynamic threat at quarterback, a trip to the ACC Championship Game could be in the cards. If Virginia can\u2019t find consistent quarterback play, it might be a fight to finish above .500. Expect growth in 2020, even if it\u2019s broken.","426":"In Ria Scott\u2019s first season leading the Virginia women\u2019s golf program, the Cavaliers finished 14th in the NCAA Championships and were ranked in the top 20 by multiple collegiate golf rankings. The results weren\u2019t quite as consistent in 2019-20 \u2014 Scott\u2019s second season. With a young team, the Cavaliers finished the year ranked 38th nationally, according to Golfstat. Despite technically taking a step back, UVa performed well given the departure of several seniors. Under Scott\u2019s guidance, the Cavaliers are poised to become one of the top programs in the country. A renovated Birdwood Golf Course gives the program a new facility to improve and attract recruits. \u201cWe\u2019re going to do nothing but appreciate it and use it to improve these players,\u201d Scott said of the team\u2019s new home. Expect positive results from the Cavaliers in future seasons. Last season\u2019s results In Scott\u2019s second season, results were mixed. Several tournaments saw the Cavaliers finish toward the bottom of the field, while others \u2014 mostly toward the end of the shortened season \u2014 featured Virginia at the top of fields. Riley Smyth, a rising junior, excelled. She secured a few top-10 individual finishes and finished with a scoring average of 73.5. Only rising sophomore Virginia Bossi posted a better season scoring average. The Italian, who averaged 73 shots per round for UVa, recently won a top amateur event in her home country. \u201cIt was really special for our underclassmen to step up like that,\u201d Scott said. A victory in the IJGA Collegiate Invitational in Mexico was the team\u2019s highlight of the season.Notable departures Virginia\u2019s seniors have jobs lined up, so they\u2019ll leave the program without taking advantage of spring eligibility relief. This means Julia Ford and Kate Harper\u2019s careers have come to a close. Both players were solid contributors, leaving a pair of open spots on the roster. Notable returners Bossi and Smyth are two critical pieces returning next season. Both players performed well in 2019-20, and Smyth flashed impressive ability in 2018-19 as well. \u201cWhen I first came to UVa, she wasn\u2019t even hitting full golf shots because she had her second hip surgery two years ago,\u201d Scott said of Smyth. \u201cShe went from not hitting full golf shots to competing in the national championship in about a span of a year.\u201d Fully healthy now, Smyth used the break due to COVID-19 to work on her game. She\u2019s feeling confident in her ability to post under-par rounds. If she can limit mistakes, she can become one of the most dynamic golfers in the ACC. Beth Lillie, a rising senior, is another returner with talent. She recently won a local amateur tournament and has nine top-10 finishes in her three-year career. Lillie earned All-ACC honors as a freshman and sophomore. Virginia enters 2020-21 with quality players across its roster. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely really encouraging because after last year we lost three seniors, so being able to come back this fall and know that the majority of team is returning is really encouraging,\u201d Smyth said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of potential for us.\u201d Key additions Official additions to the 2020-21 roster have yet to be announced, but two roster spots are open with the seniors departing. 2020-21 outlook Virginia returns a group of key contributors for Scott\u2019s third season. With a new golf facility and an experienced roster, the Cavaliers should be a top-20 caliber team nationally assuming COVID-19 doesn\u2019t halt the season. Look for the Wahoos to perform well when they\u2019re allowed back on the course.","427":"Members of the Virginia football team returned to Grounds on Sunday to resume workouts.\u00a0 It is the first time that the Cavaliers have been on Grounds since the COVID-19 pandemic shut down all athletic activity at the school back in March.\u00a0 Protocols and plans for student-athletes return have been coordinated through the UVa Health System, which has collaborated with officials at the local, state and national levels. Prior to resumption of daily sports functions, all student-athletes and staff will receive COVID-19 specific education through a variety of print and video media, utilizing CDC and NCAA resources. The UVa Health System will administer and coordinate testing of student-athletes and staff. It is required to report positive tests or cases to the Thomas Jefferson Health District of the Virginia Department of Health and to report all testing results to the athletics program\u2019s team physicians. \u200b UVa\u2019s summer and preseason dates are based on its season-opening game against Georgia on Monday, Sept. 7 in Atlanta, and the schedule guidelines approved by the NCAA Division I Council this week. Here is the Cavaliers' training schedule for the summer.\u00a0 July 5-14 \u2013 Voluntary activity July 15-25 \u2013 Required activity (up to eight hours per week of weight training, conditioning, film review) July 26-Aug. 8 \u2013 Required activity (up to 20 hours per week of activity include walk-thru sessions) Aug. 9 \u2013 Fall training camp opens (a five-day acclimatization period, followed by the opportunity for up to 25 on-field practices)","428":"For former Virginia soccer standouts Henry Kessler, Meghan McCool and Zoe Morse, their dream of playing professionally becomes reality in an unusual circumstance. Morse made her debut in the NWSL\u2019s Challenge Cup, competing in Utah. McCool also is in Utah, awaiting her professional debut in the league\u2019s \u201cbubble.\u201d Kessler started his MLS season in the spring in traditional circumstances before COVID-19 halted the season after he played just two matches. His season resumes Thursday in Orlando, as the MLS aims to compete in its own bubble. Kessler and the New England Revolution arrived in Orlando a few days ago. All three former Virginia players are adjusting to life as a professional athlete amid COVID-19. For the NWSL and MLS, that means limiting where you go. \u201cI think there was a lot of uncertainty coming in before we got here about what the health precautions would be, how we would balance that with having a very legitimate competition, but it\u2019s been really good,\u201d Morse, a defender for the Chicago Red Stars, said. \u201cWe get tested a lot, and we wear masks, and we\u2019re cleaning everything every day, so I don\u2019t have any worries in terms of the virus, which has allowed us to really focus primarily on soccer and just coming together as a team.\u201d Players stay close to their hotels, trying to socially distance from peers while limiting close interactions as much as possible. Frequent testing is required to ensure players don\u2019t spread the virus. While health is the No. 1 priority of the leagues, the process isn\u2019t without hiccups. The Orlando Pride withdrew from the NWSL Challenge Cup days before it started due to positive COVID-19 tests. Reports surfaced that some players visited a bar in the days before testing positive, illustrating the lack of control leagues have over individual player behavior. There\u2019s more league control in the single-site location. With the athletes in the bubble, the two soccer leagues are trying to find a balance between safety and basic entertainment. Understandably, the players don\u2019t want to be locked in their rooms all day, so there are activities they can do in and around their hotels to remain occupied while also limiting exposure to the virus. \u201cI think they\u2019re doing a really good job trying to abide by all the precautions and follow all of the guidelines, while still giving us a little bit of freedom and trying to let us breathe,\u201d McCool, a forward for the Washington Spirit, said. \u201cThey\u2019ve done a very good job with the setup.\u201d The NWSL setup includes ping pong tables, oversized Connect Four and Jenga. There\u2019s also a patio area with a small fireplace that teams can reserve. In Orlando, the setup is similar. Players can utilize PlayStations, poker tables and ping pong tables. \u201cThere\u2019s still stuff to do, and with us training hard, there\u2019s not too much we would be doing anyways,\u201d Kessler said. Even though Kessler hasn\u2019t been in the bubble for long, he\u2019s taken to the poker tables. \u201cSpecifically with the younger guys,\u201d Kessler said. \u201cYou play with the older guys the buy-in is a little heavy.\u201d Morse, in addition to taking walks in the parking lot of her hotel to get fresh air and break up the day, spends time watching \u201cAvatar: The Last Airbender.\u201d The show she watched as a kid is on Netflix, and she\u2019s toward the end of season 1 with two seasons left to go. Living, training, playing and relaxing in a single site is odd, and it\u2019s certainly not what many athletes expected of their rookie seasons. With COVID-19 still prevalent in the U.S., however, the new way of life offers a chance to play meaningful games while remaining safe from the virus. It\u2019s different, but the former Wahoos are adapting. \u201cObviously, it\u2019s not what I would have expected coming into this,\u201d Morse laughed, \u201cbut it\u2019s been incredible. It\u2019s been a super unique experience. Obviously there\u2019s no guidebook for how to handle these situations, but overall it\u2019s been incredible just getting to come in and play with the players who are here.\u201d","429":"Then, COVID-19 hit the figurative pause button on the Major League Soccer season, halting the former Virginia star\u2019s first season with the New England Revolution. Thursday, the Revolution\u2019s season resets when they take the field for the MLS is Back Tournament in Orlando. Kessler and New England are among the teams competing in the single-site tournament, which means the athletes live, train and compete in one general place with the other teams in the league. \u201cAlways had the dream of being a professional soccer player,\u201d Kessler said. \u201cDid not foresee this coming, and it\u2019s been quite the adjustment.\u201d After two solid showings as a professional, Kessler felt like he developed a routine. He found comfort in his training and the team\u2019s playing style. Stopping the season meant Kessler lost his routine. COVID-19 restrictions changed how teams could train, and it left Kessler with both physical and mental challenges since the team\u2019s last game on March 7. Kessler decided to view the stopped season differently than some athletes who viewed a stop in training from the coronavirus as a reset. Some changed their goals and altered their training, looking to improve new areas of their game. Kessler didn\u2019t want to look at the months off like that. \u201cI think a reset is almost something you do when you\u2019ve started negatively, where I thought was doing pretty well,\u201d Kessler said. After building confidence from a strong start to the season, Kessler wanted to keep that going. When it came to initially adjusting to the professional level, Kessler had to go from a leader on UVa\u2019s team that made the 2019 national championship match to one of the youngest players on the Revolution\u2019s roster. In Charlottesville, Kessler held younger players accountable, demanding their best. In New England, many of the older players demand excellence of the newcomers. The defender enjoys the level of accountability at the professional level, though. Everyone expects greatness from their teammates. It made Kessler\u2019s adjustment mentally quite enjoyable. \u201cI was always a guy who really gets on guys,\u201d Kessler said. \u201cSometimes even in college my coaches had to tell me to tone it back a little bit.\u201d At the professional level, players \u201cget on each other\u201d about performing to the best of their ability. Kessler loves the additional competition and intensity. He\u2019s excited to return to game competition Thursday, amid the MLS \u201cbubble.\u201d Kessler and the Revolution quarantined for nearly 24 hours upon arrival in Orlando, awaiting COVID-19 test results. The team received fantastic results, with no positive tests. \u201cThankfully, we didn\u2019t have any positive tests, so after that things have been smoother,\u201d Kessler said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been able to train properly.\u201d The return-to-play tournament hasn\u2019t lacked COVID-19 issues, though. FC Dallas withdrew from the tournament Monday after 10 players and a support staff member tested positive for COVID-19. \u201cGiven the impact of the number of positive tests on the club\u2019s ability to train and play competitive matches, we have made the decision to withdraw FC Dallas from the MLS is Back Tournament,\u201d MLS Commissioner Don Garber said in a statement. \u201cThe health of everyone involved in our return to play has always been our top priority, and we will continue to make decisions consistent with that priority.\u201d Nashville SC also experienced issues after multiple positive tests. New England avoided that fate, at least for now, arriving in Orlando without players or staff members testing positive. The NWSL also had a team withdraw from its Challenge Cup in late June, but the tournament seems to be safely taking place since it started at the end of June. The MLS hopes for similar results once the tournament begins. For Kessler, the biggest worry about playing in Orlando after safely entering the single-site tournament location is the heat difference between Massachusetts and Florida. Adjusting to summer in the south may prove challenging for the first week or so. From there, he\u2019s excited to return to competition on a national stage. Assuming the tournament takes place safely, few team sports in the U.S. will receive as much attention as the MLS in the next few weeks. Kessler\u2019s unusual rookie season could help him and the Revolution gain new fans. \u201cWe have a good opportunity being back before the other sports start,\u201d Kessler said. \u201cHopefully we can attract more fans to the sport.\u201d","430":"Paul Kosanovich planned to play summer league baseball in Palm Springs, California. The Virginia pitcher would\u2019ve competed in the Southern California Collegiate Baseball League. COVID-19 changed those plans. Looking for other playing options, Kosanovich learned of a one-month league hosted in Ranger, Texas. Initially, Kosanovich debated whether he should join the league in a small Texas town or stay home to work out and throw when possible. After conversations with his parents, Kosanovich decided he wanted to keep the competitive juices flowing. The town in Texas with a population of only about 2,500 became the right-hander\u2019s home starting in early June. The Palm Springs Collegiate League wraps up play Friday, with players departing Saturday. Being a California native, Kosanovich made the 19-hour drive to Texas with a friend also competing in the league. The long road trip was worth it, according to the pitcher. \u201cJust playing again is awesome, plain and simple,\u201d Kosanovich said. \u201cObviously not being at a competition and losing the season, it sucks and it makes you really appreciate what you had before. Just getting a chance to be out there again is awesome.\u201d It\u2019s been a productive month for Kosanovich, who had logged 26 1\/3 innings through Wednesday\u2019s action. In those innings, the Virginia reliever started three games and appeared in relief four times. He leads the league in strikeouts with 50, while also sporting a remarkable 1.03 ERA. Kosanovich hasn\u2019t allowed a run in his last 14 1\/3 innings, and he\u2019s struck out 33 batters in that span. He tossed a seven-inning, complete-game shutout in a recent victory. He allowed three hits and struck out 15. The competition level in the league is mixed, according to Kosanovich, but even against inferior foes, his numbers pop. Of the 79 outs he\u2019s recorded, 63.3% have come via strikeout. \u201cMy strikeout numbers are up,\u201d Kosanovich said. \u201cThere are some guys who haven\u2019t done much, but there\u2019s some good players in this league, and it just kind of proves to myself the work that I\u2019ve put in, and how everything\u2019s going with my pitches, and how everything\u2019s moving that I\u2019m kind of earning these.\u201d He enters every game with the intention of hitting his spots and working on his pitches. It doesn\u2019t matter where the batter attends college or the quality of the hitter at the plate, Kosanovich is focused on his game. As he took the mound one game for an early start, he caught himself feeling complacent and lacking the energy he usually brings to the mound. He quickly altered his mindset, forcing himself to focus and engage mentally. Living in a dorm in a small Texas town in the summer could cause boredom or a slip in focus. Kosanovich doesn\u2019t want to be the guy taking the experience for granted. \u201cIt\u2019s one of those things where if you embrace it, you\u2019re going to do nothing but get better because all you have to do is play baseball,\u201d Kosanovich said, \u201cbut if you just sit here every day and think, \u2018Oh, why did I come out here? I\u2019m in the dorms, this sucks\u2019 then you\u2019re not here for the right reasons.\u201d Kosanovich, who will return to Virginia for a redshirt senior season, used the month to work on his pitches in game competition. He feels confident in his fastball and slider, and his changeup worked well in his last start as a swing-and-miss pitch. He even mixed in a few curveballs to keep hitters off balance in the 15-strikeout performance. The 6-foot-4, 235-pound pitcher with long blonde hair dominates the Texas summer league amid a global pandemic. He\u2019s embraced living in a dorm and the one-month baseball grind in intense heat \u2014 the projected high for Friday\u2019s championship is 98 degrees. It\u2019s unusual, but it\u2019s still baseball. \u201cI couldn\u2019t ask for anything more,\u201d Kosanovich said. \u201cWith everything going on right now, just the opportunity to be at a remote place where it\u2019s strictly just playing baseball.\u201d","431":"In a release, the conference said the decision \u201callows each campus to further focus on ensuring return to competition protocols are in place to facilitate the resocialization process.\u201d Men\u2019s soccer, women\u2019s soccer, cross country, field hockey and volleyball all competed in scrimmages or games prior to Sept. 1 last season. Fall sports schedules for many of the University of Virginia\u2019s programs have yet to be announced. Last season, both the UVa women\u2019s soccer and volleyball teams played three matches prior to Sept. 1. Women\u2019s soccer also competed in a pair of exhibitions in August. Field hockey competed in one match, while also holding a pair of exhibitions in August. Both men\u2019s soccer and cross country competed once last August. The UVa football team\u2019s season opener is scheduled for Sept. 7 against Georgia in Atlanta, so the ACC\u2019s announcement geared toward Olympic sports doesn\u2019t impact that scheduled game. The Cavaliers returned to Grounds earlier this week to begin voluntary workouts in preparation for the 2020-21 football season. The program has yet to announce any COVID-19 test results. Other football programs such as North Carolina and Ohio State stopped voluntary workouts after positive COVID-19 tests within the program. It\u2019s unclear how widespread these types of delays will be around FBS programs, but it\u2019s likely other Power 5 programs will follow suit if they experience an influx of positive cases within the team or staff. Earlier this week, the Ivy League announced the postponement of all athletic competition for the fall semester. There\u2019s a possibility fall Ivy League squads compete in the spring, with a decision expected at a later date. The ACC mentioned in its announcement that \u201cthe league continues to discuss the impact of COVID-19 on fall schedules and competitions with the understanding that there may be future changes, and that priority remains the health and safety of our student-athletes.\u201d While this announcement offers some news, it offers little clarity as to how the fall sports season might actually look or if it\u2019s feasible at all. In some cases, as we\u2019ve seen with the Ivy League, the path forward might not include a fall sports season. This is far from the last piece of news about the attempted return of collegiate sports in the fall.","432":"The reigning national champion Virginia men\u2019s lacrosse program announced its 2020 recruiting class Thursday. The Cavaliers added 10 freshmen who will join the team next season. After missing high school lacrosse in the spring because of COVID-19, the players may arrive in Charlottesville with a bit of rust. They won\u2019t have long to knock off the cobwebs when they join the Cavaliers, who return an experienced and talented roster looking to contend for another national title. Internally, the competition within the program should be fierce when its deemed safe to return to practice. \u201cEager to compete is the understatement of the year,\u201d head coach Lars Tiffany said in a statement. \u201cWith the absence of their final high school season, these 10 incoming first-year men have much to prove. Our returners and staff yearn for the opportunity to introduce them to our program and its defining culture and to witness their impact.\u201d Here is a look at the Cavaliers recruiting class. Gable Braun, midfielder, 6-foot-1, 185 pounds: Braun is a top-100 player who played five years on his varsity team. He played high school lacrosse in the Maryland area. The standout performer was particularly excellent at faceoffs. \u201cWhen I first arrived on grounds I was astonished by how beautiful it was, and I easily envisioned myself being a student-athlete there,\u201d Braun said in a statement. Bobby Gavin, goalie, 6-0, 185: The California native adds depth to UVa\u2019s goalkeeper position. He\u2019ll likely learn the Cavaliers\u2019 system before attempting to earn a larger role. Alex Rode seems like a sure bet to start between the pipes in 2021. \u201cIn all of my college visits, there was no campus that was more beautiful than UVa,\u201d Gavin said in a statement. \u201cAthletics and academics are among the top in the country.\u201d During his youth lacrosse days, Gavin was coached by former Cavalier Jason Leneau. Gavin credits that interaction as something that made him like UVa. Mikie Harmeyer, attack, 5-11, 165: A 2019 US Lacrosse All-American, Harmeyer comes to Virginia as a proven winner. He won three state titles in lacrosse while also playing on his high school football team. He\u2019s another Maryland product that will join the Wahoos. \u201cRight when I stepped on grounds I knew it was my home,\u201d Harmeyer said in a statement. Cole Kastner, defense, 6-7, 215: Kastner brings great size to Virginia\u2019s defense. A US Lacrosse All-American, Kastner\u2019s size also translated well to the basketball court. The California native averaged 17 points and 10 rebounds per game as a senior. He\u2019s a top-tier athlete. Connell Kumar, midfield, 6-3, 190: A 2019 US Lacrosse All-American, the New Jersey native is an elite recruit. He was named the best midfielder by Paul Rabil\u2019s Project 9, an invitation-only event featuring some of the best high school players in the nation. Russ Maher, attack\/midfield, 6-1, 195: Inside Lacrosse named Maher, a New York native, a top-30 recruit in 2019. He\u2019s a talented player who can score and distribute. While the Cavaliers look stacked at attack next season, Maher\u2019s ability translates well for future seasons. Given the team\u2019s talent, many of the freshmen will be able to develop in 2021 without being thrust into game action. Patrick McIntosh, attack, 6-1, 185: A California native, McIntosh wrapped up his high school career in Connecticut. He\u2019s yet another elite athlete who excelled in multiple sports. McIntosh played soccer for four years in high school. \u201cI chose Virginia because it felt like home when I was on grounds,\u201d McIntosh said in a statement. He credited a gut feeling when he toured grounds with the coaches as pushing him over the top to commit to Virginia. \u201cOn top of that, who doesn\u2019t want to be given an opportunity, year in and year out, to compete for a national championship with an amazing team and coaches?\u201d he said. \u201cThis helped make the decision clear.\u201d Mike Prestipino, defense, 5-9, 175: Prestipino is a two-time US Lacrosse All-American from Pennsylvania. He\u2019s an elite lacrosse defender who also performed well on the football field, especially on special teams. He says he\u2019s wanted to attend UVa since visiting grounds in 2016. Jack Walshe, midfield, 6-2, 195: A midfielder from New York, Walshe checks in as the 87th-best recruit nationally, according to Inside Lacrosse. He won a state title in 2019, and also competed as part of Ireland\u2019s 2020 under-19 national team. Ben Wayver, long-stick midfielder, 6-3, 205: Rounding out the class is a special athlete from Alexandria. Wayver spent four years as a lacrosse starter while also winning two state titles at St. Stephens & St. Agnes. He competed on a basketball team that earned state-runner up honors in 2020. He also spent two years starting for his football team at defensive end. In addition to that, he played two years of soccer and started at forward. Wayver is among the best athletes in Virginia\u2019s 2020 recruiting class. \u201cMy dad would always take me to see at least one UVa lacrosse game at Kl\u00f6ckner Stadium every year,\u201d Wayver said in a statement. \u201cHe got my brother and I to wear UVa lacrosse jerseys to the 2011 national championship game in Baltimore. Ever since then I thought it would be awesome to play lacrosse at UVa and get to play in front of that many fans.\u201d","433":"Charlie Patterson, a three-star offensive tackle from Roswell, Georgia, verbally committed to the the Virginia football program Thursday evening. Patterson picked UVa after receiving 36 offers, according to Rivals. The 6-foot-6, 280-pound lineman chose Bronco Mendenhall\u2019s program over schools such as Mississippi State, West Virginia and Boston College. Patterson thanked his coaches in a tweet announcing his commitment. He also mentioned the bond he created with UVa\u2019s coaches, including offensive line coach Garett Tujague, in their communication. \u201cThank you to Coach Tujague and Coach Mendenhall for making this an easy decision,\u201d Patterson tweeted. \u201cI already feel like part of the family and can\u2019t wait to get started.\u201d Patterson becomes the 16th member of UVa\u2019s 2021 recruiting class. The Cavaliers also added a pair of impact transfers this spring, but they\u2019ll join the program for the 2020 season. The newest commit is the third player designated as an offensive lineman to join the 2021 class. Interestingly, all three of the offensive linemen are from Georgia. Ty Furnish also plays in Roswell and Hugh Laughlin is from Athens. Each lineman is a three-star prospect, according to Rivals. Laughlin, however, is projected to play defensive line at UVa. Mendenhall mentioned during spring media sessions the desire to add a few offensive linemen to the 2021 class, so Patterson likely isn\u2019t the last offensive lineman addition to the 2021 recruiting class. Of the 16 verbal commitments in UVa\u2019s 2021 football recruiting class, 13 are three-star prospects, per Rivals. One player, defensive end Josh McCarron, is a four-star prospect. Two commits are two-star players. Despite the COVID-19 pandemic bringing into question the viability of the 2020 fall football season, UVa\u2019s recruiting keeps rolling along.","434":"The Virginia signee wanted to show everyone in the Northwoods League, a collegiate summer league with teams based in the Midwest, that he belonged on the roster. The catcher earned his first start on July 3. Teel blasted a pair of home runs, producing fireworks a day before the Fourth of July. He drove in three runs and helped the Wisconsin Rapids Rafters beat the Wisconsin Woodchucks 12-6. \u201cIt was my first start, so I needed to prove that I deserve to be on the field,\u201d Teel said. \u201cI felt confident up at the plate, and I don\u2019t know I feel like everything went well for me that day.\u201d One of Virginia\u2019s top prospects entering next season opted to bypass the MLB Draft and head to Virginia out of high school. That\u2019s great news for Brian O\u2019Connor\u2019s club. Teel is an elite defensive talent behind the plate. In the batter\u2019s box, the left-handed hitter offers plenty of upside. He worked on his body at home in New Jersey once his high school season ended prematurely due to COVID-19. Teel feels stronger than he did a few months ago. He believes extra time spent gaining strength can pay dividends when he steps to the plate. \u201cI think that quarantine did help with the strength aspect of my game, and I\u2019m starting to see it on the field,\u201d Teel said. The Northwoods League gives Teel a good chance to showcase his improved strength on a regular basis. Games take place every day through mid-August, giving Teel and others a chance to take the diamond for meaningful game experience throughout their time in Wisconsin. There\u2019s also a designated hitter position in the league, allowing Teel to split time at catcher and designated hitter and rest when needed, so he doesn\u2019t spend two months logging long innings at catcher every day. For a high schooler crazed about baseball, it\u2019s a welcomed change to go from no organized baseball to a game each day. \u201cI love it,\u201d Teel said. \u201cFor me, I\u2019m really grateful that baseball\u2019s back and I feel like I appreciate the game a little more now that it was taken away from us for a while. I\u2019m so excited to play every single day.\u201d The Rafters have clicked early in the season, racing out to a 7-1 start through July 8. With a team ERA of just 2.78 and an offense posting an average of 7.6 runs per contest, it\u2019s no surprise the Rafters are picking up wins. Teel, who will join a loaded Virginia team with national title hopes next season, wants to win a summer league title before eventually heading to Charlottesville. He feels good about his team\u2019s chances. \u201cI just feel like we have great team chemistry,\u201d Teel said. \u201cWe get along really well. We\u2019re all from different places in the country, and we\u2019re learning a lot about each other.\u201d With a game every day and COVID-19 restrictions, it can be hard to find time for activities other than baseball, but Teel has made sure to try a Wisconsin staple. \u201cWe\u2019re on the field pretty much all day, but what I have noticed here is that there\u2019s a lot of cheese,\u201d Teel said. \u201cI\u2019ve eaten cheese curds for the first time. I love cheese curds.\u201d","435":"The Virginia football program reported its initial COVID-19 testing results Friday. Two of the 110 student-athletes who were tested upon their arrival on grounds received positive COVID-19 test results. Neither player required hospitalization, although it was not specified if either athlete showed symptoms. The result makes for a 1.8% positivity rate among the athletes tested. All positive tests were reported to the Thomas Jefferson Health District of the Virginia Department of Health. \u201c[Head coach] Bronco [Mendenhall] and I talk almost every day, and both of us felt like it was really important to be transparent,\u201d Virginia\u2019s director of athletics, Carla Williams, said of publicly releasing test results in an interview on Virginiasports.com. \u201cWe just think it\u2019s in the best interest of public health to have information. We just want the best possible opportunity to compete, and if we\u2019re going to give it a try, we want to be able to give it our best effort. Having information is better than not having information.\u201d The two players who tested positive for the virus must self-isolate for at least 10 days. If symptoms persist after those 10 days, the players must remain isolated until symptoms are gone and they go three days fever free. From there, a medical evaluation is required to clear them for sports activities. Cardiac screenings will take place for those players after they are cleared to resume activity. Close contacts of the two players \u2014 and close contacts of any other players who test positive in the future \u2014 will self-quarantine for at least 14 days. During that time, they won\u2019t participate in daily team activity that requires in-person attendance. UVa football players returned to grounds on July 5 for voluntary workouts, but the workouts didn\u2019t start until Friday as the team awaited their test results. Players underwent physical exams and cardiac testing this week as well. The program expects to continue voluntary workouts prior to required activity, which begins July 15 and allows for up to eight hours of weight training, conditioning and film study. Other Power 5 football programs, such as North Carolina and Ohio State, recently stopped voluntary workouts due to a high volume of positive COVID-19 tests within the program. The Big Ten also announced yesterday that it planned on playing only conference games for the fall season, assuming it\u2019s safe enough to play. The announcement came after the Ivy League postponed all fall athletic competition. While the viability of a fall college football season is in question, the Cavaliers hope to safely continue workouts in hopes of competing this fall. Virginia\u2019s season opener is scheduled for Sept. 7 against Georgia.","436":"Earlier Thursday, the ACC announced it would push all of its fall sports competitions to at least Sept. 1. There were some reports Thursday the ACC may soon follow suit with the Big Ten\u2019s decision, but those were premature. An announcement from ACC Commissioner John Swofford on Friday suggests that it will be a couple weeks until we learn more about the ACC\u2019s fall plans. \u201cAs we continue to work on the best possible path forward for the return of competition, we will do so in a way that appropriately coincides with our universities\u2019 academic missions,\u201d Swofford said in a statement. \u201cOver the last few months, our conference has prepared numerous scenarios related to the fall athletics season. The league membership and our medical advisory group will make every effort to be as prepared as possible during these unprecedented times, and we anticipate a decision by our Board of Directors in late July.\u201d A decision to play only conference games this fall could be on the table. Reports, including one from Richmond Times-Dispatch columnist David Teel, say Notre Dame would be included in ACC football contests if that was the case. The benefit to playing conference-only games is ensuring that each school on a team\u2019s schedule follows the same stringent COVID-19 testing and tracing protocols. While travel may still be an issue, it would ensure each conference team plays opponents who are following agreed upon health guidelines. Other potential scenarios include playing only a few conference opponents in multiple home-and-home contests. For example, UVa could play Virginia Tech twice in the same season. This could ensure games against conference foes in close proximity to each school. One possibility could mean following the Ivy League\u2019s lead by postponing all fall sports to the spring or canceling them altogether. Pushing games to the spring, however, would likely require agreement from every Power 5 conference. It\u2019s unlikely UVa would attempt to push football to the spring if other programs don\u2019t do the same. Otherwise, spring scheduling could prove impossible. Plenty of possibilities are being considered, leaving ACC fans to wait toward the end of the month for more insights. In the meantime, UVa and other football programs will continue voluntary workouts. The Cavaliers officially started workouts Friday after awaiting COVID-19 test results. Two of the 110 student-athletes who returned to grounds earlier this week tested positive for the virus. Other programs, such as North Carolina, stopped voluntary workouts after a high number of positive test results. The Tar Heels hope to reduce the number of cases before resuming activity. Financial impact Virginia director of athletics Carla Williams spoke with VirginiaSports.com for a question and answer session discussing the state of Virginia athletics. She briefly elaborated on how COVID-19 may impact the athletic department financially. \u201cThere\u2019s still no final word on what\u2019s going to happen with football, so we\u2019re anticipating anywhere from a 15 to 30 percent shortfall, and that\u2019s if we have an uninterrupted football and basketball season,\u201d Williams said. The department instituted a few cost-cutting measures, including cutting the budget by 10%. According to Williams, every coach and employee earning more than $100,000 annually took a voluntary pay cut, and others below that threshold also volunteered for pay cuts. \u201cWe\u2019ll know more over the next few weeks, because if we\u2019re not able to play the fall sports, or fall sports somehow get pushed to the spring, then, as you can see around the country, a lot of schools have had to take some drastic measures,\u201d Williams said. College athletic departments have had to lay off employees, while some have even cut certain sports altogether for financial reasons. Hubbard to transfer After appearing in two of UVa\u2019s 14 games in 2019, offensive lineman Ja\u2019Quay Hubbard entered the transfer portal. Hubbard announced the news Friday. \u201cAfter genuine and considerate conversation with my close family, I have decided to enter my name in the NCAA transfer portal with four years of eligibility,\u201d Hubbard wrote on Twitter. \u201cUVa is a remarkable program and is hard working. This is the best thing for me to be great.\u201d While Hubbard wasn\u2019t expected to see much action in 2020, the Pennsylvania native was a four-star recruit coming out of high school, according to Rivals. He\u2019s a quality athlete who had potential to earn a larger role for the Wahoos in future seasons.","437":"The Virginia men\u2019s basketball team\u2019s 2019-20 season can be best described as historically chaotic. The Cavaliers started the season with a 48-34 win over Syracuse, holding the Orange to their fewest points since a game against Sampson Navy in 1945. Roughly a month later, the Cavaliers were stomped by Purdue. Then they lost at home to South Carolina. UVa looked unusually suspect, especially on offense. ACC play started slowly, with the Wahoos sitting at 4-4 thanks to horrendous shooting. Then the Cavaliers made minor improvements offensively and simply found ways to win in the final few possessions. Virginia finished the season strong, pulling off narrow victory after narrow victory. Tony Bennett\u2019s team looked the part of an NCAA Tournament threat. To make a wild season even more remarkable, a global pandemic led to the cancellation of the season before postseason play arrived for the Wahoos. When looking back at the 2019-20 season, Virginia fans will remember a gritty team peaking before a new strain of virus slammed the door shut on the NCAA Tournament. The Cavaliers, and their fans, hope the 2020-21 season brings less stress, fewer coronavirus-related problems and a bunch of wins. Last season\u2019s results Virginia finished the 2019-20 season with a 23-7 record, including a 15-5 mark in ACC action. While the overall record is solid, it\u2019s how the Wahoos finished that deserves praise. UVa rattled off eight consecutive victories to end the season. The Cavaliers won 10 of their last 11 contests, taking down Duke, Florida State and Louisville in the process. By season\u2019s end, the Cavaliers transformed from a likely NIT participant to one of the top four teams in the ACC. The winning streak brought with it tremendous anxiety of Virginia fans who tuned in regularly. Eight of the team\u2019s final 10 victories came by three points or fewer. When UVa took the court in February and March, a close game was almost a guarantee. \u201cWe\u2019re giving a lot of people a heart attack,\u201d UVa guard Braxton Key joked after a 3-point win over Virginia Tech in February. Early in the season, Virginia dropped a few disappointing games. The Cavaliers were steamrolled by Purdue, losing by 29 points in Mackey Arena. Later in December, South Carolina came into Charlottesville and upset the \u2018Hoos by double digits. Virginia\u2019s nonconference schedule lacked quality opponents, and the Cavaliers struggled against the best opponents on its weak out-of-conference slate. After the rocky start, Tony Bennett\u2019s team found its footing in February. A late-season surge fueled by close wins and gritty defense made the Cavaliers a trendy pick to make a deep postseason run. \u201cI just think guys have moved the needle a little bit, and it\u2019s been enough,\u201d Bennett said after Virginia\u2019s regular-season finale, a win over Louisville. \u201cWe know what our lifeline is, trying to be as good as we can defensively, and we had good stretches of offense today. You hope you\u2019re always healthy, and you\u2019re playing sound, quality basketball heading into the ACC Tournament and, obviously, the NCAA Tournament as well.\u201d Unfortunately for college basketball fans, March Madness was canceled due to COVID-19, so the Cavaliers did not get a chance to defend their national title. They didn\u2019t compete in the ACC Tournament either, as the virus kept the Cavaliers from competing in any postseason games. Notable departures Mamadi Diakite and Braxton Key graduated, leaving the Cavaliers without two elite forwards. Diakite blossomed into Virginia\u2019s leading scorer a season ago, while Key brought unmatched versatility to the roster. Losing Diakite and Key hurts most on the defensive end. Both players were frequently tasked with guarding the opposing team\u2019s best wing player. The duo also rebounded at an impressive rate, helping control the glass with the help of players like Jay Huff. Off the court, Diakite served as one of the team\u2019s leaders. He held younger players accountable and held up his end of the bargain by performing at an All-ACC level. Notable returnersKihei Clark returns for his junior season. The point guard went through ups and downs a season ago as the primary point guard, but he played some of his best basketball toward the end of the year. Clark averaged 10.8 points and 5.9 assists per game, starting all 30 contests and logging an ACC-high 37.1 minutes per game. At times, fans criticized Clark for doing too much. In fairness, Clark was asked to do too much last season. He was expected to play close to 40 minutes a game as a primary on-ball defender and the primary ball handler. Rarely was Clark given a few moments to rest or play off the ball offensively. A few of the newcomers should help Clark in 2020-21. Tomas Woldetensae and Casey Morsell both return next year. Woldetensae developed into the team\u2019s most dynamic 3-point threat, while Morsell showed unusual poise as a freshman defender. He seamlessly transitioned into the defensive system, while his offense and shooting left significant room for improvement. In the low post, Jay Huff is expected to return to Virginia despite testing the NBA Draft waters. He can stretch a defense as a 3-point shooter or score inside with an array of post moves. His defense is elite thanks to his shot-blocking prowess. Francisco Caffaro adds depth in the post, and Justin McKoy is expected to earn minutes at small forward and power forward. Key additionsWhile technically on the roster a season ago, Sam Hauser wasn\u2019t able to play due to NCAA transfer rules. The wing from Marquette may garner some votes for ACC Preseason Player of the Year. He\u2019s a tremendous athlete with good size. He shoots well from the perimeter. If Hauser can defend efficiently, he\u2019ll likely be one of the ACC\u2019s best players. Trey Murphy III joins Virginia as a transfer from Rice. The athletic wing plans on sitting out the 2020-21 season before having two years of eligibility remaining for the Cavaliers. He\u2019s a candidate to take Hauser\u2019s minutes after Hauser leaves following this season. \u201cHe will bring a ton of versatility,\u201d UVa associate head coach Jason Williford said. \u201cHe can shoot the 3, put it on the floor. I think he\u2019s more of a combo guard, forward now with his size.\u201d Virginia brought in three freshmen as well. Reece Beekman was a triple-double machine in high school, and he\u2019ll compete immediately for the backup point guard spot. Expect him to see the court in 2020-21. Carson McCorkle joins the team as a perimeter shooter with the ability to attack the basket. McCorkle might redshirt in 2020-21 given the team\u2019s depth at the shooting guard position. Jabri Abdur-Rahim, a talented freshman wing, might stand the best chance of becoming a freshman starter. Given his height at 6-foot-7, Abdur-Rahim could fit in a lineup with Clark, Woldetensae, Hauser and Huff. The freshman can score in a variety of ways, making him an excellent candidate to earn minutes if he picks up the defense. 2020-21 outlookIt\u2019s unclear how COVID-19 might impact the college basketball season. If the virus is still impacting sports heavily in November, the Cavaliers may lose out on some nonconference games, which would be disappointing. The Wahoos have a thrilling nonconference schedule this year, with games against teams such as Temple and Villanova scheduled for the first two months of the year. A tournament with Georgetown, Kansas and UCLA also sits on the Wahoos\u2019 schedule, but it\u2019s unclear if travel to California will be allowed in late November. Whenever the Cavaliers take the court, the on-court product should be among the best nationally. Few teams feature a defensive system as effective and proven as Virginia\u2019s. Adding in Clark, Hauser and Huff should ensure the Cavaliers score in bunches. Teams with efficient offenses and defenses contend for national titles. Virginia looks like it\u2019s due for a special 2020-21 season, assuming COVID-19 doesn\u2019t derail the season yet again.","438":"BRISTOL, Tenn. \u2014 As Bristol Motor Speedway prepares for what could be the largest crowd at a U.S. stadium since the coronavirus pandemic shut down spectator sports this spring, some public health experts question the risks of welcoming as many as 30,000 fans at Wednesday\u2019s NASCAR All-Star Race. The race was originally scheduled to take place in Charlotte, North Carolina, but high rates of COVID-19 infections there prompted NASCAR to move the race to Bristol, where case numbers were much lower when the decision was announced in June. Speedway officials are implementing an extensive plan to enhance cleaning procedures, physically distance spectators in the stands and require fans to wear masks at most areas of the track, except for at their seats. BMS is also only filling part of its total capacity of about 160,000 seats and it\u2019s unclear if the maximum of 30,000 fans will actually attend. But the race comes amid increasing numbers of COVID-19 infections in the region, including what Ballad Health officials described Friday as a \u201cdrastic\u201d rise in Northeast Tennessee\u2019s cases. And in recent interviews, a number of public health experts said they are concerned about the safety of the race itself and the potential impacts on the surrounding community. Safety measures \u201cThe idea of putting 30,000 people in any venue is really, really frightening to me,\u201d said Jon McCullers, an infectious disease specialist at the University of Tennessee Health Science Center in Memphis. The speedway is staggering seating to provide at least 6 feet of distance between groups in the stands to limit physical proximity to one another. But in recent interviews, experts noted that in situations where people are yelling, cheering or talking loudly, COVID-19 \u2014 which can spread through respiratory droplets \u2014 could travel farther than the standard six feet often cited as a minimum distance people should keep from one another. Others said they would recommend that people wear their masks to limit the spread of respiratory droplets with the physical distancing measures in place. Even then, sitting in stands could still place people in proximity to others who are infected, but may be asymptomatic and silently spreading the virus. \u201cI would say if you\u2019re 12 to 15 feet away, wearing masks and there\u2019s a prohibition on cheering \u2014 if you can get NASCAR fans not to cheer, good luck \u2014 but if they were able to do that, I\u2019d feel a whole lot more comfortable, you\u2019d still have a bunch of people that were sick, but at least that\u2019s some risk mitigation,\u201d McCullers said. Costi Sifri, director of hospital epidemiology at the University of Virginia Health System, said he looks at infection control through the lens of what he called the \u201cthree Cs:\u201d closed spaces, crowded places and close contact. Health leaders are concerned about the virus\u2019 ability to spread in enclosed spaces with poor ventilation, which is less of a concern for an outdoor track like BMS. Still, Sifri said the other two Cs \u2014 crowds and close contacts \u2014 are particularly relevant to thinking about this event. \u201cEvery effort should be made to try and make sure that people are spaced even when they\u2019re walking through the arena,\u201d he said. For its part, BMS will post floor markings to remind people of the distances and implement a staggered exit plan at the end of the race. The speedway\u2019s plans won support from the Sullivan County Regional Health Department, whose director, Gary Mayes, offered praised Friday for the efforts. \u201cI think if the plan is executed as written, the race track will be very safe,\u201d Mayes said. Others are more skeptical. \u201cMy experience with plans like these is that they all sound really good when you first write them down, and then you go to actually put them into practice, and you have all kinds of problems,\u201d said Tara Kirk Sell, a scholar at Johns Hopkins University\u2019s Center for Health Security and an assistant professor at the university\u2019s public health school. Sell has followed the effort of American sports to try to resume under public health restrictions. Holding an event with social distancing measures in an outdoor venue like BMS would make more sense in a country that has its outbreak under control, she said. Sell pointed to ongoing issues with access to timely testing and effective contact tracing as the types of barriers that should create some caution before welcoming 30,000 into an event. \u201cI just don\u2019t think we\u2019re in a spot where we can do these types of things right now,\u201d Sell said. According to a recently released scale that ranks activities for their COVID-19 risk level, going to a sports stadium is a high risk, ninth on a scale of one to 10. Other activities ranked ninth on the scale, released by the Texas Medical Association, were going to a bar, movie, gym or concert. Activities like opening the mail was ranked at a one, low risk, while traveling on a plane was at seven, a moderate-high risk. Impacts beyond the track As thousands travel to Bristol for Wednesday\u2019s race, interactions between visitors from outside the region and the local community also present new opportunities for infection outside the speedway. \u201cIt\u2019s going to greatly increase the risk to our community for COVID-19 spread,\u201d said Karen Shelton, the director of the Mount Rogers Health District in Southwest Virginia. \u201cThe race track itself may have a great plan in place, but the rest of the community has to deal with 30,000 people in the community between hotels and restaurants and all the things that go on.\u201d Sifri, at UVa, noted the climbing case numbers in several states across the South where fans might be coming from, like Tennessee, North Carolina, Georgia and Florida, a coronavirus hot spot. This is part of the public health risks surrounding the event, he said. \u201cPart of the calculation of risk is the factors that we\u2019ve talked about: the close contact, crowded conditions, if you\u2019re in a closed space,\u201d Sifri said. \u201cBut it\u2019s also, how much fuel is there to potentially feed a fire?\u201d Jerry Caldwell, executive vice president and general manager at BMS, cautioned in an interview that the speedway estimates a significant number of attendees \u2014 about 40% \u2014 will be from the local region. Wednesday\u2019s race is also more scaled back compared to traditional NASCAR events at the track, which involve multiple events over a series of days. \u201cThis is essentially a one-day show,\u201d Caldwell said. \u201cA lot of these folks that are coming in, it\u2019s going to be much like what happens every single day now. I mean, we live at the intersection of [Interstates] 81 and 26. We have lots of people stopping on a daily basis visiting gas stations and restaurants when they\u2019re traveling through the area. We\u2019re going to have a lot of folks doing that same kind of thing. They\u2019re going to be coming in for the event, and they\u2019re going to be heading back to wherever they live.\u201d Mayes, with the Sullivan County Regional Health Department, acknowledged the concerns about potential transmission between race attendees and community members and said businesses need to make sure patrons wear masks, wash hands and follow social distancing guidelines. He said concerns about adhering to social distancing guidelines go beyond just the race. The county has faced issues with people traveling outside the area and bringing the virus back, Mayes said. Despite leading the county Health Department where the race is being held, Mayes said that he was not consulted on the decision to move the race from Charlotte to Bristol. The move was publicly announced June 15. Mayes declined to weigh in on whether his department should have been asked for input on the decision, but said the BMS plans \u201care very impressive from a safety standpoint.\u201d In an email Friday, Amanda Murphy, a spokeswoman for the Tennessee Economic Recovery Group, wrote, in part, that, \u201cWe are encouraged by the steps NASCAR and Bristol Motor Speedway are taking to mitigate risk to the community like requiring masks, digital ticketing, physical distancing and operating at a greatly reduced capacity.\u201d Murphy also pointed to the efforts of local leaders asking residents to follow social distancing guidelines and said the business community is being asked \u201cto implement strong measures to protect their employees and customers.\u201d A spokesperson for the Tennessee Department of Health did not return inquiries Friday seeking comment about concerns raised about the event and whether there are any reservations about holding the race amid recent rises in new coronavirus cases. Given the risks surrounding the race, McCullers, with the University of Tennessee Health Science Center, was critical of the event being allowed to move forward. Federal or state authorities should have stepped in to prevent it, he said. \u201cThis is really a failure of the government,\u201d he said. Caldwell, for his part, has said the track knows that hosting the event \u201ccomes with great responsibility.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re encouraging all of our guests when they\u2019re out in the community, to respect our community and wear a mask and practice social distancing and the safety measures that are appropriate and in place,\u201d he said. On Friday, as recent spikes in COVID-19 cases led Ballad Health to resume its regular media briefings on the virus for the first time in weeks, officials at the regional health care provider faced questions about the race. \u201cI think it could be a great thing for our region from an economy standpoint, but at the same time we have to make sure we\u2019re taking all the precautions we can,\u201d said Eric Deaton, Ballad\u2019s chief operating officer.","439":"After a relatively calm weekend in the world of college sports, headlines flew in from around the country starting Monday morning. The Patriot League, an FCS conference, announced it won\u2019t play sports this fall due to COVID-19. The conference joins the Ivy League, which made that decision official last week. Also last week, the Big Ten and Pac-12 announced they will only play conference games this fall. Late last week, the ACC announced an impending decision, saying it will share more information on the fall sports season at the end of the month. In less bleak news, the Maxwell Football Club announced its watch list for the Chuck Bednarik Award, which is given annually to the best defensive player in college football. Two Wahoos made the watch list, and they\u2019ll look to become the first UVa winner of the award since its inception in 1995. Both of UVa\u2019s players are on the watch list come from the linebacker position. Senior Charles Snowden and junior Noah Taylor made the list. In total, 18 ACC players earned spots on the watch list, including six linebackers from the conference. There are 90 players on the list and 20% of them come from the ACC. That\u2019s the most of any conference. Interestingly, Virginia is the only program in the nation to put two linebackers on the list. Snowden finished last season with 72 tackles, 11 tackles for loss and five sacks. Taylor racked up 57 tackles, including an impressive 13.5 tackles for loss and seven sacks. Both players use elite length to disrupt plays. They combined to break up eight passes a season ago, and Taylor finished the year with two interceptions. Zane Zandier, arguably UVa\u2019s most productive linebacker in 2019, didn\u2019t make the watch list. The Cavaliers\u2019 linebacker group is among the most talented and experienced in the country entering the upcoming season. ACC media days postponed After announcing in June that ACC football media days would move online, the conference announced Monday that even the virtual event scheduled for July will be postponed. Originally scheduled to take place July 21-23, the virtual ACC Football Kickoff media event is postponed indefinitely. \u201cAny future decisions and announcements will take place at the appropriate time,\u201d the press release said. The news isn\u2019t surprising. The story of the event would\u2019ve been COVID-19, and with the league set to make an announcement at the end of July on how COVID-19 will impact fall sports, a three-day virtual event prior to the announcement makes little sense. When it comes to fall sports, uncertainty looms. Harvey to transfer RJ Harvey, an athletic backup quarterback from Florida, announced his intention to transfer Sunday. Virginia head coach Bronco Mendenhall shared that expectation in March, but Harvey made it official over the weekend. \u201cThank you UVa football for allowing me to be a part of a hardworking program,\u201d Harvey wrote on Twitter. \u201cAfter much thought and conversations with my family, I have decided to enter the transfer portal with four years of eligibility. This is the best thing for me to become successful.\u201d Harvey was a freshman in 2019, and he didn\u2019t appear in any games. He joined Virginia as a three-star recruit with exceptional rushing ability. The Florida native scored 48 touchdowns his senior year of high school, with 25 coming on the ground.","440":"The sanitizing materials are then left on surfaces for a predetermined amount of time to ensure they dry and have their desired sanitation effect. It sounds like an alternate reality. On the surface, the protocols appear futuristic and extreme. To those inside, it\u2019s exactly what\u2019s needed to attempt to safely play college football amid the COVID-19 pandemic. \u201cIt\u2019s an amazing operation that\u2019s happening here,\u201d Virginia\u2019s head coach said. The operation, which began last week after Virginia football players arrived on grounds for voluntary workouts, includes much more than disinfecting the weight room following a lift. During those lifts, players are broken into small groups to ensure proper social distancing practices can be followed. Due to the small size of each group, workouts span from roughly 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. as players cycle through their lifts. Players wear masks during workouts. \u201cIt\u2019s more challenging,\u201d Mendenhall said of working out in masks. \u201cA lot of times, that\u2019s how you train for altitude training, but it\u2019s harder to breathe and it\u2019s hotter, so we\u2019re working hard to keep our players safe and have them become fit at the same time.\u201d When they\u2019re not working out, players stay in a series of dorms on grounds. \u201cThere\u2019s one exit, one entry into the dorms,\u201d Mendenhall shared. \u201cAnything that\u2019s after hours, you have a checkpoint there monitoring anyone in and out. Players are masking and social distancing.\u201d Visitors aren\u2019t allowed. That means family, friends and even teammates should not visit players in dorms. There are common spaces, however, which are set up outside. This allows players to interact at a safe distance, diminishing the potential spread of the virus while allowing human interaction. Meals are picked up at a tent outside before players take those back to their rooms. To get over to the McCue Center for lifts, players can walk or drive in a vehicle with three teammates. The walk takes about 15 minutes from their dorms. According to Mendenhall, the drive spans roughly three minutes. Since this falls below 15 minutes of time spent within six feet of other people, it\u2019s allowed according to the team\u2019s protocols. Once players arrive at McCue, they scan a code which then shows them a few questions related to COVID-19. Assuming players respond with satisfactory answers and haven\u2019t recently felt symptoms or been exposed to the virus, the door opens. A trainer waits just inside the door, taking each player\u2019s temperature while they socially distance in line. If the temperature is appropriate, the player receives a wristband. The color varies each day \u2014 Mendenhall wore a white wrist band Monday \u2014 and the band gives you access for the day. The protocol is then repeated the next day. Locker room access is nonexistent. Players show up to McCue wearing their clothes for the workout. Once it concludes, they had back to the dorm where they\u2019re allowed to shower. Laundry takes place using an outside drop-off point. \u201cIt\u2019s a giant operation we have going,\u201d Mendenhall said. \u201cOur support has been amazing. We\u2019re adjusting as we go. It\u2019s taking a lot to this point, but I\u2019m really encouraged by the people we have and the effort they\u2019re putting in.\u201d Division I college football is no joke. Neither is COVID-19. Both the sport and the virus demand attention. Unfortunately, the attention often competes. When it comes to preparing for football, close contact with peers is critical. When it comes avoiding COVID-19, close contact with peers represents the exact opposite of what\u2019s recommended. As UVa prepares for the potential fall season ahead, it\u2019s trying to figure out how to safely prepare for a contact sport while mitigating potential spread of the virus. \u201cIt\u2019s very challenging right now to acknowledge the threat of the virus, acknowledge the possible risk the players we love and care about are under and then ask them and ask them appropriately to condition and become ready for this game that\u2019s challenging to prepare for even under normal circumstances,\u201d Mendenhall said. \u201cWe\u2019re all feeling kind of an internal turmoil of asking, but not asking too much, and trying to keep players safe, but not at the expense of being prepared.\u201d","441":"On paper, the Virginia football team\u2019s season begins on Sept. 7 with a Labor Day showdown against an elite Georgia team. Bronco Mendenhall and company start the season with a crack at an SEC power. In reality, that Sept. 7 date sits precariously on Virginia\u2019s schedule. If you\u2019re keeping track of college football schedules on your calendar, mark the dates down in pencil. Schedule changes are likely to be frequent over the next month. With COVID-19 still a major threat in the U.S., the college football season may not take place this fall. If it does, it\u2019s a guarantee to look different than a typical season. A handful of options are available for college football in the coming months, and there\u2019s still time left to decide what works best. 1. Conference-only schedules Unfortunately, the option of playing the season as originally planned is gone. The Big Ten and Pac-12 already announced the decision to play conference-only schedules this season. Virginia head coach Bronco Mendenhall hopes the ACC does something similar. \u201cBy playing teams only in our region, only in our conference, we have a better chance to have standardized protocols in terms of testing,\u201d Mendenhall said. \u201cWe have a better chance to lessen cross-country travel. We have a better chance to mitigate any concerns about lack of consistency because we are in conference. There\u2019s already been suggested models about how that might work, but anything that reduces travel, reduces air travel, increases proximity play and keeps our players safer, I\u2019m for that.\u201d If the ACC opts for conference-only play, it can mandate certain COVID-19 testing procedures and safety protocols. In theory, if UVa traveled to play Clemson, both squads would be following identical health protocols, which would give each team peace of mind that they\u2019re doing all they can to remain safe amid the pandemic. Playing a team from a different conference makes it challenging to ensure that they\u2019re following the same safety protocols. Another suggested benefit of the conference-only format is reducing cross-country travel. In UVa\u2019s case, removing nonconference games doesn\u2019t reduce travel much at all, though. The team is scheduled to play Georgia in Atlanta and Old Dominion in Norfolk. VMI and UConn would come to Charlottesville. While the trip for UConn likely requires a flight, the other trips aren\u2019t overwhelmingly long. UVa is scheduled to play Georgia Tech on the road, so a flight to Atlanta remains on the current schedule even if Georgia is removed. Given that the ACC spans from Boston College to Miami, the schedule would need to be altered to truly reduce travel. 2. Regionalized conference-only games One potential proposal is playing home-and-home games with a handful of ACC foes. For example, Virginia could face teams in its region twice during an unusual 2020 fall season. Yes, that would likely mean facing Virginia Tech twice in one season. \u201cThis is a time for innovation and unique solutions doing the very best we can through the circumstances, and I think that proposal has merit,\u201d Mendenhall said. \u201cI\u2019d much prefer to play each team once, not twice, but again, that expands the regional play. I think that probably puts us at more risk than local play, and so the regional pod idea, it might be what the best thing is for us this year.\u201d While UVa\u2019s head coach doesn\u2019t want to play teams twice, it\u2019s a potential solution to reduce travel and ensure standardized testing protocols among teams. From a football perspective, watching Virginia face teams like Virginia Tech or North Carolina twice in one season would be fun. From a coaching perspective, trying to beat a top-25 caliber team twice brings plenty of challenges. 3. Regionalized nonconference and conference games While less likely than a conference-only scenario, there\u2019s sound logic behind playing regional foes even if they fall outside the ACC. For example, if Old Dominion follows testing protocols that UVa deems standard, that\u2019s an easy FBS matchup within driving distance. FCS teams like JMU, Richmond and William & Mary are all close to Charlottesville. VMI sits on UVa\u2019s current schedule. For those FCS teams, the payout from those matchups could help keep their athletic departments from facing drastic cost-cutting measures. VMI is set to earn $375,000 from Virginia if that game takes place. JMU has a scheduled road trip to North Carolina worth $500,000. There are also FBS options within Virginia and options with FBS teams just outside Virginia. The drive from Charlottesville to Morgantown, West Virginia, is about four hours. Could the Cavaliers add the Mountaineers to the schedule? If the ACC works out an agreement with the SEC or Big 12 regarding testing protocols, there\u2019s the possibility of games between those conferences working. The same goes for Group of 5 leagues like Conference USA. Games against Old Dominion and Charlotte are within driving distance of Charlottesville. \u201cI would prefer divisional play and crossover, as close as possible in terms of scheduling within our league,\u201d Mendenhall said. \u201cIf for some reason we couldn\u2019t get that architected correctly, yes, I would play regional games regardless. If for some reason we couldn\u2019t get it designed properly within conference, the next-best option is then to look at who\u2019s closest and then consider those options as possible non-conference, but I prefer conference first.\u201d 4. Move college football to the spring There\u2019s a possibility college football moves to the spring. The logic behind this solution would be that in the spring testing would improve across the country. The hope is also for improved treatments for COVID-19 with additional hope that a vaccine or multiple vaccines would be available by the spring. Moving to the spring could lead to a safer season. On the other hand, playing in the spring brings serious health questions into play. Could a player realistically play 10 or more games in the spring before then turning back around and playing a full season in the fall of 2021? The physical toll could be too much to handle. There\u2019s also no guarantee that it\u2019s dramatically safer to play in the spring than it will be in the fall. While this solution sounds great in theory, it\u2019s much more challenging in practice. It is a potential solution, but it\u2019s not perfect. 5. Cancel the season Nobody wants to consider this option. Unfortunately, there is a possibility college football doesn\u2019t take place this fall. If too many hurdles come up in the spring, the next college football game could come in the fall of 2021. This is the worst-case scenario. 6. Other considerations Mendenhall wants a season, even if it\u2019s different than normal, to last at least eight games. \u201cAnything less than eight I don\u2019t think would be appropriate to ask of them,\u201d Mendenhall said. \u201cSo that\u2019s the minimum cutoff I have internally just based on my own threshold, nobody else\u2019s. Anything more than that I think would be worth it, anything less hard to justify, knowing that I understand the revenue part, I understand, man, the athletic department\u2019s need for resources. I understand the effect on other sports, and so I want to help that at the highest level as well.\u201d It\u2019s important to note that players want to play. Coaches want to coach. Fans want to watch games. It needs to be done safely, but everyone involved wants a healthy and safe fall season. Unfortunately, the virus dictates most of the decisions. Wanting a fall season isn\u2019t enough to make it happen. If the numbers with the virus improve, fall football in an altered form is a possibility. If not, it\u2019s hard to fathom a fall college football season. Regardless of the uncertainty, UVa\u2019s staff and players plan on preparing for a fall season until told otherwise. \u201cWe still have to anticipate and prepare as if we\u2019re opening on time,\u201d Mendenhall said. \u201cSo, it might be like a special forces unit or a unit that\u2019s training and preparing and ready to get a green light to be called on the mission but you\u2019re never sure if the green light\u2019s actually going to go on. It might stay red. You have to be ready as if it\u2019s going to go off at any time.\u201d","442":"The high-profile matchup features the reigning SEC East champions and the reigning ACC Coastal Division champions. After a special season, Virginia\u2019s matchup with Georgia gives the Cavaliers a chance to open the season with a marquee victory. Unfortunately, COVID-19 is threatening to postpone or cancel that game, which is part of a week-long Chick-fil-A kickoff series featuring three nonconference showdowns. On Saturday, Sept. 5, West Virginia is set to play Florida State. Virginia faces Georgia on Monday, Sept. 7, and North Carolina squares off with Auburn on Saturday, Sept. 12. Last week, the Big Ten and Pac 12 announced they would play conference-only schedules in the fall due to COVID-19. Fortunately, all six of the teams in the kickoff event play in the ACC, Big 12 or SEC. Those conferences are expected to announce their fall football plans at the end of the month. There\u2019s a chance those leagues try to keep the Chick-fil-A kickoff matchups alive. \u201cWe are in a process of waiting until the conferences decide at the end of this month, the ACC and the SEC and the Big 12 what their decisions are going to be,\u201d said Peach Bowl, Inc. CEO and President Gary Stokan, who is in charge of running the Chick-fil-A kickoff series. \u201cAre they going to push back the schedule? Are they going to play conference-only? Are they going to play conference plus one? We\u2019ve modeled a lot of different scenarios and sent that off to the conferences, hoping that we can get our Chick-fil-A kickoff games.\u201d Stokan stressed that the decision is up to the conferences, and student-athlete safety is paramount in the decision. Whatever happens, safety comes first. One possible scenario includes conferences maintaining a few of the ACC and SEC rivalry games while moving to conference-only matchups outside of those games. That\u2019s what Stokan calls the \u201cconference plus one\u201d format. For example, Florida would still play Florida State and Georgia would still play Georgia Tech. In this example of a conference-only season plus one nonconference game, UVa would lose its matchup with Georgia. The Bulldogs would instead play Georgia Tech and all SEC games. West Virginia would lose its game against Florida State with the Seminoles facing Florida instead. \u201cIn that scenario we\u2019ve said, \u2018OK, we can match up West Virginia vs. Virginia in our Chick-fil-A Kickoff game since they\u2019re both scheduled to be there in Atlanta, and then continue with our North Carolina-Auburn game the next week, September 12,\u201d Stokan said. The event has also modeled different seating possibilities. Can the venue allow 25% of people? How about 50%? Would masks be required of all fans? Would bags be allowed into the stadium? Other aspects, like bands and cheerleaders also need to be considered. It\u2019s been a hectic few weeks and months for the event staff trying to determine how it might work to safely play the three football games. \u201cGod bless my staff, they\u2019re the best in the business,\u201d Stokan said. \u201cWe love challenges, and that\u2019s one of the reasons we took on three games a week. You just accept the challenge and you start to model a lot of different scenarios.\u201d Despite the modeling, Stokan and his staff know they aren\u2019t in charge. COVID-19 leads the way, with the conferences making decisions based off the virus. The kickoff event follows the conference decisions. If the event can happen safely, there would likely be restrictions for things like the College Football Hall of Fame, VIP areas and the fan zone. An event that usually garners plenty of attention and fanfare may require dramatic limits on fan interactions and activities. There\u2019s also the distinct possibility the event doesn\u2019t happen in the fall. If football moves to the spring, Stokan hopes to keep the matchups for the spring season. Stokan hopes the games can occur safely this fall. Atlanta is one of the largest convention towns in the country, and the three games would be considered three of the seven largest conventions in the city, according to Stokan. He estimates the economic impact to Atlanta if all three games are canceled at about $100 million. \u201cIt\u2019s quite devastating to the hospitality industry should we not be able to have these three games as well as college football fans because this will be one of the first events back on the TV schedule for sporting events,\u201d Stokan said.","443":"For baseball players, summers after college seasons are filled with more organized baseball. Collegiate summer leagues are abundant throughout the country. For softball players, it\u2019s a much different story. While several Virginiaa baseball players are competing in summer leagues in states like Texas, Wisconsin and Virginia, softball players largely don\u2019t have access to the same summer league competition. \u201cBaseball has much more opportunity to play in the summer than softball for sure, and it\u2019s been like that for a long time,\u201d UVa softball head coach Joanna Hardin said. \u201cThey\u2019re just so much more established and often connected with different coaches that are in college and high school.\u201d The lack of softball summer leagues makes some sense. There are significantly fewer professional softball leagues \u2013 and they don\u2019t draw the same widespread interest or media coverage as professional baseball. Summer leagues are used to improve for the college season, but they\u2019re also a pathway to the professional level. \u201cI know for baseball those opportunities really allow and open up for practicing and playing for preparation for the draft, so it\u2019s a little bit different,\u201d Hardin said. While a lack of professional leagues may be the cause of the limited summer leagues, it doesn\u2019t mean there isn\u2019t tremendous interest in the game. ESPN saw dramatic increases in viewership in college softball viewership in 2019, according to a recent article from Front Office Sports. The Women\u2019s College World Series was the most-watched WCWS since 2015, the network saw the most viewers for Super Regionals since 2008 and the best regular-season viewership since 2016. The 2019 WCWS championship series averaged 1.57 million viewers, and the 15-game event averaged 1.1 million viewers. ESPN made a commitment to showing college softball both on television and its streaming platforms in 2020 before the season was canceled due to COVID-19. Creating an emotional attachment to a college team is easier than a professional team, as many fans attend or attended the university\u2019s team they support. Regardless, there\u2019s a market for softball, especially at the collegiate level. It\u2019s reasonable to think the creation of a few summer leagues could benefit collegiate players and teams in their development. The Florida Gulf Coast League launched a collegiate summer softball league this summer, which is allowing some of the top collegiate players a chance to compete. In future summers, more leagues may develop. In the meantime, players like UVa ace pitcher Aly Rayle finds herself home in Northern Virginia, competing with current teammate Kate Covington and others to stay sharp. \u201cIt\u2019s been a lot of practicing on my own, but I have some teammates living in my area, so we meet up and I pitch to them when I can,\u201d Rayle said. \u201cThen there are some friends and alumni from my high school or travel ball that I used to play with that I\u2019ve been connecting with to practice, but it\u2019s been a little bit difficult, a lot of practicing by yourself.\u201d When she can\u2019t meet up with someone, Rayle pitches alone. She bought a net to stop her pitches, while also providing her with a target. \u201cI drove around for about an hour when I first got home to find a field that wasn\u2019t locked up, and I just prop up my net, bring my bucket of balls and throw by myself on the field,\u201d Rayle said. That\u2019s not the same as competing against Division I-caliber hitters, but it\u2019s better than nothing. Given the lack of summer leagues and the pandemic, keeping skills sharp poses a challenge for all softball players. With the rising popularity of college softball, it remains to be seen if summer leagues will become more widespread. With so few professional leagues, it makes it challenging for collegiate softball players to commit an entire summer to something that might not lead to future paychecks. \u201cJust knowing the very, very limited amount of professional leagues, you really have to decide how to spend your time,\u201d Hardin said. \u201cDo I go internship? Do I do summer school?\u201d Determining how to spend a summer is a tough decision for college students, and for many softball players, a summer league option isn\u2019t even on the table yet. Depending on what athletic activity is allowed this fall, the sport rising in popularity will enter the 2021 spring season having potentially gone close to a year without consistent collegiate competition.","444":"Fans hoping to see collegiate sports this fall saw a mixed bag of news Thursday. The University of Virginia announced more details on its plans to return students to grounds for in-person instruction this fall, while conferences across the country announced delayed or canceled fall sports. With the end of July approaching, it\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess as to whether fall sports will actually take place this fall. For the time being, however, UVa is pressing forward with its fall plans. Virginia\u2019s Thursday announcement about returning to Grounds in the fall included a few relevant pieces of information for UVa sports fans. First, UVa still plans on returning to grounds this fall. That\u2019s critical if the Cavaliers are going to have fall sports. The Daily Progress reported earlier this week that some officials in Charlottesville, including the mayor, were concerned about UVa students returning to grounds in the fall. With more than a month until classes start, questions remain about if the plan will be put into practice in August or if COVID-19 spikes nationwide will cause a change of plans. For the time being, it appears Virginia will attempt to have in-person instruction. Second, there will be a handful of protocols in place that will alter the traditional life of a student-athlete. Students will wear masks in classes. Physical distancing is required. There will also be 2,600 hand-sanitizer stands in high-trafficked areas. It\u2019s going to be an unusual fall in the classroom. That will impact student-athletes, who hope to compete on the field while also taking classes in person. It\u2019s going to be a mental adjustment in the classroom for student-athletes. Women\u2019s basketball returns Tina Thompson\u2019s program announced Thursday that it has returned to Grounds. The women\u2019s basketball team joins the women\u2019s soccer team and the football team as programs to announce they\u2019ve returned to Grounds. The football team had two positive COVID-19 test results out of its initial 110 tests. The athletic department hopes for similarly low positive test percentages as other programs arrive on Grounds. Expect other programs to officially announce their arrival in Charlottesville over the next 10 days. Return-to-sports guidelines The NCAA issued additional return-to-sports recommendations Thursday. Those include daily self-health checks for athletes, the use of face coverings and social distancing when training and testing strategies. It\u2019s recommended that high-contact sports test athletes and receive results within three days of competition. While the plan is aimed at a safe return to play in the fall, it\u2019s far from a guarantee. \u201cThis document lays out the advice of health care professionals as to how to resume college sports if we can achieve an environment where COVID-19 rates are manageable,\u201d NCAA President Mark Emmert said. \u201cToday, sadly, the data points in the wrong direction. If there is to be college sports in the fall, we need to get a much better handle on the pandemic.\u201d Conferences delay fall sports Several conferences outside the Power 5 leagues announced changes to fall sports competition Thursday. The Horizon League won\u2019t participate in athletic competition until Oct. 1. The West Coast Conference moved the start of its fall season to Sept. 24 at the earliest. The MEAC announced the cancellation of fall sports. The Big East removed all nonconference competition from fall sports schedules. While the Power 5 leagues kept announcements to a minimum, several of the lower-level leagues made changes to fall seasons. Academic honors Outside of COVID-19 news, the UVa men\u2019s basketball team finished the 2019-20 season with a team GPA at or above 3.0. With the achievement, the Cavaliers earned 2019-20 National Association of Basketball Coaches Team Excellence honors.","445":"The last time the Virginia softball team won the ACC championship, its current players weren\u2019t born. It\u2019s been nearly three decades since the program reached the top of the ACC in 1994, but the Cavaliers want to return to that level. They want to become a national force. Their goal entering the 2021 season is to win the ACC. While winning the conference shouldn\u2019t be a shocking goal, what makes the goal interesting is UVa\u2019s willingness to tell the world about it. The Cavaliers posted a video to social media on May 15 with the caption \u201cOne Goal \u2013 The ACC Title.\u201d The tweet also included the projected date, May 15, 2021, of the ACC Championship. The Cavaliers announced their goal of winning the conference title to everyone. \u201cThe goals have always been like just be better and get better and growth mindset and see growth,\u201d Virginia head coach Joanna Hardin said. \u201cWe felt that it was time to say, we need to put something pretty audacious forward that we can actually really pursue. We understand it\u2019s been 27 years and hasn\u2019t happened in a long time.\u201d Hardin admitted it\u2019s a lofty goal. In her three full seasons leading the Cavaliers, Hardin\u2019s group has gone 20-52 in ACC games. In the shortened 2020 season the Wahoos were 0-6 in league action. Taking a step from a below .500 team to an ACC champion is a major jump. Fortunately for the Cavaliers, they have the pieces to make an improvement. Virginia only had one senior on its 2020 roster. While Riley Wilkinson won\u2019t return, the Cavaliers bring back an abundance of contributors. Aly Rayle, a sophomore in 2020, leads the way as the team\u2019s returning ace. She impressed in 2020, tossing 57 2\/3 innings and posting an ERA of 2.91. She struck out a team-high 74 batters. Rayle likes what the Cavaliers return in 2021. \u201cWe\u2019re all really excited and eager to get after it,\u201d Rayle said. \u201cI think it\u2019s really helpful to have such a high goal and such a clear goal and know what we\u2019re aiming for. It really puts everything that we\u2019re doing in context and unites us all to fight for that, so it\u2019s been great so far.\u201d Molly Grube, a freshman in 2019, also logged successful innings. She tossed 46 1\/3 innings and finished the year with a 3.63 ERA. The Cavaliers hope to develop additional depth outside those two players. At the plate, the Cavaliers return everyone. Sophomore Donna Friedman was particularly impressive in 2020, smashing three home runs and batting .324. Freshmen Tori Gilbert and Katie Goldberg both also launched three home runs in 2020. Virginia\u2019s lineup returns with years of eligibility remaining. While winning the ACC still seems like a rather lofty goal, there are reasons for optimism for the Cavaliers. They recently opened their new facility and stadium, and the team features talented underclassmen. \u201cIf we fall short, evaluate where we\u2019re at and what not, but it\u2019s time to put something pretty big on the line,\u201d Hardin said. Unfortunately, COVID-19 makes the pursuit more challenging. How will the Cavaliers develop at home without softball summer leagues and unknowns about how much they\u2019ll be able to practice this fall? Wanting to win a league without spending time developing as a team makes the future exceptionally challenging. The Cavaliers believe they\u2019re up for the challenge. \u201cI think this summer is going to be a real difference maker,\u201d Hardin said. \u201cDo we use our time to grow and get better or are we just kind of waiting around? I\u2019m confident that our girls are really using the summer to grow.\u201d","446":"Malcolm Brogdon headlines a talented group, with Joe Harris and Mike Scott also expected to receive significant minutes. A few other former Wahoos are in the bubble and may earn minutes, depending on injuries and positive COVID-19 tests. Let\u2019s check in on the latest headlines regarding the Wahoos in the NBA bubble. Brogdon practices, wears maskIndiana Pacers point guard Malcolm Brogdon, a former UVa star, tested positive for COVID-19 a few weeks ago. He joined the team in Orlando recently, and he\u2019s working out with his teammates in preparation for the return to action. Brogdon, who averages 16.3 points and 7.1 assists per game, practiced in a mask Thursday as he returned to workouts. \u201cHe is out there working hard, he\u2019s playing with a mask on, and that\u2019s pretty much Malcolm\u2019s doing just to give the team confidence that he\u2019s not out there spreading anything,\u201d Pacers head coach Nate McMillan said in a video interview with reporters. \u201cHe\u2019s not required to play with a mask, but he\u2019s been working that way the last two days.\u201d The point guard expects to continue wearing the mask in practice until game action begins. Indiana\u2019s first regular-season game back in action is set for Aug. 1, although the team has a few exhibitions in the coming days. \u201cI intend to do it until we start playing games,\u201d Brogdon said. \u201cIt\u2019s something I\u2019ve been doing for my conditioning and just to be considerate of the guys. Just in case guys are worried about me previously contracting the virus.\u201d When it comes to Brogdon\u2019s conditioning, there\u2019s room for improvement. Not only has he been out of NBA action since the season was suspended in March, but Brogdon also battled injuries prior to the shutdown. He hasn\u2019t suited up in a game since March 4. Add in a few weeks of self-isolation due to a positive COVID-19 test, and Brogdon\u2019s conditioning falls short of his goals. \u201cMy conditioning is not where I want it to be, of course, it\u2019s not NBA shape, but it\u2019s actually better than I thought,\u201d Brogdon said. \u201cI\u2019ve heard a few people say that I\u2019ve looked in more shape than they thought I would after two, three weeks sitting down, so I\u2019m happy where I\u2019m at.\u201d Of the 48 games Brogdon played this season, all 48 were starts. He averages 30.7 minutes per game. Brogdon plays frequently, and he\u2019s an important part of Indiana\u2019s roster. He\u2019s hopeful he\u2019ll return to game shape in the coming days. \u201cI\u2019m not satisfied, and I\u2019m pushing myself every day in practice, my teammates are pushing me,\u201d Brogdon said. \u201cI\u2019ll definitely be in shape by the time games start.\u201d As for life in the NBA bubble, Brogdon says he can\u2019t complain. While some players posted complaints regarding their rooms or the food online, Brogdon says he\u2019s grateful to join the bubble. People are struggling physically, mentally and financially due to the pandemic. Brogdon wants to keep the \u201cstruggles\u201d of the bubble in perspective. \u201cThere are people here working extremely hard to make this as comfortable for the NBA players as possible, so it\u2019s not my job to complain or insult food or do anything like that,\u201d Brogdon said. \u201cThe food has been good. The food has been enough. We just got to be grateful.\u201d Nets sign Anderson Reports surfaced a few weeks ago that the Brooklyn Nets would sign Justin Anderson for the NBA restart. The team made the news official Saturday night. Anderson previously appeared in three NBA games for the team this season and also played 16 games for the team\u2019s G League affiliate, averaging 20.5 points per contest. He joins former UVa standout Joe Harris on the roster.","447":"Across the spectrum of collegiate athletics, few universities excel at the same level as Virginia. From an improving Power 5 football program to a top men\u2019s basketball team to elite men\u2019s and women\u2019s lacrosse programs, UVa\u2019s athletic department sits among the nation\u2019s most successful. Olympic sports such as swimming and diving showed tremendous potential in 2019-20, and other programs such as wrestling and cross country find themselves in the mix nationally. A few programs, however, have room to grow to become relevant on the national stage. One of those programs is softball, which finished a shortened 2020 season below .500. The Cavaliers expect a much better 2021 campaign, and with a group of talented youngsters, dramatic improvement could be on the way in future seasons. Last season\u2019s results UVa finished the 2020 season 10-12 overall and 0-6 in ACC play. The Cavaliers were competitive in their first 12 games before fading for a stretch against increased competition. After starting 8-4, the Cavaliers went 0-6 in conference games while also dropping a pair of nonconference games, including a 10-3 loss to James Madison in the first game at Palmer Park. Virginia ended the season with two wins over Bucknell. Despite poor conference results, the Cavaliers competed well in their losses. The effort level rarely dipped, and that\u2019s something the Cavaliers hope to bring into 2021. \u201cThe one thing I saw from our team was a lot of feistiness, and we never gave up in any game,\u201d pitcher Aly Rayle said. \u201cI think that\u2019s something that\u2019s really valuable about our team.\u201d UVa performed adequately against weaker foes, picking up a few wins and showing poise. Against ACC competition, the results worsened. The Cavaliers were competitive against Clemson despite being swept, but a three-game sweep against Virginia Tech was tough. UVa failed to score in any of the games against the Hokies. Rayle believes the Cavaliers were close to finding their rhythm when the season ended abruptly due to COVID-19, and she liked how willing her teammates were to look closely at mistakes to fix them. It\u2019s hard to assess a softball team on a shortened 2020 season, but the Cavaliers clearly possessed talent. They also needed improvement to compete with top 25-caliber programs. \u201cThere\u2019s a desire to just get better,\u201d UVa head coach Joanna Hardin said. \u201cWe\u2019re not really worried about who said what and how, we just want to get better.\u201d Notable departures The team\u2019s one departure is pitcher Riley Wilkinson. The Princeton graduate transfer is heading to Louisville to attend graduate school. Wilkinson brought a strong, veteran presence into the circle. Her leadership will be missed, although Wilkinson didn\u2019t contribute as much as other pitchers in the circle. Other pitchers, like Rayle, logged more innings and were given most of the meaningful innings. UVa losing just one player bodes well for the team\u2019s 2021 chances. Notable returners Just about everyone. Virginia returns its ace, Aly Rayle. Kate Covington will be among the team\u2019s elite hitters. Donna Friedman broke onto the scene as a top hitter in 2020 before the season was canceled. Hardin will enter the spring of 2021 with a deep and young roster. There\u2019s talent at each position, but it remains to be seen if the team can turn youth into victories in a competitive league. Rayle helps tremendously. A sophomore in 2020, Rayle finished the season with a 2.91 ERA across a team-high 57 2\/3 innings. If she can improve \u2014 18 pitchers finished the 2020 season with an ERA of 1.00 or under in 2020 \u2014 the Cavaliers can take a step forward. Pitching means everything in college softball, and the best teams want an ace with an ERA under 2.00. At season\u2019s end, LSU\u2019s roster included four pitchers who logged at least 35 innings and finished the season with an ERA of 1.30 or lower. The Tigers were widely regarded as a top-10 team in 2020. Outside of Rayle, Molly Grube is an important pitcher. She finished her freshman season with a 3.63 ERA across 46 1\/3 innings. Grube showed potential as the No. 2 pitcher behind Rayle. If she can drop her ERA to below 3.00, it takes pressure off Rayle. Of the 295 Division I softball teams listed on the NCAA\u2019s website, UVa ranked 164th in runs per game. The Cavaliers scored just 14 runs across six conference games, and they failed to score at all in a three-game series with Virginia Tech. UVa needs much more production at the plate. Fortunately for the Cavaliers, plenty of returners make that a realistic possibility. Friedman smashed three homers and hit .324 in 2020. Covington joins Savana Avila as the veterans of the group. Avila led the team in doubles with five in 2020. Tori Gilbert and Katie Goldberg \u2014 both freshmen in 2020 \u2014 were productive at the plate to begin their collegiate careers. \u201cI think our rising second years have a much better understanding, and I think that\u2019s already been passed along to our incoming class, like they\u2019re already champing at the bit and ready to go, which is really exciting,\u201d Hardin said. As a team, UVa hit .249 and launched 14 home runs. There were decent stretches at the plate, but improvement is needed against the best pitchers in softball. ACC play offers a challenge, and the young lineup needs a bit of development before making a mark against top-25 foes. Notable additions While the team\u2019s recruiting additions aren\u2019t official, the team does return to its new facility. Palmer Park gives the Cavaliers a top-tier stadium to compete. The conference rooms, locker room and training areas make for an ideal facility for an ACC program. After years of using facilities spread out across Grounds, the Cavaliers now have a central location for training and competing. It should help in recruiting, while also helping with day-to-day work. 2021 outlook The future looks bright for the softball program, but the group needs to turn its potential into a team capable of winning ACC games. The Cavaliers want to win the ACC championship in 2021. For that to happen, the team needs to improve in every aspect of the game. A young roster and new facility should excite Virginia softball fans, but it takes more than a tremendous new stadium and a few young stars to enter the top 25. UVa needs steady progress to become an elite ACC softball program. COVID-19 makes it unclear when the Cavaliers will return to practice in Charlottesville, but the team hopes to put in productive work on its own prior to its return to town. \u201cAll the uncertainty certainly is difficult, but I would say the one thing that we know we can keep constant is how hard we work,\u201d Rayle said. It might take a few years for UVa to reach the top of the ACC given the challenges of training amid COVID-19 and the team\u2019s current position among ACC programs. The 2021 season doesn\u2019t need to be perfect, but the Cavaliers do need to hold their own more consistently in conference games as they aim to take steps forward.","448":"Unfortunately, due to COVID-19, athletic departments are being forced to make less than ideal decisions. Several FCS conferences plan on playing football in the spring after bowing out of a fall season due to the virus. The Big Ten and Pac 12 moved away from nonconference action in the fall, announcing the plan to play only conference football games. That\u2019s if the leagues can safely play sports at all this fall. While college athletic departments grapple with how to approach fall sports, professional leagues continue resuming or starting their seasons. For example, the PGA Tour effectively restarted its season a month ago. Despite a few hiccups \u2014 including former UVa golfer Denny McCarthy testing positive for COVID-19 \u2014 the Tour has played multiple events without drastic COVID-19 impacts. Other leagues, such as the WNBA and NBA, are in Florida \u201cbubbles\u201d preparing for play to begin by the end of the month. UVa\u2019s Jocelyn Willoughby is set to make her WNBA debut Saturday. The NBA has reported zero positive COVID-19 tests since July 13. Major League Baseball found similar testing success, having just six of 10,548 tests since July 16 return as positive. Major League Soccer, which features a few former Wahoos, received zero positive tests out of the 1,106 people tested on July 18 and 19. The NHL, which will be playing in two \u201cbubbles\u201d in Canada, also is receiving low positive test rates. With professional leagues finding success in the early stages of returning to action, does that bode well for college sports in the fall? Not exactly. The college bubbl e Professional leagues creating safe \u201cbubbles\u201d is great news for sports fans. If the clean sites hosting games keep the virus out of the site, the seasons will likely finish without any issue. That means Virginia fans can sit back and relax while watching former Cavaliers like Willoughby, Malcolm Brogdon and others as they compete at the highest level. Fans can see Sean Doolittle pitch for the Nationals for the first time since winning a World Series. Unfortunately, college athletic departments can\u2019t create bubbles. Unlike the NBA or WNBA, college teams can\u2019t stay in the same location as their opponents. There\u2019s no realistic scenario where UVa and all of its football opponents stay isolated in the same town for two weeks prior to their game while also avoiding contact with the outside world and taking classes. The largest issue surrounding the return of college sports is the return to college itself. UVa\u2019s admission page says roughly 25,000 students were enrolled for the fall semester of 2019. Assuming that number remains accurate this fall, the university would bring 25,000 people into a community during a pandemic. While the school has safety protocols in place for students to follow prior to their arrival on Grounds, bringing that number of people into one community from different parts of the country and world comes with risk. Charlottesville Mayor Nikuyah Walker called the plans \u201ca recipe for disaster\u201d earlier this month. Once UVa attempts to compete in fall sports while holding in-person instruction, any possible bubble is popped. Virginia\u2019s student-athletes will interact with other students during a typical day, and unlike the professional sports leagues, the students won\u2019t be tested nearly as frequently as those within the professional sports bubbles. Creating a college sports bubble is close to impossible, and positive COVID-19 test results from students can have negative effects on the surrounding community if the cases lead to increased spread. \u201cToday, sadly, the data points in the wrong direction,\u201d NCAA President Mark Emmert said last week. \u201cIf there is to be college sports in the fall, we need to get a much better handle on the pandemic.\u201d Testing turnaroundAccording to reporting from The Athletic earlier this month, NBA tests take only 12 to 15 hours to process, and players, coaches, team personnel and media are all tested to keep COVID-19 out of the bubble. If someone tests positive, they isolate to ensure the virus doesn\u2019t spread. College athletic programs don\u2019t have nearly that level of speed in their testing turnarounds. The NCAA recently recommended testing results be received within three days of competition in high contact sports. Football certainly falls under the category of high contact. The 72-hour rule leaves plenty to be desired. If a player takes a test Wednesday night prior to a Saturday afternoon game, there\u2019s still ample time between the test and the game for them to be exposed to the virus. By the time kickoff rolls around, the test result could be irrelevant. It\u2019s clear that frequent testing with rapid results helps professional leagues play safely. It\u2019s highly unlikely college communities can reach the same level of testing frequency and match the turnaround time as those professional organizations. Lack of organizationPart of the allure of conference-only play is the ability to standardize testing and safety protocols across the conference. Virginia football coach Bronco Mendenhall supports the idea of conference-only play for that very reason. \u201cI just think there\u2019s a lot of variance right now,\u201d Mendenhall said of testing numbers and safety protocols. \u201cThere isn\u2019t a national consistency approach mandated from the NCAA or other conferences yet, and so with that any reporting you have to include variance within that.\u201d Mendenhall\u2019s team works out while wearing masks and following strict social distancing protocols. Disinfecting practices are in place as the program does everything it can to return to action safely. If other programs don\u2019t follow strict protocols, Mendenhall thinks it\u2019s fair to remove those programs from competition for safety reasons. \u201cNow that we\u2019re back, now we have another challenge, because they\u2019re closer together, we\u2019re sweating, we\u2019re breathing on each other, we\u2019re social distancing, we\u2019re wearing masks, we\u2019re doing everything we can to mitigate,\u201d Mendenhall said. \u201cI can only hope that others are doing that, and if they\u2019re not, I would love for them to be disqualified.\u201d Conferences and individual programs are left to make decisions regarding testing and safety protocols. There\u2019s a lack of standardization with safety protocols across college programs, whereas professional leagues are competing largely due to clear guidelines that apply to every athlete and team. The bottom line The UVa football program received two positive results out of its 110 initial COVID-19 tests. The initial starting point is encouraging. While initial numbers provide some information, they don\u2019t provide the full picture. College athletic programs can\u2019t create a bubble when thousands of students return and in-person instruction begins. Testing at the college level falls well short of the testing procedures at the professional level. Safe bubbles allow for the return of professional sports. Student-athletes, who aren\u2019t paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to compete, won\u2019t have the luxury of competing in those bubbles. UVa is doing about all it can to return to workouts safely, especially within the football program. \u201cI think they\u2019ve handled the masking, the social distancing, the hand washing, and some of the other protocols we have in place at a strong level,\u201d Mendenhall said. \u201cIt\u2019s not habitual yet and it\u2019s not truly a part of our culture yet, but I do believe the information that we gathered along the way from other programs, not only internally but externally, as our players were viewing it as we were viewing it and adapting and applying in our program, has allowed a really strong return and a strong initial starting point.\u201d It\u2019s a good start for the Wahoos, but maintaining good numbers when 25,000 people flock back to Grounds is an entirely different challenge. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll say initial because there\u2019s still a lot of work to do,\u201d Mendenhall added.","449":"That\u2019s good news for Virginia fans. Former Cavaliers find themselves in critical positions in several professional leagues ranging from the NWSL to MLL to the NBA. It\u2019s been an impressive few weeks for former Cavaliers competing among the professional ranks. NWSL Challenge Cup The Chicago Red Stars and the Houston Dash earned spots in the NWSL Challenge Cup championship match with semifinal victories Wednesday. That means five former UVa women\u2019s soccer players will compete for a championship Sunday in Utah. Chicago features four of those five former Wahoos: Danielle Colaprico, Makenzy Doniak, Morgan Gautrat and Zoe Morse. Veronica Latsko is the lone former Cavalier playing for the Dash. Houston punched its ticket to the final with a 1-0 win over Portland, while Chicago used a 3-2 win over Sky Blue FC to advance to the title match. The champion of the Challenge Cup will include at least one former UVa player on its roster. Sunday\u2019s championship starts at 12:30 p.m. ET. Guy shines in scrimmage The NBA\u2019s return-to-play effort has included a few scrimmages in Orlando. Kyle Guy logged eight minutes for the Sacramento Kings in a Wednesday night scrimmage against Miami. The former UVa men\u2019s basketball star scored five points on 2-of-3 shooting, while also adding a pair of assists. Guy flashed solid athleticism and looked the part of an NBA player despite spending much of the 2019-20 season in the G League. With the Kings 3.5 games out of the No. 8 seed in the Western Conference, they may opt to give Guy time in regular-season games to feel out his readiness to join the NBA roster. Keep an eye on Guy\u2019s minutes should the Kings quickly fall out of the playoff race or if a guard is forced to miss time due to an injury or positive COVID-19 test. Kraus scores first goal Former UVa men\u2019s lacrosse star Michael Kraus scored his first professional goal Wednesday in a Major League Lacrosse game. Kraus scored twice as the Connecticut Hammerheads took down the New York Lizards 10-8 for their first win of the eight-day tournament. The rookie also added an assist in Wednesday\u2019s win, the first of his professional career. Kraus and his team are guaranteed five games before potentially qualifying for Saturday\u2019s semifinals. McCarthy fires 68 After testing positive for COVID-19 in late June, former UVa men\u2019s golfer Denny McCarthy has returned to action and is trying to regain his form ahead of the FedEx Cup Playoffs. McCarthy opened this week\u2019s tournament with a 3-under-par round of 68. He finished the Memorial Tournament in a tie for 58th place last week. McCarthy has two missed cuts and withdrew from another event \u2014 due to COVID-19 \u2014 since the PGA Tour\u2019s restart. He\u2019s yet to crack the top 50 of a tournament since the resumption of play, but he\u2019s off to a good start this week with Thursday\u2019s performance. McCarthy hopes to regain his form from the fall, when he started the season with eight consecutive top-50 finishes, including three top-10s. Thursday\u2019s round could be a sign of good things to come. Watch list updates While not professionals yet, current UVa football players Terrell Jana and Dillon Reinkensmeyer earned spots on the Wuerffel Trophy watch list. The award goes to a player who serves others and inspires service. The watch list includes 114 FBS athletes.","450":"\u201cHappy belated birthday to you, Mike,\u201d a reporter said. \u201cMy question actually has to do with that. I feel like the 76ers have had the most bubble birthdays so far \u2026 so what are you guys doing right now for birthday celebrations?\u201d Scott, a former Virginia star and current member of the Philadelphia 76ers, celebrated his 32nd birthday on July 16. The 6-foot-7 small forward wasn\u2019t interested in chatting about birthdays, though. Scott had more important topics on his mind. He joined teammate Tobias Harris in using his media availability to ask for justice for Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old Louisville woman who was killed by police in March. Scott wants the officers who killed Taylor arrested. \u201cI appreciate the birthdays, and yeah, we definitely have a lot of birthdays, but I just want to continue to reiterate that Daniel Cameron, we\u2019re still waiting,\u201d Scott answered. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what\u2019s taking so long. We still want justice for Breonna Taylor\u2019s murder.\u201d Daniel Cameron is Kentucky\u2019s Attorney General. \u201cWe still want justice for Breonna Taylor \u2026 and that\u2019s it,\u201d Scott said. \u201cThat\u2019s gonna be my answer every time you guys interview me.\u201d Scott thanked the reporters for taking the time to join the Zoom call, which also included availability with Philadelphia head coach Brett Brown and center Joel Embiid. \u201cI appreciate everyone here that\u2019s doing their job,\u201d Scott said. \u201cIt\u2019s probably not the answers you all want, but at the end of the day that\u2019s all I\u2019m going to continue to keep saying. We want justice, and I just don\u2019t get what\u2019s taking so long.\u201d Earlier in the week, during Monday\u2019s media availability, Harris shared a similar sentiment. He took one question, asking for justice in Taylor\u2019s death, before exiting the media session. \u201cWe want to make sure that Daniel Cameron will arrest the cops and officers involved with Breonna Taylor\u2019s death, and that\u2019s all I got to say,\u201d Harris said Monday. In early July, Scott was critical of the NBA\u2019s plan to allow players to wear jerseys with short messages on the back instead of their last names. The league sent out a preapproved list of phrases for the jerseys, rather than allowing players to decide what they want on the back of their jerseys. He called the decision to send a preapproved list a \u201cbad miss.\u201d \u201cThey didn\u2019t give players a chance to voice our opinions on it, they just have us a list to pick from,\u201d Scott said in a previous media session. \u201cSo that was bad, that was terrible.\u201d Philadelphia finds itself in the playoff mix heading into the NBA\u2019s resumption of play in Orlando. Scott, who has been used largely as a reserve this season, will likely play a role in helping the team try to win a championship. While NBA games resume in roughly a week, there\u2019s more than basketball on the minds of players within the bubble. Scott, his teammates and others want justice for Taylor. On a larger scale, they want to action to help combat systemic racism in the U.S. Between COVID-19 safety protocols and social justice initiatives, the rest of the NBA season isn\u2019t just about basketball. For Scott and many others, more important topics than team birthday celebrations need to be addressed.","451":"The first game of the 2020 WNBA season features an experienced title favorite facing off against an up-and-coming squad with seven rookies. The Seattle Storm enters the year with championship aspirations, while the New York Liberty wants to develop for future success. When the two teams tip off Saturday at noon on ESPN, many eyes will be on Liberty rookie Sabrina Ionescu. The former Oregon star was the No. 1 pick in the 2020 WNBA Draft, and she\u2019s regarded as one of the best women\u2019s basketball prospects in recent seasons. While attention will be given to Ionescu, those in Charlottesville will be watching a different rookie. Former Virginia star Jocelyn Willoughby is expected to make her WNBA debut Saturday alongside Ionescu. \u201cI think, overall, it\u2019s excitement,\u201d Willoughby said of her emotions prior to her debut. \u201cThis is a game that I didn\u2019t know if it was going to happen for some period of time, and now it\u2019s getting closer, so definitely excitement overall.\u201d After being drafted by the Phoenix Mercury with 10th overall pick in the 2020 draft, Willoughby was promptly traded to the Liberty on draft night. The New Jersey native hoped to suit up for her hometown team in front of her family and friends. Instead, due to COVID-19, Willoughby will play her first career game in Bradenton, Florida, in the WNBA\u2019s \u201cbubble.\u201d There won\u2019t be any fans. \u201cIt\u2019s just going to feel a little bit different, but my mentality and preparation isn\u2019t necessarily going to be different,\u201d Willoughby said. After leading the ACC in scoring as a senior during the 2019-20 season, Willoughby plans on preparing like she has for the past few seasons at UVa. She\u2019s a physical player with solid court awareness and a smooth jump shot. She can score in a variety of ways, and she rebounds at a high rate. Defensively, Willoughby performs well thanks to quick feet and noticeable strength. Her game translates well to the next level. Willoughby feels confident in her game heading into the start of the 22-game season. She wants to improve on making reads offensively, but after practices and scrimmages, she feels good about how her athleticism translates to the WNBA level. \u201cI think physically I\u2019m pretty ready for this league,\u201d Willoughby said. \u201cI\u2019ve prepared for this, and so I think a lot of players mention like it\u2019s a huge transition in terms of the build and strength of players. So far that hasn\u2019t been too much of a shock or a big transition for me, so I\u2019m thankful for that.\u201d Entering the season in one single location makes for an unusual rookie season. Willoughby does get to experience the same odd season alongside six other rookies, though. She\u2019s certainly not alone in trying to find her footing in the WNBA. Head coach Walt Hopkins, who is entering his first season as a WNBA head coach, likes the way his young team handles adversity. It hasn\u2019t been an easy few months to prepare for the season in Florida, but the players embrace the struggles of the 2020 season. \u201cThis whole thing is going to be a challenge, but this group, the way that they\u2019ve responded to anything we\u2019ve asked and to the challenges we\u2019ve had so far \u2014 which honestly are pretty formidable, not us in particular but everyone here \u2014 it\u2019s been really impressive,\u201d Hopkins said. Few WNBA experts expect many wins from the Liberty in 2020, but the extremely talented and young roster looks the part of a future contender. There\u2019s plenty of time for the squad to develop, but even with tempered external expectations, some first-game jitters are sure to come out Saturday. Willoughby has never played a game in the WNBA, and her first game atmosphere won\u2019t allow fans into the facility. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be a typical game,\u201d Willoughby said. \u201cThere\u2019s not going to be any fans. It\u2019s not in normal circumstances.\u201d The \u201cnot knowing\u201d gives Willoughby some anxiety, but she\u2019ll likely settle into a groove after a few minutes on the court. An increased focus on social justice during the 2020 WNBA season also makes for a slightly atypical season. Courts are expected to display the message \u201cBlack Lives Matter.\u201d Other measures, like jerseys displaying Breonna Taylor\u2019s name, will be part of the opening weekend plans to bring awareness to racial injustice in the U.S. Taylor was killed in March by Louisville police officers. COVID-19, racial injustice and basketball will all be on Willoughby\u2019s mind as she makes her way through her rookie season. It\u2019s going to be a rookie season unlike any other, and she\u2019s ready for everything that comes with being a professional athlete in the summer of 2020. \u201cI think in some ways it\u2019ll be emotional given that this season is dedicated to more than just basketball,\u201d Willoughby said of her debut. \u201cWith the moment of silence before the game and just having that moment of reflection, so I\u2019m sure there\u2019s gonna be a lot of emotions tied to it, but overall excitement to get back to basketball and looking to compete and put on a good performance.\u201d","452":"None of the student-athletes required hospitalization. No information was provided as to whether the athletes that tested positive showed symptoms. The football team has 112 student-athletes who have received tests since returning on July 5 and three tests were positive. The program previously announced testing 110 student-athletes and receiving two positive test results. According to UVa\u2019s release, the men\u2019s basketball, women\u2019s basketball, field hockey, football, men\u2019s soccer, women\u2019s soccer and volleyball program are all back on Grounds. The programs hope fall and winter athletic seasons can be performed safely. Given the football testing results, 123 student-athletes outside of the football program have been tested for COVID-19 and only one student-athlete produced a positive test result. \u201cI think it\u2019s pretty clear that our student-athletes did a good job at quarantining prior to their return,\u201d Dr. John MacKnight, UVa athletics\u2019 medical director and primary care team physician, said in an interview. \u201cThey were very responsible about managing themselves beforehand, and then since they have been here they similarly have done what we have asked of them to be responsible for their own care and to be responsible for those around them.\u201d MacKnight is UVa\u2019s representative on the ACC\u2019s COVID-19 medical advisory group. The student-athletes who tested positive must self-isolate for at least 10 days. If symptoms persist past the 10-day mark, they self-isolate until symptoms go away and they go three days without a fever. Close contacts of athletes who test positive are asked to self-quarantine for two weeks. \u201cThe contact tracing, quarantine element of the protocol that we have in place right now, to me is arguably the biggest challenge that we face in trying to pull off the season because you may have a relatively small number of student-athletes who were actually ill, but you may lose a very large number of student-athletes because they were in close proximity to those few individuals who were sick,\u201d MacKnight said. With ACC athletic competition delayed until at least Sept. 1, self-quarantines during the next two weeks won\u2019t drastically alter competition. Future positive tests will lead to players sitting for two weeks due to contact tracing, barring a change in protocols from UVa or the ACC. Given the current protocols, if a quarterback tests positive for COVID-19 in early September, and he\u2019s interacted in close proximity to the other quarterbacks, every quarterback would be forced to self-isolate for roughly two weeks. That could leave a team without a quarterback for multiple games. UVa\u2019s numbers remain promising, although plenty of uncertainty remains. The athletic department plans on providing additional periodic testing updates prior to the start of fall seasons.","453":"During Pat Harbeson\u2019s junior year at Virginia, a group of students from Harlem Lacrosse visited Charlottesville. The experience left an impact on Harbeson. \u201cI think what kind of really stood out when they first visited was the fact that you\u2019re looking at low socioeconomic families and kids, but the group specifically that came down wasn\u2019t your traditional lacrosse team,\u201d Harbeson said. \u201cIt was filled with a bunch of boys who were mixed race; they were Black or Latino, which was very different than the standard, stereotypical lacrosse player.\u201d Harbeson, a biracial athlete adopted into a white family, experienced racism growing up, but he also experienced certain privileges. He comes from a military family, and he moved around as a child, which helped him learn and appreciate different cultures. Following George Floyd\u2019s death, Harbeson knew he wanted to take action. He saw the racial unrest nationally and wanted to use his platform as a biracial athlete. He also wanted to ensure his words and actions led to meaningful outcomes. \u201cI looked at it and I said, \u2018What can we tangibly do to make a change?\u2019\u201d Harbeson said. Ultimately, Harbeson decided to donate money to Harlem Lacrosse, a nonprofit organization which empowers student-athletes through lacrosse and mentoring. For every groundball Harbeson picks up during the Premier Lacrosse League\u2019s two-week tournament, which began Saturday, he\u2019ll make a donation to Harlem Lacrosse. The former Virginia athlete, who won a national title in 2011, wants to help those in less fortunate situations. The organization predominantly helps students of color. \u201cI think everyone kind of looks at these low socioeconomic cities in America and they point fingers saying, \u2018All this violence and negativity occurs in these spots, and for me it\u2019s like, \u2018OK, so let\u2019s go into these cities and try to uplift them and equal the playing field and try to assist and help out,\u2019\u201d Harbeson said. Harbeson\u2019s coach at UVa, Dom Starsia, serves on the Harlem Lacrosse Executive Board and is the one who brought the Harlem Lacrosse group to Charlottesville during Harbeson\u2019s junior season. The legendary coach is passionate about Harlem Lacrosse\u2019s mission and execution. \u201cMost of the time when you think about organizations like this, you think about an after-school program, and that\u2019s not who we are,\u201d Starsia said. \u201cWe are a school-by-school program, so when Harlem gets involved with a school, we put a full-time person in the school.\u201d The full-time staff members help students with most aspects of their lives. Reaching practice after school comes as a reward. Students first need to ensure they arrive at school on time and take care of their school work. Having a full-time staff member in the school allows the staffer to mentor the student on a daily basis and in situations outside of the lacrosse field. Lacrosse plays a key role in the development of the students, but it\u2019s not the only focus. The organization\u2019s efforts hit home for Starsia, whose father was a New York City police officer. \u201cHarlem was always a mysterious place growing up,\u201d Starsia said. \u201cIt touched me, Harlem Lacrosse did, in a lot of different ways.\u201d Starsia loves the organization\u2019s work \u2014 the nonprofit has expanded to cities outside the New York area in recent years \u2014 and he loves the UVa connections. Former Cavaliers have worked at the nonprofit, and the program\u2019s founder, Simon Cataldo, earned a law degree from UVa. \u201cI particularly enjoy the fact that the Virginia guys are very active, doing what they\u2019re doing,\u201d Starsia said. \u201cIt\u2019s great to see what Patrick is stepping up and doing here.\u201d For Harbeson, the fundraiser comes at an important time. With COVID-19 impacting organizations across the country, Harlem Lacrosse is among those feeling the financial hit. Fortunately, Starsia and others reached out to the lacrosse community, and the organization has had more than 2,000 new donors in the past three months. Harbeson\u2019s fundraiser should add to that total. A few players, including former Virginia star Adam Ghitelman, and lacrosse organizations reached out to Harbeson on social media after his announcement. Some players will donate to Harlem Lacrosse based off their own stats, while others will match Harbeson\u2019s final donation. \u201cI\u2019m hopeful that more guys jump on board, and it kind of just catches like wildfire the way that social media can run,\u201d Harbeson said. \u201cI\u2019m super excited. I\u2019m thankful for guys like Joel Tinney and Adam Ghitelman for jumping on board and getting involved. It\u2019s a real tangible way we can make change in people\u2019s lives.\u201d With the coronavirus pandemic and racial unrest nationally, it\u2019s been a challenging time. The impact of both the pandemic and the racial tension is felt by those within Harlem Lacrosse. Harbeson\u2019s fundraiser helps the nonprofit during a difficult time financially and mentally. \u201cIt\u2019s everything,\u201d Starsia said. \u201cWhat I have learned in my lifetime \u2014 42 years coaching college lacrosse and now four or five years out of coaching \u2014 what I used to say and what I used to take for granted is that it is about the relationships. It is. I\u2019m very grateful for the fact that we won some championships and we have that, but when I see guys like Patrick being a success and giving back to the community, it means everything, frankly.\u201d Starsia hopes his former player fills up the stat sheet the next two weeks. \u201cWhat I think should happen this weekend is when Patrick\u2019s playing one of these games that\u2019s been decided, people should roll him the ball and knock it out of his stick and roll it back to him again,\u201d Starsia joked. \u201cMake him pick it up like 10 times in one short sequence. Let\u2019s empty his bank account.\u201d","454":"In late June, Clemson announced that 37 of its 120 football players tested positive for COVID-19. Immediately, some fans wondered whether those numbers may benefit the Tigers ahead of fall college football. Could Dabo Swinney\u2019s squad develop herd immunity? The answer to that question isn\u2019t a simple yes or no. UVa athletics\u2019 medical director and primary care team physician, John MacKnight, says the concept of herd immunity is legitimate, but the understanding of immunity when it comes to COVID-19 is insufficient. \u201cThe herd immunity piece, I think is a very important concept, because I think ultimately when people ask about, \u2018How do we get ourselves out of the pandemic situation that we\u2019re in?\u2019 The answer is really twofold,\u201d MacKnight, Virginia\u2019s representative on the ACC COVID-19 medical advisory group, explained. \u201cOne is a high-quality vaccine, where you can basically force people to have immunity by stimulating that response internally and then the other is herd immunity where either frank illness or at least exposure to the virus, even without illness, generates an antibody response that is presumed to be protective over time.\u201d Herd immunity exists, and it requires either a vaccine or exposure to the virus and the subsequent development of antibodies. Unfortunately with COVID-19, some data suggests immunity can be short lived. MacKnight says recent research suggests immunity may only last about three months. Following the three-month window from recovery, the antibody response fades. \u201cSo that\u2019s not exactly the way we want it to go, and it\u2019s certainly not what we expect of our immune system,\u201d MacKnight said. \u201cOnce you\u2019ve seen the virus you, at least in theory, should mount a protective antibody response that we hope is much longer lasting.\u201d He does wonder if current antibody testing fails to give an accurate picture of immunity within our bodies. MacKnight thinks there\u2019s a possibility our bodies produce stronger antibody responses than tests reveal. More research is needed to truly understand how our bodies respond to the virus. If immunity only lasts about three months like some research suggests, it means there\u2019s the potential for reinfection of individuals who already contracted the virus. Given the relative lack of experience treating and studying COVID-19 in relation to other viruses, it\u2019s hard to know exactly how immunity works as of late July. UVa performed antibody testing on athletes when they arrived back on Grounds \u2014 the athletic department does blood work already, so the antibody test was added to typical work \u2013 and few athletes had antibodies, according to the tests. That\u2019s interesting data, but it doesn\u2019t change much about the athletic department\u2019s plans to handle athletic activity amid the pandemic. \u201cI don\u2019t think we know yet whether we can tell individuals who have been sick, or who have been exposed, that they can\u2019t necessarily get sick again, or that they\u2019re not susceptible and even with the antibody testing \u2026 it\u2019s interesting data to get, but I\u2019m not sure we can make that interpretation yet to solidly or confidently tell someone if you have antibodies then you\u2019re OK and you\u2019re not going to put other people at risk,\u201d MacKnight said. \u201cI don\u2019t think we have enough information yet to support that.\u201d What\u2019s that mean for college sports, including football? Well, UVa currently operates under the assumption that immunity lasts for three months. If a player tests positive, they then undergo the athletic department\u2019s safety protocols. This includes 10 days of self-isolation and tests to determine that an athlete has recovered from the virus once symptoms go away or the 10 days pass. Only after team doctors approve the return to athletic activity is an athlete allowed to compete and practice following a positive test. After that point, there\u2019s an assumption that the player will have immunity for three months. \u201cThe general sense is, at least for the three months where we know that people have antibodies, we are assuming that they are protected and that they\u2019re OK and so that the likelihood of passing it to others is little to none and that the likelihood of acquiring it again is essentially zero and so we carve out the three-month window for them,\u201d MacKnight said. \u201cOnce they\u2019ve gotten past that point, then they will resume, if their sport is still going, the weekly screening testing like everyone else would do prior to competition, and if they were subsequently contact traced by the health department after that point, then they would serve a 14-day quarantine just like everybody else.\u201d During the three months of assumed immunity, athletes are not included in the weekly screenings, and they aren\u2019t required to quarantine for two weeks if a close contact tests positive for COVID-19. The concept of herd immunity within athletic programs becomes problematic given the length of seasons. For example, if the football season starts in September, athletes who tested positive for COVID-19 and recovered in mid-July will return to the weekly screening process in approximately mid-October. This means the immunity won\u2019t last throughout the duration of the season. Additionally, and more importantly, there are unknowns about potential long-term effects of the virus. Trying to intentionally develop herd immunity would place athletes at risk of developing long-term complications. Even as teams unintentionally develop immunity, it\u2019s still not ideal for players to test positive for COVID-19. It\u2019s also important to note the potential effect of positive cases within communities. While student-athletes may not show severe symptoms, they could spread the virus to vulnerable people within the community. That could lead to increased illness and strain on a community\u2019s medical resources. It\u2019s in the best interest of student-athletes and their surrounding communities to avoid contracting the virus. \u201cI think at this stage one of the things that we really struggle with \u2014 although it seems like we\u2019ve been dealing with this illness for a long, long time \u2014 in the grand scheme of things the United States, we\u2019re just over four-plus months of time,\u201d MacKnight said. \u201cSo I think we really have to be conservative and we have to be smart because we simply don\u2019t have enough data at this point to know truly what the natural history of the illness is and what the impact on these young people will be.\u201d","455":"With the championship game between the Houston Dash and Chicago Red Stars set for 12:30 p.m. ET, at least one former Wahoo is guaranteed to hoist a trophy by the end of the weekend. If Houston wins, Veronica Latsko\u2019s squad earns the title. If Chicago wins, Danielle Colaprico, Makenzy Doniak, Morgan Gautrat and Zoe Morse become Challenge Cup champions. The Red Stars feature the most former Cavaliers of any team in the event. After about a month in Utah competing in the tournament and living in one location, the championship arrives. That\u2019s good news for Latsko, who has felt the mental and physical toll of playing in the single-site event. \u201cI can tell you that it definitely doesn\u2019t feel like a month,\u201d Latsko laughed. \u201cIt kind of feels like four months that we\u2019ve been here for and I think any player that you talk to will kind of say the same thing. We feel like we\u2019ve been here for a very long time.\u201d Competing in games while living in one location with limited activities makes for a challenging month. On the other hand, Latsko loves her team and the journey the Dash has taken to reach the final of the tournament. \u201cWe have an awesome team and awesome people on the team that spending time with everybody makes the time here fun and enjoyable, so that\u2019s really great,\u201d Latsko said. \u201cOn top of that, we\u2019ve had incredible success. Obviously, when you\u2019re winning everything is 10 times better than when you\u2019re losing.\u201d After dropping a pair of games early in the tournament, the Dash stepped up once elimination games began. The team advanced to the semifinals after a penalty kick victory over Utah. A 1-0 win over Portland in the semifinals punched the squad\u2019s ticket to the championship game. Chicago\u2019s tournament went similarly. The team lost twice in its first three matches before reaching another level. The group used penalty kicks to advance to the semifinals before an offensive explosion in the semifinals. The Red Stars scored three goals in a 3-2 victory over Sky Blue FC to advance to Sunday\u2019s final. With the Challenge Cup wrapping up, the event has largely been seen as a success. In addition to quality play, the NWSL became the first team sport in the U.S. to compete during the COVID-19 pandemic. MLB, the WNBA and the NBA are just beginning to play games, while the NWSL has competed since late June. It hasn\u2019t been a perfect event \u2014 Orlando was forced to withdraw days before the event due to positive COVID-19 tests within the team \u2014 but once in the Utah bubble, the Challenge Cup has gone smoothly. \u201cI have several conversations that I\u2019m hoping to have with governors or mayors that we might be looking at because I want to show them what we did in Utah and how we worked with the Utah state and local officials to make sure that our protocols and our ability to be in a place conformed to them,\u201d NWSL commissioner Lisa Baird said in a press conference Friday. The league developed a five-phase plan in its return to action, and Baird hopes the league\u2019s successful tournament can serve as a guide for other leagues and localities as professional sports resume. Despite the difficulty of remaining in a single location, Latsko and others felt confident in the league\u2019s health protocols throughout the tournament. \u201cWe feel super safe here,\u201d Latsko said. \u201cThe bubble might have its challenges mentally, but it\u2019s the best way to keep us safe. I think everybody feels very safe here.\u201d A successful tournament wraps up Sunday afternoon and at least one former UVa soccer star will leave the Utah bubble as a Challenge Cup champion.","456":"\u201cIt is hard for me to sit down and write this, but as of today, I have officially tested positive for COVID-19,\u201d Kitts wrote on Twitter. \u201cI want to be as open as I can about it in hopes that my experience can help others.\u201d Kitts went on to detail his recent weeks and the experiences that led up to him contracting the virus. \u201cI live in a small town and have just been to a few restaurants,\u201d Kitts wrote. \u201cI assumed that there would be no way that I would test positive in a town this small. I still have no clue where I contracted it, but I still did.\u201d The tight end\u2019s symptoms are mild. He says the symptoms started with headaches and dizziness, but it wasn\u2019t overwhelming. He eventually started sleeping more and felt like he needed to take naps. Just before the weekend, he lost his sense of smell and taste, which is a common symptom of COVID-19. That urged him to get tested for the virus. The test came back positive. \u201cNone of those symptoms can compare to the guilt and worry I feel though,\u201d Kitts said. \u201cI worry for the other people in my family, anyone I have come in contact with, and myself. As of now everyone else has tested negative in my family. The only thing I can do now is isolate and pray for a full recovery.\u201d Kitts has been with UVa for three seasons, starting in 2017. He\u2019s yet to appear in a game for the Cavaliers.","457":"A few years ago, Marques Hagans took up running. The former Virginia football player and current wide receivers coach wanted to get into better shape, and he started regularly running 2-3 miles alone around Charlottesville. The inner competitor in Hagans was sparked after going for a run with his brother-in-law and sister-in-law a few years ago. \u201cThey just smoked me, it wasn\u2019t even close,\u201d Hagans laughed. \u201cAt about two miles, they were so far ahead of me. It was embarrassing. At that moment, I was like, \u2018Alright, I\u2019m gonna get serious about this.\u2019\u201d Hagans started to run longer distances, working his way up to about 10 miles. When quarantine began due to COVID-19 and the football team remained at home instead of returning to Charlottesville for spring practice, Hagans found even more time to run. The coach and a group of friends and former teammates started tracking their runs using the Nike Run Club app. Hagans called the first month of using the app introductory, but by the second month, it became a friendly competition to see who could run the most. \u201cEvery morning you woke up like, \u2018Alright, what did somebody do last night?\u2019 or \u2018What did somebody do this morning?\u2019\u201d Hagans said. As everyone in the group improved their fitness, the length of the runs and the average speed per mile became tougher to beat. \u201cDudes were logging like 8-10 miles a day,\u201d Hagans said. \u201cIf you wanted to win, you had to start running like 10-12 miles a day, and that\u2019s when it really picked up during quarantine, and once I got to 12 I was like, well I\u2019ll try 16. Once I got to 16, I was like let\u2019s try 20, and once I got to 20 I was like, let\u2019s go for 26.\u201d He went for 26.2 miles, the length of a marathon, on July 18. Hagans finished the run in four hours and 38 minutes, according to a tweet he sent after the run. With the football team back in town, Hagans woke up before the sun and finished the marathon before starting his work day. \u201cWe have workouts at 9:20, I started at 4 o\u2019clock in the morning, and then as soon as I finished, hopped in the shower and went right out to coach the guys and I went about the rest of my day,\u201d Hagans said. Hagans admits finishing the marathon wasn\u2019t easy, and the journey to become a long-distance runner comes with struggles. When he first started running, Hagans could barely finish a mile. Despite the challenges, Hagans likes striving for a goal. His wife, Lauren, challenged him to get in the best shape of his life once quarantine started. The former UVa women\u2019s basketball player is a healthy eater and active person, Marques said, and that helps motivate him to eat well and stay active even with COVID-19 restrictions. He also credits his kids for encouraging him when he\u2019s set to take on particularly long runs. Since the start of quarantine, Hagans has dropped 20 pounds and currently weighs in at a lean 190 pounds. While personal fitness is part of Hagans\u2019 goal, he runs for more than himself. He wants to inspire others to live an active lifestyle, and he believes running offers physical and mental health benefits. One of the people motivated by Hagans is Ahmad Hawkins, Hagans\u2019 friend and a former UVa football player. Hawkins took up running about a year ago, and he\u2019s gone from seeing himself as a sprinter to running 5-10 miles consistently. \u201cThat\u2019s my brother, I love him and he\u2019s family,\u201d Hawkins said. \u201cI\u2019d do anything for him. Just seeing what he\u2019s doing for the program being a coach and being a great mentor, he inspires me all the time.\u201d Hawkins particularly admires the example Hagans sets for the current Virginia football players. The coach ran the distance of a marathon prior to a July practice, and it\u2019s clear he doesn\u2019t expect more from his players than he does of himself. \u201cIron sharpens iron,\u201d Hawkins said. \u201cA lot of times you see folks encouraging the next class, but they don\u2019t live what they\u2019re talking, and we just try to be that example and try to push ourselves.\u201d In addition to motivating the football team, Hagans and Hawkins want to motivate people in Charlottesville to run and remain fit. Hagans, who played a few seasons in the NFL, wants to keep himself healthy and change the stereotypes around fitness and health. \u201cPart of it, too, is just trying to change the narrative, especially as a former athlete and Black male in America,\u201d Hagans said. \u201cA lot of times there\u2019s so many different health disadvantages that we have. A lot of times guy get overweight from playing football in the league, and they depend on substance abuse.\u201d If he inspires just one person, Hagans says his fitness efforts are worth it. The former UVa standout and Hampton native didn\u2019t know much about running growing up. It wasn\u2019t popular in his community, but he\u2019s seen the Charlottesville community embrace running and its benefits. He wants to be a key part of that movement. \u201cGrowing up in my neighborhood, I never saw dudes running,\u201d Hagans said. \u201cNow we\u2019ve got all kinds of guys running through Charlottesville and across the country. It\u2019s a cool thing to be a part of, running to raise awareness for health, mental health and just trying to change the narrative.\u201d When others come to Hagans for running advice, he\u2019s quick to clarify he\u2019s not an expert. \u201cI just didn\u2019t quit,\u201d Hagans laughed. \u201cI just kept going.\u201d Even though he still considers himself a running novice, Hagans has a few years of running experience under his belt. He\u2019s added a marathon to his running resume, and he\u2019s taking suggestions for his next running challenge. In the meantime, he does offer one piece of advice for those motivated to run by his social media posts. \u201cThe couple things I would recommend are you got to learn to control your breathing, you got to learn to control your mind,\u201d Hagans said, \u201cand you got to find a comfortable pair of tennis shoes to run in.\u201d","458":"Taking COVID-19 tests a few days prior to Saturday games, attending online classes and wearing masks are just a few examples of how this fall college football season might look completely different than years past. If \u2014 and it\u2019s a big if \u2014 the fall college football season can occur safely, it\u2019s going to look different. It needs to look different. With the coronavirus still a threat, everything from attendance limitations to frequent COVID-19 tests are needed for the season to occur. In addition to low case numbers in communities, a safe season also requires buy-in from players. They need to socially distance and wear masks when applicable to limit their exposure to the virus. \u201cThis is going to be player-driven,\u201d UVa head coach Bronco Mendenhall said earlier this month. During required activity, players were spending about two hours per day with the team. NCAA rules allowed that hourly limit to increase to four hours per day and 20 hours per week starting Friday. There\u2019s significant time each week when the players are not being coached and supervised by team personnel. \u201cThe individual and social choices and commitment of our players to each other is what will drive the success or failure of this initiative,\u201d Mendenhall said. \u201cThis can\u2019t be managed into success. This is personal choice, based on commitment to team.\u201d Mendenhall believes empathy, \u201cmaybe even more than science,\u201d will be the key to success. The long-term effects of COVID-19 on college-aged students are unclear, and while student-athletes might not be the most at-risk group to suffer life-altering impacts from the virus, spreading the virus into a vulnerable population requires concern. Players don\u2019t want to contract the virus, and they certainly don\u2019t want to spread it within the Charlottesville community. For a season to take place, it\u2019s critical that players avoid contracting the virus. That\u2019s a little bit easier during offseason workouts, when the majority of the student body is away from Charlottesville. \u201cAs we get close to playing, obviously their daily routine is going to look a lot more like football,\u201d John MacKnight, UVa athletics\u2019 medical director and primary care team physician, said. \u201cSo there\u2019s going to be a lot of close contact in practice and then of course school will be back in session. You\u2019ve got individuals who are going to class, individual upperclassmen who will be returning to their apartments and non-bubble lives. That\u2019s where the challenge is going to be in ensuring they\u2019re doing everything they can to continue to mitigate risk in spite of the fact they\u2019ll be out of the neat bubble we\u2019ve got here for the summer workout time.\u201d Without the bubble, mitigating risk becomes a major challenge. One option for players hoping to limit exposure to the virus is to take some classes online. While UVa hasn\u2019t recommended this for athletes, it\u2019s a possibility that could make sense for players wanting to avoid contact with other people. \u201cMy gut sense is that most of the kids at this point are looking at the online options as relatively more appealing as long as they can still meet the demands that they have academically and not detour themselves from their course work,\u201d MacKnight said. \u201cWe have not made any across-the-board recommendations to do that as a means to preserve sport. They all understand what the implications are there, and I suspect as their course of academic work will allow they\u2019ll take advantage of that as much as they reasonably can.\u201d If students return to Grounds by the thousand, there\u2019s not much student-athletes can do to limit exposure outside of social distancing, wearing masks and making smart decisions. Avoiding large off-campus gatherings will be important. When it comes to Saturdays in the fall, only players who test negative for the virus earlier in the week will be allowed to play. The NCAA recommends testing players within 72 hours of competitions requiring close contact. Off the field, attendance will likely be severely limited. Teams could move to regionalized schedules with the ACC playing a mostly conference-only slate. If a fall football season happens, it\u2019s going to look drastically different than what we\u2019re used to seeing. Expect more clarity regarding the fall season soon, with the ACC planning an announcement by the end of the month. If the ACC decides to play football this fall, the fate of the season isn\u2019t solely up to the players, though. It requires a relatively healthy community and an ample supply of medical supplies and ICU beds in local communities. \u201cI think the other sort of unfortunate reality is if we reach the point where we\u2019re critically challenged in regards to testing supplies and testing capability and it\u2019s putting a strain on the Health System, probably sports at that point are not going to be a priority,\u201d MacKnight said. \u201cIt may already be the circumstance then where the institution has decided we did the best we could but we simply can\u2019t pull this off.\u201d","459":"Now that the Virginia High School League has finalized its plans for high school sports for the 2020-21 athletic year, some Central Virginia football players are weighing their playing options. On Monday, as part of its return-to-sports plan, the VHSL Executive Committee voted to move the high school football season to the early spring for this upcoming school year due to the COVID-19 pandemic. That could mean some of the top high school prospects in the state may not suit up for their teams this season. One of those prospects is Louisa County running back Robert Morgan IV, who said Monday that he will not play his senior year with the Lions, electing instead to enroll in college early. \u201cAfter talking with my parents, I\u2019ve decided to enroll at Howard University in January,\u201d Morgan said. \u201cMy parents and I just decided it was best to start my college education early.\u201d The rising senior recently verbally committed to join the Howard football program and reunite with former backfield mate Jarett Hunter. He sat down with his parents two weeks ago to discuss enrolling early, just before the VHSL Executive Committee announced its three return-to-sports proposals, none of which included playing football in the fall. Morgan had a breakout year for the Lions last fall before he tore his anterior cruciate ligament in the regular season finale against Albemarle. He will be the latest Louisa County football player to graduate high school early to get a jump-start on playing college football, joining former teammates Brandon Smith (Penn State) and Noah Robinson (Old Dominion). Morgan said the VHSL\u2019s vote had no impact on his decision to forgo his senior year of high school football. \u201cIt was difficult, because I felt like I had more to prove to myself from getting hurt at the end of the regular season,\u201d he said. Covenant senior athlete Jonas Sanker and Monticello quarterback Malachi Fields face similar decisions. Sanker has won Virginia Independent Schools Football League 8-man championships at Covenant the past two seasons. Covenant recently announced that it will not field a varsity football program for the 2020 season due to low participation numbers. That leaves Sanker, a University of Virginia commit, with a difficult decision. He contemplated transferring to a public school to prepare himself for playing 11-man football at the college level. But after the VHSL\u2019s announcement Monday, Sanker, who also is an all-state point guard for the Eagles\u2019 basketball team, said that he will remain at Covenant for the time being. \u201cIf there are no fall sports in [public schools], I will be at Covenant in the fall,\u201d Sanker said. \u201cThere is a chance I\u2019d transfer in the spring to play public school football.\u201d Fields, who, like Sanker, is a UVa commit, planned to play out his senior year at Monticello, regardless of the VHSL\u2019s decision. \u201cI am super excited to play,\u201d Fields said. \u201cThis is senior year and it\u2019s time to ball out. I hadn\u2019t planned on enrolling early, so this doesn\u2019t change anything.\u201d The Mustangs\u2019 senior quarterback is expected to be an impact player once again in the Jefferson District under first-year coach Matt Hicks. He\u2019s excited about the opportunity. \u201cI\u2019m just glad we get to have a season, even if it\u2019s not in the normal season,\u201d Fields said. \u201cI\u2019m excited to play. It\u2019s going to be weird playing at a different time of year, but I\u2019m ready to get into it and see what the season brings for me and my teammates.\u201d","460":"College athletes dislike sitting at home. For many Division I athletes, they\u2019ve gone most of their lives without the amount of free time they\u2019ve experienced since March. From practices to games to schoolwork, most of these athletes find themselves constantly on the go from their childhood through college. COVID-19 changed that for many University of Virginia athletes. Instead of spending time taking classes in person while practicing their respective sports, they were sent home. Free time was spent working out, finishing up classwork and, in many cases, binging Netflix shows. Boredom doesn\u2019t mesh well with collegiate athletes and creative ways to stay busy are quickly put into place. Sarah Billiard, a rising senior for the UVa volleyball team, spent part of quarantine putting her brothers to work. She wanted to keep her game sharp despite the absence of team activity, so she enlisted the help of her brothers as playing partners. \u201cMy brother plays football and my other brother plays basketball, so they\u2019re tall, so they can move quickly and they\u2019re agile, but as far as their technical skills, a little lacking,\u201d Billiard laughed. Fortunately for Billiard, she\u2019s back on Grounds with her teammates in anticipation for a fall volleyball season. Her playing partners are much more experienced in Charlottesville, and she\u2019s about a month away from ramping up athletic activity and classwork. Volleyball joins football, both basketball programs, both soccer programs and field hockey as UVa sports to return to Charlottesville in recent weeks in preparation for upcoming seasons. \u201cI\u2019ve been at home for the past few months, and just the drive back was such an adrenaline rush because it meant that we were gonna play volleyball soon,\u201d Billiard said. \u201cI know that everybody\u2019s just so excited.\u201d During the time off, the team did meet for Zoom sessions. According to the senior leader, the underclassmen are meshing well with the team. The youngsters feature big personalities. Outside of team bonding, the Cavaliers\u2019 coaching staff set the players up for successful at-home sessions during the past few months. Handling the scheduling effects of COVID-19 is challenging, but the coaching staff aims to keep the players ready for the fall. \u201cI\u2019ve been hyping up our coaches a lot, but I mean, they\u2019re awesome,\u201d Billiard said. \u201cThey literally sent us a Google doc of all of the things we can by ourselves, just like working on our approach or doing a self-toss to attack or just peppering with our siblings and little things like that.\u201d Billiard took advantage of peppering with siblings, while others did their best to creatively stay in shape as well. With the squad back in Charlottesville, there\u2019s excitement in the air. Players are back together with fellow teammates. Coaches can interact with athletes in person rather than through video conference calls. Unfortunately, there\u2019s still uncertainty surrounding the fall season. The ACC delayed the start of fall athletic competitions until at least Sept. 1, and there are concerns the fall sports season won\u2019t occur at all. That leaves programs like UVa volleyball balancing uncertainty with the potential excitement of competing again. \u201cWe\u2019re just dealing with what we know is in front of us,\u201d Virginia head coach Aaron Smith said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know exactly what the future holds, but we know what we can control, and that\u2019s training and being ready for August, whenever we\u2019re officially back in the gym as a team for required activity.\u201d Much like the UVa football team, the volleyball team is preparing with a fall season in mind. \u201cThe goal is to be ready,\u201d Smith said. Even if the season doesn\u2019t go on as planned, the Cavaliers will spend the time leading up to any announcements safely preparing as a team. It\u2019s been a long few months, and while extra health protocols are in place for practices and competition, the Wahoos are happy to be back together. \u201cA lot of them have said, \u2018Man, I didn\u2019t realize how much I would miss this,\u2019\u201d Smith said. \u201cMaybe they took it for granted because you know you\u2019re gonna have another chance next Friday or next Sunday to play, but I think that has elevated in a lot of their minds of man, to able to compete, to be able to play the sport that we love is something we\u2019re just eager to get back and be able to do.\u201d","461":"Former Virginia linebacker Jordan Mack became the first Carolina Panthers player to opt out of the 2020 NFL season due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Panthers announced the move Tuesday in addition to a handful of other roster moves. Mack, an undrafted rookie, will not receive the $150,000 salary advance offered to drafted players or athletes who played in 2019 and decide to opt out because of the pandemic. NFL players have until Aug. 3 to decide to opt out of the season. As an undrafted rookie, it would\u2019ve been a challenge for Mack to make Carolina\u2019s roster, especially with the preseason canceled. Typically, undrafted players battle for roster spots throughout preseason camp and preseason games, often showcasing their ability in the exhibition games. That\u2019s not an option this season. Mack, who battled an injury at the end of the 2019 season, performed well when healthy for Virginia. He finished his senior season with 69 tackles and 7.5 sacks across 13 games. He missed the Orange Bowl and the majority of the ACC Championship game with an ankle issue. Fellow rookie Bryce Hall was placed on the New York Jets\u2019 COVID-19 reserve list Tuesday. That means Hall, a former Virginia cornerback, either tested positive for COVID-19 or is quarantining due to close contact with someone who tested positive. NFL teams aren\u2019t allowed to disclose whether players are positive or quarantining. The organizations can only say the players are on the COVID-19 reserve list. Elsewhere across the NFL, former Virginia wide receiver and current rookie Joe Reed recently signed his rookie deal with the Los Angeles Chargers. The team announced the news Saturday. It\u2019s unclear how the canceled preseason and altered offseason will impact Bryce Perkins\u2019 chances of making the Rams\u2019 roster. Outside of Jared Goff, questions remain for Los Angeles at quarterback. Perkins could find himself in a battle for the backup spot when activity ramps up within NFL organizations. Much like other professional leagues, the action is being altered by COVID-19. Those changes are impacting the UVa NFL rookies.","462":"The ACC announced plans for its 2020 fall athletic season Wednesday, and those plans all but tore up Virginia\u2019s original 2020 football schedule. Due to an ACC-wide change, UVa won\u2019t open the season against the Bulldogs in Atlanta. Athletic competition for all seven ACC sponsored fall sports is slated to begin the week of Sept. 7. The ACC football schedule includes 10 conference games and just one nonconference matchup. For the one nonconference game, Virginia can select the school, but the ACC announcement dictates the game be played in the state of Virginia. That means UVa\u2019s neutral site game with Georgia is off the table, although the teams could theoretically agree to play in the commonwealth. Nonconference games against VMI, UConn and Old Dominion also are potential options for Virginia\u2019s one nonconference matchup in 2020. With a conference-only plus one schedule, the ACC is doing away with divisions for the 2020 football season. The top two teams based on highest conference winning percentage will compete in Charlotte on Dec. 12 or Dec. 19 for the ACC title. Notre Dame will join the league for 2020, and the Fighting Irish are eligible to compete for the ACC championship. With Notre Dame\u2019s addition for the season comes the sharing of TV revenue, including that of the Fighting Irish\u2019s home NBC broadcasts, among all 15 member schools. When it comes to conference scheduling for the Wahoos, the dates of football games are yet to be announced, but UVa home games will include matchups with Boston College, Duke, Louisville, North Carolina and North Carolina State. The Cavaliers\u2019 five road games come against Clemson, Florida State, Miami, Virginia Tech and Wake Forest. \u201cToday\u2019s decision was made after months of thoughtful planning by numerous individuals throughout the conference,\u201d ACC Commissioner John Swofford said. \u201cThe Board\u2019s decision presents a path, if public health guidance allows, to move forward with competition. Our institutions are committed to taking the necessary measures to facilitate the return in a safe and responsible manner.\u201d Swofford knows there\u2019s the chance public health guidance won\u2019t allow the new schedule to work. \u201cWe recognize that we may need to be nimble and make adjustments in the future,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will be as prepared as possible should that need arise.\u201d For football, the 11 games will be played over at least a 13-week span. The goal is to provide multiple open dates for programs, which provide flexibility, should games need to be postponed or schedules adjusted due to positive COVID-19 tests. Fall Olympic sports can begin competition on Sept. 10. Team sports will compete in conference schedules meeting the NCAA\u2019s minimum requirement for games. Soccer and field hockey teams will play six conference games, while volleyball will play 10 matches. Cross country meets can be scheduled at each member institution\u2019s discretion. Interestingly, games can be played against conference opponents outside the minimum schedule, but those extra contests for fall Olympic sports won\u2019t count as conference games. For example, if the UVa women\u2019s soccer team receives a six-game league schedule that doesn\u2019t include Wake Forest, the Cavaliers can still schedule the Demon Deacons, but it will count as a nonconference match. The ACC also announced the schedule for fall championships. Oct. 30 will be the date for the league\u2019s cross country championships in Cary, North Carolina. Field hockey will compete at Duke from Nov. 5-8. Both men\u2019s and women\u2019s soccer will play the ACC Championships at Wake Forest. The women compete on Nov. 6 and 8, while the men play on Nov. 13 and 15. Fall competition for golf, tennis, rowing, lacrosse, softball and baseball has been canceled. The ACC\u2019s plan also details testing protocol, which is similar to what the NCAA announced last week. Football players must take tests within three days of competition and receive negative COVID-19 test results to compete in the athletic event. The league shared a risk assessment of each sport, ranking them in high, medium and low categories. Football, volleyball, field hockey, soccer, lacrosse, basketball, wrestling and rowing all fell into the high risk category. Baseball, softball and cross country were dubbed medium risk. Golf, tennis, fencing, track & field and swimming and diving were deemed low risk. It\u2019s a detailed return-to-sports plan from the ACC, which leaned on its Medical Advisory Group to come up with the decisions. Even with the changes, uncertainty remains. According to the league, several different factors can derail competitions. From an inability to isolate new positive cases to unsafe campus-wide or local community transmission rates, barriers remain to a safe fall season. \u201cAs we look ahead to the fall, the safety of our students, staff and overall campus community continues to be our top priority,\u201d Kent Syverud, Syracuse University Chancellor and Chair of the ACC Board of Directors, said in a statement. \u201cToday\u2019s announcement outlines a specific path for ACC fall sports to return to intercollegiate athletic competition using comprehensive protocols put forward by our ACC Medical Advisory Group. As a league, we understand the need to stay flexible and be prepared to adjust as medical information evolves in conjunction with local and state health guidelines.\u201d The ACC has a plan in place to play fall sports, but with more than a month until the scheduled start of athletic competition and students yet to arrive on campuses by the thousands; it\u2019s unclear whether the plan will ever be allowed to come to fruition.","463":"Six months after the initial schedule release, the ACC announced a new 2020 football schedule on Wednesday to account for a global pandemic. The new schedule includes 10 conference games and one nonconference matchup that must occur in the team\u2019s home state. For UVa, that means playing Georgia in Atlanta isn\u2019t an option. News from the ACC meant a drastic change in UVa\u2019s expected 2020 schedule. The original schedule was as follows: Sept. 7: Georgia in Atlanta Sept. 12: VMI Sept. 19: UConn Sept. 26: at Clemson Oct. 3: North Carolina Oct. 10: Bye week Oct. 17: at Georgia Tech Oct. 24: at Old Dominion Oct. 31: Miami Nov. 7: Louisville Nov. 13: at Duke Nov. 21: Pittsburgh Nov. 28: at Virginia Tech Instead, the Cavaliers\u2019 2020 schedule will include home games with Boston College, Duke, Louisville, North Carolina and N.C. State. Road games will come against Clemson, Florida State, Miami, Virginia Tech and Wake Forest. Game dates are to be determined, but the first week of the season will be from Sept. 7-12. Each team will receive two open dates to allow for any potential schedule changes. The open dates, if the season can occur safely at all, could prove critical. Michigan State and Rutgers are among the programs quarantining for two weeks after positive COVID-19 case totals within the program halted workouts. If quarantine is required during the season, teams could potentially use open dates to reschedule postponed contests. According to Dr. John MacKnight, UVa\u2019s representative on the ACC\u2019s COVID-19 Medical Advisory Group, there\u2019s no set number of positive cases that would shut down workouts prior to the season or games during the season. While Virginia and other programs don\u2019t necessarily have an exact threshold in mind, the possibility of stopping the season or practices still exists. \u201cI think we all sort of come to the same conclusion which is, \u2018Yeah, I think I\u2019ll have that gut sense when I reach a certain number that we\u2019re no longer able to continue at least with this group and we have to pull the plug with them for a little bit,\u2019 but we\u2019ve sort of shied away from having that definitively placed in a protocol because none of us could completely define it,\u201d MacKnight said. The ACC\u2019s Wednesday announcement did include a report of recommendations from the Medical Advisory Group. The recommendations included reasons games could be canceled, which ranged from local hospitals running out of resources to local health officials deeming communities unsafe due to rising COVID-19 case numbers. A new ACC football schedule was announced Wednesday, but it doesn\u2019t remove the uncertainty surrounding the feasibility of the 2020 fall season. Virginia head coach Bronco Mendenhall has gone on the record saying he\u2019d like at least eight games to be played for the 2020 schedule to count and feel like a full season. \u201cAnything less than eight I don\u2019t think would be appropriate to ask of them,\u201d Mendenhall said. The schedule currently sits at 11 games, assuming COVID-19 doesn\u2019t lead to additional changes in the schedule or the eventual cancellation of the fall season. When it comes to opponents, UVa\u2019s original 2020 schedule featured four nonconference games. If the 2020 season occurs safely, Virginia will play just one nonconference game, and it will have to be played within the commonwealth against a program with testing and health standards deemed acceptable by the ACC. All of the nonconference teams originally scheduled are theoretically still options for that lone game, although the game against Georgia can\u2019t occur in Atlanta. It\u2019s also more likely Georgia and Georgia Tech would meet for the one nonconference game rather than UVa and Georgia. The other three games were originally scheduled to take place in Virginia and one of those opponents \u2013 VMI, UConn and Old Dominion \u2013 could end up as the lone remaining nonconference team the Cavaliers face this fall. Boston College, N.C. State, Florida State and Wake Forest are the four opponents on the updated 2020 schedule that didn\u2019t appear on the original schedule. Of the previously scheduled foes, Duke turned into a home contest, and the game against Miami turned into a road trip. Virginia\u2019s road slate looks daunting, but it\u2019s worth mentioning that there\u2019s no official word on crowd capacity from ACC programs. If the season occurs, however, it is likely that crowds will be extremely small compared to typical seasons. Typically, Clemson brings in just over 80,000 fans per home game. Starting Monday, South Carolina is reopening certain venues, but limiting mass gatherings to 250 people. There are possible exceptions to state guidance when it comes to crowd capacity at sporting events, but it\u2019s likely that teams bring in significantly reduced crowds this fall. That hampers any potential home-field advantage seen in a typical season. Smaller crowds means UVa could benefit from playing in relative calm road environments against teams like Clemson, Florida State and Miami. The on-field questions surrounding Virginia\u2019s matchups are fascinating, especially if home-field advantages are mitigated. UVa football continues preparing for a season as August arrives this weekend. The start date of a potential season is just over a month away, and it\u2019s still unclear if the Cavaliers will actually suit up and play games this fall, but the ACC made plans with the hope that COVID-19 doesn\u2019t take away another college sports season.","464":"The WNBA recently started its 2020 season, and the NBA and NHL ramp up competition this weekend after months of missed time. MLB games have returned, although the league is fighting through positive COVID-19 tests that threaten to halt or drastically change the schedule. On the golf course, the LPGA Tour returns to action Friday, joining the PGA Tour, which has been playing tournaments since mid-June. The return of the LPGA Tour brings three former University of Virginia golfers back to the course. Brittany Altomare, Lauren Coughlin and Elizabeth Szokol are all in the field for the LPGA Drive On Championship, a three-round event that begins Friday morning. \u201cI love tournament golf,\u201d Altomare said in an email, \u201cso I\u2019m really excited for all those feelings to come back when we tee it up Friday.\u201d The 29-year-old finished in a tie for 13th in her last tournament event, which took place in Australia in February. Altomare took time off after the event, using quarantine to take her mind away from golf. She used about six weeks to prepare for the return to competitive golf. Competitive golf looks different this summer, though. There won\u2019t be fans at Iverness Club in Toledo, Ohio, and that\u2019s hardly the only change. Players receive temperature screenings at the course, and there are testing and quarantine protocols for the duration of the season. Handshakes, hugs and high fives are not allowed, and social distancing is encouraged. Gaby Lopez tested positive prior to this weekend\u2019s event and withdrew. It\u2019s a change from the typical tournament. At the same time, it\u2019s still golf. \u201cThere\u2019s definitely more protocols to follow each day to make sure everyone is staying healthy and safe, but as for the golf I believe it will be about the same,\u201d Altomare said. \u201cHopefully sometime in the future we will be allowed to have fans because playing in front of fans is what makes competing so much fun. But until then, it\u2019s just going to be nice to compete again.\u201d Altomare\u2019s return begins with a 12:33 p.m. Friday tee time. Coughlin opens the return-to-play with a 7 a.m. tee time, while Szokol quickly follows at 7:16 a.m. For the players, their focus lies outside the coronavirus. They want to trust the LPGA\u2019s protocols and their focus sits on their games as they return from months off from competitive play. Leagues like the NWSL and PGA Tour have shown that a return to play is possible. Playing golf during a pandemic can happen safely given the distant nature of the outdoor sport. It doesn\u2019t mean the process will be perfect \u2014 former UVa golfer Denny McCarthy was among the PGA Tour players to test positive for COVID-19 \u2014 but the events should be able to take place. That\u2019s great news for a group of golfers who missed the competitive game. \u201cIt was definitely nice to see the PGA able to come back first and be able to do it so successfully,\u201d Altomare said. \u201cI think the LPGA was able to learn a lot from them so I feel confident in the LPGA\u2019s ability to keep everyone safe while playing.\u201d","465":"In its latest round of COVID-19 testing, the Cavaliers received no additional positive tests. Since testing began on July 5, 235 student-athletes have been tested. Of those 235 student-athletes, only four have produced positive tests. The football team has had 112 student-athletes tested, with three athletes producing positive results. That means 123 student-athletes from other sports have combined to produce just one positive result. None of the student-athletes who tested positive were hospitalized. Football, men\u2019s and women\u2019s soccer, men\u2019s and women\u2019s basketball, volleyball and field hockey are the UVa athletic programs back in Charlottesville preparing for the upcoming fall season. The ACC announced earlier this week that athletic competition can begin in early September, as long as programs follow ACC health guidelines. Football games can begin the week of Sept. 7, while Olympic sport competitions can start Sept. 10. Wearing masks, sanitizing equipment and physically distancing are among the different protocols in place to keep Virginia athletes safe ahead of the season. So far, the plans are working. Dates for schedules are still to be determined, although UVa received its 10 football conference foes for the 2020 fall season this week. Other programs, including Olympic sports, await their official fall schedules. In the meantime, the Cavaliers will continue their preseason workouts thanks to superb testing numbers through the first three weeks back on Grounds. Adding in students and in-person classes will add a wrinkle to the plans for a safe return to sports. Travel to road contests also adds a challenge yet faced by the Virginia athletic programs. Challenges remain, but the Cavaliers have done well through the initial stages of returning to competitive action.","466":"Football draws the most attention of the fall college sports, but it\u2019s far from the only relevant collegiate athletic competition hoping to return to action during a pandemic. As college administrators ponder how to safely play fall college football, they\u2019re also coming up with plans to play Olympic sports safely, starting in September. In addition to football, Virginia\u2019s volleyball, field hockey, soccer and basketball programs are back in Charlottesville preparing for a return to athletic competition. \u201cJust going through some initial protocols to get back on the court here as soon as we can for voluntary workouts,\u201d UVa volleyball head coach Aaron Smith said last week. \u201cThey\u2019ve reported, and yeah, eager to get back in the gym here soon.\u201d On Wednesday, the ACC released return-to-play guidelines and scheduling changes. While football scheduling attracted the most headlines, every fall sport was impacted by the ACC\u2019s announcement. As players excitedly return to campuses for workouts, they\u2019re now greeted with new protocols and an unusual schedule. Health standards COVID-19 remains a massive hurdle to a safe fall season. Testing and other health standards are critical to the success of any fall sports taking place safely. For volleyball, field hockey, soccer, lacrosse, basketball, wresting and rowing \u2014 all deemed high-risk sports in terms of potential COVID-19 exposure by the ACC \u2014 will receive COVID-19 tests every week, starting with the first week of competition. The ACC will allow fall Olympic sports to compete beginning on Sept. 10, per the latest announcement from the league. That means at a minimum, athletes need to be tested in early September. For medium-risk sports \u2014 baseball, softball and cross country \u2014 tests are required every other week. Low-risk sports \u2014 golf, tennis, track and field, fencing and swimming and diving \u2014 don\u2019t require tests. Those programs are asked to follow local and state guidelines when it comes to receiving tests and maintaining physical distance from other competitors. Other minimum health standards include contact tracing, arguably one of the biggest hurdles to a fall season happening safely. If someone is deemed to have close contact with someone who tests positive for the coronavirus, they\u2019re required to quarantine for 14 days before a return to activity. Players who test positive are isolated for at least 10 days as they aim to recover from the virus. Specific medical treatments are determined by the team\u2019s medical staff. \u201cThe quarantine time is really a trickle down from the CDC, and so I think as each of us, individual teams, individual conferences and up to the NCAA, I think really what we\u2019re finding is when standards like that are established by an organization with their broad-reaching impact on all of our lives, it\u2019s really difficult to offer up anything that is less stringent and feel comfortable with it,\u201d Dr. John MacKnight, UVa\u2019s representative on the ACC\u2019s COVID-19 Medical Advisory Group, said. The quarantine from contact tracing particularly hurts Olympic sports. While the football team has more than 100 players, the UVa women\u2019s soccer team\u2019s roster included 26 players a season ago. The volleyball team\u2019s roster lists 17 student-athletes. One positive test followed by contact tracing could leave the team without a significant percentage of its roster for two weeks. That could lead to cancellations or postponements, whereas a handful of football players testing positive might not stop a game from occurring as scheduled. Some immunity buildup is possible within programs, but there\u2019s still limited research on how long immunity lasts. Under the current guidelines, players who test positive and recover don\u2019t have to take weekly pre-competition testing for 90 days, starting from the date of the positive test. If an athlete who tested positive once starts to show symptoms, then they are tested again. The 90-day rule is based off research that suggests people who test positive and recover develop immunity for at least a 90-day period. New research could lead to future changes in that protocol. Other health protocols, like sanitization of facilities, are also outlined by the ACC and apply to all athletic programs. It\u2019s a tricky situation, and considerations like contact tracing and quarantining make a return-to-action all the more challenging, especially for Olympic sports. Return to action Fall Olympic sports can begin competition on Sept. 10, and ACC programs will play conference schedules meeting the NCAA minimum number of games. For field hockey and soccer, that\u2019s six games. Volleyball will play 10 ACC matches. The limited number of events helps with the return of Olympic sports. For example, soccer teams could play a minimum schedule of six matches, reducing travel and leaving a few months to schedule just a handful of matches. A light schedule can incorporate flexibility when it comes to cancellations or postponements. Cross country events vary by what each school can schedule safely. There\u2019s no minimum number of races. The conference championship for cross country includes all 15 ACC programs and will be held in North Carolina on Oct. 30. Field hockey and both ACC soccer championships will be held in early to mid-November. Golf, tennis, rowing, lacrosse, softball and baseball competitions are canceled for the fall. These programs can practice in the fall, assuming their university deems it acceptable. The bottom line When students return to Grounds, it\u2019s close to impossible for UVa student-athletes to remain in \u201cbubbles\u201d like the WNBA, NBA and NWSL have done with reasonable success. With football, volleyball, field hockey and soccer all deemed high-risk sports by the ACC, putting together a safe fall sports season is an incredible challenge. The ACC announced its minimum standards for testing, but even those don\u2019t guarantee a safe fall season. Fall sports begin competition in about a month, and it remains to be seen if any of UVa\u2019s athletic programs will actually be able to safely put together a 2020 season.","467":"VMI hopes to play a football game at Virginia. But the Keydets must first play a waiting game. The ACC announced Wednesday a new scheduling model, prompted by the coronavirus pandemic, that calls for each of its football teams to play 10 conference games plus just one nonleague game. So VMI, which is scheduled to visit UVa on Sept. 12, is waiting to find out if the Cavaliers still want to play that game. \u201cI\u2019m very optimistic and hopeful that the UVa game will be played,\u201d VMI coach Scott Wachenheim said in a phone interview. UVa\u2019s original schedule had four nonleague games, including a Sept. 5 neutral-site game in Atlanta with Southeastern Conference member Georgia, whose league scrapped nonconference games Thursday. The Cavaliers\u2019 other nonconference matchups are the VMI game; a Sept. 19 home game with Connecticut; and an Oct. 24 game at Old Dominion. The ACC is requiring that each football team\u2019s lone nonleague game be held in the ACC school\u2019s home state. \u201cFor UVa, we can bus up the day of the game,\u201d Wachenheim said. VMI\u2019s chances of staying on the UVa schedule could be boosted by the Keydets being in a military school \u201cbubble.\u201d \u201cThe discipline that our school has and the way that we can contain not only our athletes but the entire student population I think would make us an opponent that people would highly consider playing because I think we can do a better job not only controlling our athletes\u2019 exposure but our entire student population\u2019s exposure to the coronavirus,\u201d Wachenheim said. FCS member VMI, which last played the Cavaliers in 2013, is due to reap $375,000 from UVa for the game. \u201cAs a Division I FCS team, the finances provided from games like that help us run our program,\u201d Wachenheim said. \u201cSo there\u2019s a lot of interest on the VMI football end and on my end for us to go up there.\u201d Under the contract, UVa would have to pay VMI only $50,000 if it cancels the game. There is a clause that removes that financial penalty if the game is canceled because of an epidemic or an \u201cact of God,\u201d although it remains to be seen whether that clause would fit this scenario because UVa would still be choosing to play 11 other games. The NCAA issued guidelines two weeks ago about COVID-19 tests for athletes. The NCAA recommends testing and results should be obtained by schools within 72 hours of a football game kicking off. When asked about those NCAA recommendations, VMI athletic director Dave Diles said in an email last week that VMI had not yet devised its testing plans. The ACC announced Wednesday that not only must ACC football players be tested within three days of a football game kicking off, but also that any nonleague foe must agree to follow those same ACC testing requirements for that week. Could VMI afford to test its entire team the week of the UVa game? \u201cThe ACC has its testing protocols and we are looking forward to playing Virginia and meeting those protocols,\u201d Diles said in an email Thursday. VMI did test its freshman football and basketball players when they reported to campus this month for summer workouts. The ACC\u2019s new plan calls for no football games to be played before the week beginning on Monday, Sept. 7. So if the VMI game remains Sept. 12, it would become UVa\u2019s opener. VMI, which is a Southern Conference member, already has one hole to fill on its schedule. The Keydets were supposed to host Ivy League member Princeton on Sept. 19, but the Ivy League announced on July 8 that it was suspending the fall sports season. If UVa cancels the VMI game, that would leave the Keydets with two holes on its 11-game schedule. But Wachenheim is confident that Diles, who handles the football schedule, could fill both holes. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of teams looking for games, so I\u2019m not concerned,\u201d Wachenheim said. The Colonial Athletic Association has scrapped the fall football season in favor of the spring, but CAA members James Madison and Elon still plan to play football this fall and thus are crafting schedules to play as independents. Wachenheim said he does not know if Diles is talking with JMU or Elon, but VMI could be a suitable foe for either school. \u201cJMU, that\u2019s less than an hour bus ride. We could go up there or they could come down here,\u201d Wachenheim said. \u201cWe could easily get to Elon \u2026 on a day-of-game travel.\u201d VMI\u2019s other nonleague game is a Sept. 5 visit to Robert Morris. There are currently no snags with that game. Robert Morris is playing as a football independent this year as it makes a transition from the Northeast Conference to being a football-only Big South member. The FCS football playoffs are still scheduled for 2020. But the NCAA Board of Governors could decide next week to cancel them or move them to the spring. If the football playoffs are moved to the spring, leagues such as the SoCon will have to decide if they want to move their season to the spring as well. \u201cI don\u2019t know whether there\u2019s playoffs or not playoffs would determine whether you decide to play in the fall,\u201d Wachenheim said. \u201cThe spring is an idea that\u2019s being floated out there. I do believe there is some merit to that. But there\u2019s a lot more that meets the eye with moving football to the spring that would have to be fully, fully considered. \u201cAs long as we can play safely, the Southern Conference coaches are united in wanting to play in the fall.\u201d","468":"Sunday marks 100 days until the scheduled return of Tony Bennett\u2019s squad. Even three months away from the start of the season, uncertainty lingers. Will the fall sports season be played safely amid the COVID-19 pandemic? How does playing indoors impact the potential of a safe college basketball season? \u201cIn college basketball, we are still planning on starting the season right now on schedule on Nov. 10,\u201d NCAA Senior Vice President Dan Gavitt said in a recent interview with the NCAA\u2019s digital team. \u201cWe have plans across the country through our schools and conferences to bring students back to campus safely just this month in August and early September. Many players have been on campus for weeks now, training on campus in a very safe way and have been very happy to be back playing the game they love with their coaches.\u201d The UVa men\u2019s basketball team returned to Grounds in mid-July. The Cavaliers\u2019 social media accounts shared photos of the team working out in a socially distanced manner. Bennett wore gloves and a face covering in one of the photos, while players wore masks. Since their arrival in Charlottesville, 123 student-athletes outside the football program have been tested for COVID-19. Just one of those athletes has produced a positive test. At the professional ranks, the WNBA and NBA recently began their seasons successfully. While some players opted out of playing in the respective bubbles, once teams arrived in Florida, positive cases have been low. The bubble system seems to be off to a strong start. \u201cYou\u2019re seeing how difficult it is for the MLB, NFL, all these different leagues to try and get this [going], and I\u2019d say we\u2019re fortunate where we\u2019re in a position where the NBA has done an extremely good job of allowing us to be here, providing us this sort of environment where we all feel safe and comfortable and really not have a lot of cases or a lot of distractions for that matter,\u201d former UVa standout Joe Harris said recently. Harris and the Brooklyn Nets played their first game in the NBA\u2019s bubble Friday. He finished with 14 points in a loss. The NCAA hopes to build off the success of professional leagues playing basketball without putting athletes, coaches and event personnel at risk. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a high level of confidence, as I\u2019ve said before, that as long as basketball\u2019s being played safely anywhere in the world this season, that we\u2019ll be playing NCAA college basketball as well, both regular season and certainly the tournament in 2021,\u201d Gavitt said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got all sorts of plans and alternatives that we\u2019re looking at in order to be able to do that in a safe and responsible way, but a high level of confidence there\u2019s going to be \u2014 while different \u2014 a great experience playing college basketball again for those guys that want to come back to school, finish their education and have the great college basketball experience.\u201d Gavitt\u2019s comparison is a bit perplexing. Comparing the NBA\u2019s restart to safely playing college games isn\u2019t quite like apples to apples. For one, college athletes won\u2019t be in a bubble. Keeping case numbers low while practicing in a socially distanced manner is much easier than keeping case numbers low when playing games and taking classes with thousands of students on campus. Taking some online classes can help reduce the level of exposure for student-athletes, but reducing exposure at the same level the NBA limits exposure is close to impossible. Traveling to games across the country also brings increased risk of exposure, whereas the WNBA and NBA games are all being played at one location. Recent postponements due to positive COVID-19 tests across Major League Baseball highlight the challenges of competing outside a bubble. Whether it is players, coaches, or event personnel testing positive for COVID-19, people face exposure when outside of a bubble system. Any positive tests from those groups can hinder the chance of a safe season. Add in the fact that the ACC recently dubbed basketball as a high-risk sport, and it\u2019s clear playing a full college basketball season safely starting in November is a major challenge. The NCAA expects conferences and administrators to take their time with any decisions to change the season, though. It\u2019s worth waiting to see the attempted return of fall sports while also learning from professional leagues about what it takes to start and finish a season safely. \u201cI think at this point, we\u2019re probably looking at some time in September having to make decisions about whether we stick with a plan to start on Nov. 10 or consider other alternatives,\u201d Gavitt said. While decisions may not come until September, plenty of events this month can impact the chances of Virginia\u2019s season opener taking place on time. In-person classes for UVa undergraduate students begin on Aug. 25. Other leagues \u2014 like MLB \u2014 are still navigating how to balance positive COVID-19 tests with a regular schedule of games. The NCAA board of governors is set to meet Tuesday. The meeting could include a potential decision on NCAA fall championships or at least more guidance for competing safely this fall. Plans are in place to return students to campuses and to begin athletic competition in the next six weeks. The college basketball season is slated to begin Nov. 10. While those plans haven\u2019t changed, the likelihood of those events happening without a hitch is unclear. Playing outside a bubble complicates the return-to-play efforts. The focus lies on starting fall sports, but for the UVa men\u2019s basketball program, the next month could determine how its season looks.","469":"Virginia women\u2019s golf coach Ria Scott believes the program\u2019s redesigned Birdwood Golf Course will elevate both the Cavaliers\u2019 men\u2019s and women\u2019s golf teams. \u201cIt\u2019s the best in our conference from what I know and one of the best in the country,\u201d Scott told The Daily Progress in late June, \u201cso it\u2019s a real game changer for the teams.\u201d The game-changing course is now officially open. It\u2019s been about a month since the course\u2019s reopening, and the reception from members and guests has been positive thus far. \u201cThe reopening has gone extremely well,\u201d Martin Winters, Birdwood\u2019s PGA director of golf, said. \u201cI think generally it\u2019s been overwhelming positive feedback about the course, the staff, all the new facilities. People are happy, and I think part of it too is just being without a course for almost two years, but then also the excitement of watching the renovation.\u201d After the long renovation process, the course is complete and open to the public. Even with COVID-19, the course and clubhouse are used similarly to other years. Pins remain in holes, however, as a small Styrofoam-like circle sits at the bottom of each hole. This ensures the ball doesn\u2019t drop all the way into the hole, making it easier to remove without touching the bottom of the cup, along with every other golfer. Clubhouse staff and cart attendants are among the staff members who wear masks. It\u2019s slightly different, but the on-course experience feels familiar. When it comes to the course, there are noticeable changes, which Winters believes are all for the better. Holes have been redesigned, utilizing the land to showcase scenic views. Amenities, such as carts with GPS systems to help with yardages and a large putting course for practice, are also new additions. \u201cI think truly they love the aesthetics, the beautiful views that you get almost everywhere on the golf course,\u201d Winters said of those who have played the course. \u201cThey were there on the old course, but you just couldn\u2019t see them. We changed elevations and did some clearing, got rid of some invasive species to open up those views.\u201d The course also features six sets of tees, allowing it to host top-tier players from the tips at a distance of 7,116 yards. The shortest tees check in at 3,856 yards, allowing beginners to play the course without needing to hit the ball far. While those who have visited have shared positive thoughts with Winters, the UVa golf programs have yet to arrive in Charlottesville. The ACC recently canceled fall athletic competition for golf programs. While the teams can practice in Charlottesville \u2013 and golf is deemed a low-risk sport by the ACC \u2013 there won\u2019t be any tournaments for the men\u2019s or women\u2019s golf programs this fall. When the Cavaliers do tee it up again competitively, it\u2019ll be close to a year since they last played competitive team events. Fortunately for the players, their upcoming arrival in Charlottesville brings the opportunity to compete amongst each other at a championship-level course. They\u2019ll be tested by multiple holes with hazards, while also taking on a few short Par 4s offering scoring chances. The facility UVa\u2019s golf programs hope to use to develop into national title contenders is now open and available for use. \u201cOur guys are going to have a lot to work with,\u201d men\u2019s golf head coach Bowen Sargent told The Daily Progress in late June.","470":"Shane Simpson, a versatile running back from Towson, announced that he\u2019s heading to UVa as a graduate transfer. Simpson is eligible to play this fall, which will be his final collegiate season. The NFL prospect opted to enter the transfer portal after the Colonial Athletic Association canceled its fall football season due to COVID-19. In the past few days, he\u2019s been fielding offers from FBS schools, hoping to make a quick decision ahead of a potential fall season. Simpson, who was an FCS All-American in 2018, played just three games in 2019 before suffering a season-ending knee injury. A fall season could give him the chance to prove his regained health to NFL scouts, while also showcasing his ability at the Power 5 level. When healthy, Simpson dominated the FCS level. The 5-foot-9 running back features game-changing speed and elusiveness. He\u2019s a shifty runner with great hands. Part of what makes Simpson such an elite talent is his special teams ability. Simpson excels in the return game, which could prove valuable for a Virginia team that lost Joe Reed at kickoff returner. In 2018, Simpson was named the CAA Special Teams Player of the Year. Interestingly, Simpson made All-CAA teams from three positions in 2018. The athletic runner earned spots on the all-conference squads as a running back, kick returner and punt returner. He immediately adds explosive ability to UVa\u2019s backfield and return game. He tallied 711 rushing yards in 2018 on 151 carries, including six touchdown runs. He snagged 39 receptions for 356 yards and five touchdowns. As a returner he amassed 887 kickoff return yards and 104 punt return yards. He took one of the kickoffs back for a touchdown. Currently, UVa has Wayne Taulapapa and Mike Hollins as its likely contributors at running back in 2020. Ronnie Walker Jr., an Indiana transfer, is hoping to receive a waiver ahead of the fall season. Heading into the 2020 season, running back sits as a potential strength for the Cavaliers. With a solid offensive line and two dual-threat quarterbacks vying for the starting job, it wouldn\u2019t be surprising to see offensive coordinator Robert Anae lean on the running game when the Cavaliers take the field. The recruiting victories during the pandemic keep coming in for the Wahoos. If there\u2019s a fall season, they\u2019ll be joined by one of the most dynamic FCS playmakers in recent seasons.","471":"Bryce Perkins excelled against the Hokies, and he kept the Orange Bowl loss to Florida competitive. Defensively, the Cavaliers struggled late in the season, in part due to an influx of mid- and late-season injuries. Entering 2020, the questions about Virginia\u2019s on-field product come on the offensive side of the football, though, as several of the stars from the end of 2019 moved to the NFL. Can UVa produce as effectively at quarterback without Perkins? Will the running backs carry a heavier load than they did in 2019? Does the loss of Hasise Dubois and Joe Reed stifle the Cavaliers\u2019 passing attack? Fortunately for Bronco Mendenhall and the Wahoos, a handful of transfer additions may provide answers to those questions. Virginia\u2019s head coach brought in five talented transfers on the offensive side of the football, and there\u2019s a chance all five see playing time the next time the Cavaliers take the field for a game. Keytaon Thompson, QB With Brennan Armstrong returning, the Cavaliers weren\u2019t completely helpless at the position, but Thompson adds depth and talent at quarterback. The graduate transfer will have two years of eligibility remaining. At Mississippi State, Thompson finished his career with 18 total touchdowns, including 10 rushing touchdowns on 99 carries. He averaged 6.8 yards per rush with the Bulldogs. \u201cTo win the Coastal Division and the ACC championship, two quarterbacks are always necessary, not just one,\u201d Mendenhall said on Twitter after Thompson announced his commitment. \u201cSo in addition to Brennan Armstrong, that we already love, we get a chance to now welcome Keytaon Thompson to our program. That just increases our chances to have the season we\u2019re all hoping for.\u201d Of course, now there is no Coastal Division for the 2020 fall season due to scheduling changes brought about by COVID-19. Regardless, Mendenhall wants multiple quarterbacks with starting potential on his roster. With Armstrong and Thompson, he feels confident entering the year. Checking in at 6-foot-4 and 225 pounds, Thompson gives Virginia an interesting option at quarterback outside of Armstrong. Thompson is mobile and strong, and he could prove valuable in the running game, even if Armstrong earns the starting nod in 2020. Ronnie Walker Jr., RB Walker Jr. comes to Virginia after two years at Indiana. He\u2019s hopeful he\u2019ll receive a waiver for immediate eligibility. When he takes the field, he\u2019ll have two seasons of eligibility left with the Cavaliers. He carried the ball 59 times for 221 yards and a pair of touchdowns while at Indiana. He also added 12 catches for 112 yards and a touchdown for the Hoosiers. If the Virginia native does receive a waiver for the fall, he\u2019ll be thrust into the running back competition with Wayne Taulapapa and Mike Hollins. Expect all of those players to earn playing time if they\u2019re healthy, given the importance of depth at the running back position at the Power 5 level. Virginia has the pieces to use multiple running backs throughout each game. Shane Simpson, RB Add another one into the mix at running back. Simpson announced his commitment to Virginia on Sunday. The graduate transfer with NFL dreams hopes to play his final season of college football this fall. The CAA canceled its fall season due to COVID-19, leaving Simpson looking to play elsewhere. He\u2019s an ultra-athletic runner who dominated the FCS level at Towson. In 2018, he earned all-conference honors at running back, kickoff returner and punt returner. A knee injury cut his 2019 season short, but he\u2019s back to 100% health and ready to compete. Simpson averaged 8.3 yards per offensive touch in 2019 before his injury, and he scored a touchdown running and receiving before the knee injury. When healthy \u2014 like he was when he combined for 1,067 rushing and receiving yards and 11 touchdowns in 2018 \u2014 Simpson presents a unique challenge for defenses. Given his abilities as a receiver, runner and returner, it\u2019s likely he\u2019ll have chances to earn significant playing time, assuming the fall season starts on time and occurs safely. He\u2019s a dynamic addition to the offense and return game. Ra\u2019Shaun Henry, WR A lack of depth at receiver following the departures of Dubois and Reed made Henry a logical offseason addition. The FCS product and graduate transfer comes to Virginia with one year of eligibility remaining. He hauled in 90 receptions for 1,118 yards a season ago for St. Francis, earning All-NEC honors. He reached the end zone nine times as a receiver. \u201cHe brings experience, a dynamic playmaker and a really good person,\u201d Mendenhall said of Henry in May. \u201cReally strong high school program in Texas where he comes from, and he\u2019s anxious to prove himself at the next level, and we have a great need and a program that will really help him reach his potential.\u201d In high school, Henry also excelled as a returner. Adding Henry and Simpson gives the Cavaliers added depth and talent in the return game, which should help make up for the loss of Joe Reed. It\u2019s unclear how Henry will adjust to the Power 5 level coming from a low-level FCS program, but at 6-3 and 195 pounds, Henry possesses the size and speed necessary to compete in the ACC. At the very least, he adds depth at a position in desperate need of additional playmakers and experience. Tony Poljan, TE While UVa\u2019s offense isn\u2019t known for utilizing tight ends, Poljan comes to Charlottesville with the athleticism to change that. The 6-7, 260-pound tight end comes to Charlottesville as a graduate transfer with one year of eligibility remaining. Poljan played quarterback at Central Michigan early in his career before switching over to tight end. He snagged 33 receptions for 496 yards and four touchdowns last season. Hasise Dubois gave the Cavaliers a solid red-zone threat a season ago. Poljan could fill a similar role from a different position this season, attracting the attention of defenses when the Cavaliers come close to the goal line. In the running game, Poljan provides a big body to help block. The bottom line Virginia entered the offseason with questions offensively. While those questions haven\u2019t evaporated, the Cavaliers addressed many of the doubts with the addition of experienced transfers.","472":"Roughly a month remains until the start of the ACC athletic season, and questions remain about the likelihood of a fall sports season. Earlier this week, the University of Virginia delayed the start of undergraduate in-person instruction until Sept. 8, representing a two-week delay. COVID-19 continues to alter college life, including athletics. The NCAA announcement offers little, if any, additional clarity about fall sports. Each division \u2013 from Division I to Division III, is asked to make decisions on their fall athletic seasons by Aug. 21. That leaves just over two weeks for schools, conferences and divisions to make a call on the season. Shortly after the NCAA\u2019s announcement, both the President\u2019s Councils for Division III and Division II canceled fall sports championships. Some FCS conferences have also canceled fall seasons. The news comes as most Power 5 teams are preparing for fall seasons. At UVa, several athletic programs, including football, are back on Grounds preparing for fall competitions. It\u2019s unclear if those seasons can safely take place when students return to Grounds and games start. Practicing wearing masks offers less potential exposure to the virus than full-contact competition between teams from different states. \u201cFirst and foremost, we need to make sure we provide a safe environment for college athletes to compete for an opportunity to play in NCAA championships,\u201d NCAA President Mark Emmert said in a release. \u201cA decision based on the realities in each division will provide clarity for conferences and campuses as they determine how to safely begin the academic year and the return to sports.\u201d The NCAA mandates that all leagues follow its return-to-sport guidelines recently released. If a program can\u2019t follow those protocols this fall, it shouldn\u2019t play. The ability to follow those protocols varies across leagues and divisions. Power 5 athletic programs such as UVa possess more resources than schools at the FCS level or the Division II or Division III levels. That\u2019s part of the reason \u2014 there\u2019s also a financial component \u2014 why Division III schools were more willing to cancel fall sports. Additionally, student-athletes have to be allowed to opt out of the season due to COVID-19 concerns, and those athletes must have their scholarships honored by the university. UVa football head coach Bronco Mendenhall announced in early July that he would honor scholarships if players opted out of the season. Divisions are also required to come up with a plan for eligibility accommodations for those who opt out of the season by Aug. 14. Details for eligibility accommodations in the case a season is canceled or cut short due to COVID-19 \u2014 like the 2020 spring season \u2014 are also required to be shared by Aug. 14. Additional details of the NCAA\u2019s announcement include that if 50% or more of eligible teams in a sport within a division cancel their fall seasons, no fall NCAA championship will occur in that sport. While that applies on the gridiron to FCS teams like JMU and VMI, it doesn\u2019t apply to the FBS because the College Football Playoff is not an NCAA-sanctioned event. Fall Olympic sports do play NCAA championships, however, meaning at least 50% of teams eligible for the NCAA postseason in the sport need to play fall seasons for a NCAA championship to take place. The NCAA left open the possibility of fall sports championships taking place in the spring should any be postponed. Other important guidelines state that schools can\u2019t require student-athletes to waive legal rights regarding the virus to play this fall. Additionally, member schools \u201cmust cover COVID-19 related medical expenses for student-athletes to prevent out-of-pocket expenses for college athletes and their families.\u201d While the NCAA shared a few guidelines and basic principles to follow this fall, the organization firmly shifted the decision-making process onto other entities with its announcement. If a fall sports season is to take place, it\u2019s up to schools, conferences and divisions instead of Mark Emmert and company. \u201cThe first and most important consideration is whether sports can be conducted safely for college athletes,\u201d Michael V. Drake, the chair of the NCAA\u2019s Board of Governors, said in a statement. \u201cEach division must examine whether it has the resources available to take the required precautions given the spread of COVID-19.\u201d For athletes, administrators and coaches, the period of limbo continues. Fall sports might happen, or they might not. That\u2019s up for people outside the NCAA leadership to decide.","473":"Instead of opening the season with Georgia in Atlanta, as originally planned, Bronco Mendenhall and Virginia will face VMI on Friday, Sept. 11 at Scott Stadium to open what\u2019s sure to be an unusual fall season, if it\u2019s played. In Week 2, the Wahoos travel to Blacksburg to face rival Virginia Tech. The full schedule is as follows: Sept. 11: VMI Sept. 19: at Virginia Tech Sept. 26: Bye Oct. 3: at Clemson Oct. 10: N.C. State Oct. 17: at Wake Forest Oct. 24: at Miami Oct. 31: North Carolina Nov. 7: Louisville Nov. 14: Duke Nov. 21: Bye Nov. 28: at Florida State Dec. 5: Boston College Two bye weeks are built into the schedule to add flexibility should games be canceled or postponed due to positive COVID-19 tests within teams. It\u2019s worth noting that the announcement did include UVa\u2019s one nonconference opponent in VMI. It\u2019s unclear if the FCS season will go on, however, given the need for 50% of playoff eligible teams to compete this fall for the FCS playoffs to happen. If the postseason is off the table, would VMI still attempt to play in the fall? Any FCS news over the next month could alter that first matchup. Another interesting element of the schedule is the matchup with Virginia Tech. Typically held on Thanksgiving weekend, the game will be played in Week 2 this season. Virginia and Virginia Tech will compete in Blacksburg in September, as the Cavaliers hope to defend the Commonwealth Cup after a 39-30 win in Charlottesville in November. An added bye week gives the Cavaliers an extra week to prepare for an elite Clemson squad. The Cavaliers play seven games between bye weeks, which could represent a critical stretch. UVa needs to play seven games, including three road contests, while remaining healthy with students on Grounds for those games to occur. It also needs all seven opponents to remain healthy enough to compete in those contests. That stretch could determine the likelihood of the season finishing. The Cavaliers receive bye week No. 2 before facing Florida State. On the field, the bye weeks fall at good times. An extra week to prepare for two of the ACC\u2019s top programs should prove valuable. While the Seminoles look weaker in recent seasons, a road tilt in Tallahassee is rarely easy. The season wraps up on Dec. 5 with a home game against Boston College. The ACC Championship Game, which will feature the two teams with the best conference winning percentage, will take place on either Dec. 12 or Dec. 19 in Charlotte.","474":"Virginia fans woke up Thursday morning, looking forward to the ACC football schedule release. The new opponents and locations were known since the end of July, but the dates weren\u2019t set. Just after 9 a.m., fans learned the Commonwealth Cup was only 44 days away. A wacky 2020 fall schedule brought about by COVID-19 has the Cavaliers playing 10 conference games and just one nonconference foe. After Week 1, the Cavaliers finish the season with 10 ACC games and two bye weeks. The schedule is unusual in many ways, but these five aspects of the revised 2020 slate jump off the page. Week 2 Commonwealth Cup In a normal season UVa fans get heated about playing Virginia Tech. Playing the Hokies in Week 2 during a pandemic only heightens the interest \u2014 and concern. Will the game happen? If so, will either team be playing close to their full potential in Week 2? In recent years, the Cavaliers and Hokies have met on Thanksgiving weekend. It\u2019s a tradition. Instead, they\u2019ll compete in Blacksburg in September. While the fate of the fall season remains a question as of early August, it\u2019s possible that early games are able to be completed while positive COVID-19 case numbers jump later in the season following increased interactions with students and opposing teams. If that happens, UVa and Virginia Tech might play prior to an eventual cancellation. Everyone involved hopes a full fall schedule happens safely, though. If that\u2019s the case, the Cavaliers get one week to prepare for the biggest game on their schedule. Rivalry games typically occur late in the season. That won\u2019t be the case for the Wahoos in 2020. Nonconference uncertainty UVa is scheduled to open the season with VMI, an FCS team and member of the Southern Conference. While the game sits on Virginia\u2019s schedule for Sept. 11, there\u2019s still uncertainty surrounding the likelihood of the contest. VMI stands to make $375,000 from playing the game, but would the program go through with the game if the FCS playoffs are canceled later this month? What happens if the Southern Conference decides not to play football this fall? On Wednesday, the NCAA asked divisions to make decisions on fall sports championships by Aug. 21. Division II and Division III administrators canceled fall sports later that afternoon. The FCS could follow suit by the time the season arrives. Bronco Mendenhall\u2019s team is scheduled to open the season with a Friday game against VMI, but the FCS season faces serious questions with over a month until the UVa-VMI matchup. Both teams want to play the game, but it is unclear how likely that possibility will be by September. Virginia may very well open the season on Sept. 11. There\u2019s still at least some chance the opponent isn\u2019t VMI. Bye week timing From an on-field perspective, UVa\u2019s bye weeks come at ideal times. The Cavaliers receive an open week on Sept. 26, a week before a road game against Clemson. Later in the season, the Wahoos have an off week on Nov. 21. They face Florida State on the road a week later. While Florida State hasn\u2019t been at its program\u2019s peak in recent seasons, the Seminoles are a challenging foe. Bye weeks before Clemson and Florida State give the Cavaliers a good chance to prepare for two of the tougher opponents on the schedule. From a COVID-19 perspective, Virginia plays seven consecutive games without a bye week from Oct. 3-Nov. 14. Three of those games are on the road, including a trip to Miami. Coming out of that stretch without any postponements or cancellations seems like a major challenge. Going seven weeks while interacting with students on Grounds and playing seven different teams increases exposure to the virus. If the ACC keeps contact tracing protocols in place, the Cavaliers could lose an impactful group of players during that stretch. Avoiding an outbreak within the team remains the No. 1 concern entering the season. If a game is canceled or postponed, the Nov. 21 date could be used to reschedule a contest if needed. ACC title hopes Four of UVa\u2019s first six ACC games come on the road. All four of those matchups come against teams that made a bowl game in 2019, and Clemson made the College Football Playoff. Virginia will learn quickly whether it\u2019s good enough to contend for an ACC championship. Games against Virginia Tech, Clemson and North Carolina all come prior to November. Making it through that stretch with only a loss or two comes as a large obstacle. If UVa does survive that gauntlet of games, the Cavaliers end the season with Duke, an open date, Florida State and Boston College. The beginning of the season is a challenge, but the end offers three winnable football games for the \u2018Hoos. Likelihood of a fall season It feels good to talk about fall football. It\u2019s been months without college sports, and the possibility of their return is exciting. On the other hand, the safety of the student-athletes, coaches, team personnel and local community members should take priority over everything else. UVa has delayed undergraduate in-person instruction to Sept. 8 due to COVID-19. Several FCS conferences don\u2019t plan on holding fall football seasons. UConn canceled its fall football season this week, becoming the first FBS program to do so. Several Big Ten programs underwent two-week quarantines due to positive COVID-19 tests within the team. Multiple marquee FBS players decided to sit out this fall, instead focusing on staying healthy ahead of the 2021 NFL Draft. Louisville recently stopped a few sports from practicing due to a coronavirus outbreak stemming from an off-campus party. The schedule announcement looks good on paper, but will any of the games actually happen?","475":"Through a few weeks in the league\u2019s Orlando bubble, play has resumed and the latest results reveal no positive COVID-19 cases. By all accounts, the restart has gone well. Safe play leaves on-the-court storylines to develop. Among those varying storylines are a handful of former Wahoos competing in the playoff chase. When the playoffs begin, several former UVa players will take the court in hopes of winning an NBA title. Let\u2019s check out where the former Cavaliers stand after a few games in the NBA bubble. Malcolm Brogdon The most notable former Virginia player in the bubble scored 20 points in Indiana\u2019s first game in Orlando. He added 12 points in the second game before dropping 25 points against Phoenix in a loss Thursday. He\u2019s been solid for a team preparing for a postseason run. The Pacers are 3-1 since the restart. Joe Harris and Justin Anderson Brooklyn shocked the NBA world Tuesday, beating the Milwaukee Bucks despite missing most of its core. The already depleted roster also played without Caris LeVert and former Wahoo Joe Harris, who sat out with back and hamstring tightness. Given the team\u2019s playoff standing, those games off were for rest more than anything else. Without its key contributors, Brooklyn still pulled the massive upset. The Nets were 19-point underdogs, but they won 119-116 in a game that featured 108 combined 3-point attempts. While Harris sat, former Cavalier Justin Anderson dropped 11 points in 15 minutes. He nailed three shots from beyond the arc and threw down a left-handed slam over likely league MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo. Anderson scored six points Wednesday in a 149-115 loss to the Boston Celtics. Harris, despite sitting out against Milwaukee, has looked good in the NBA\u2019s restart. He scored 14 points in an opening loss to Orlando before a 27-point outburst in an important win over the Wizards. Even in the lopsided defeat to Boston, Harris performed adequately. He added 14 points, six rebounds and a pair of steals in the loss. Brooklyn\u2019s roster is without most of its key stars, putting pressure on Harris to perform at a high level. Mike Scott Scott has yet to take the court during the restart due to right knee soreness. He took shots pregame Wednesday, which may be a sign that he\u2019s ready to return to the court soon for the Philadelphia 76ers. Since the restart, Philadelphia is 2-1 with its only loss coming to Brogdon and the Pacers. The 76ers are firmly in playoff position and would like Scott available off the bench down the stretch. The youngsters Ty Jerome, Kyle Guy and Devon Hall are all on NBA rosters, and Hall played two minutes in Thursday\u2019s game between the Thunder and Lakers. Hall played in garbage time for Oklahoma City in its 105-86 win. Jerome logged one minute in the Suns\u2019 win over Indiana on Thursday. The Suns are making a charge at the playoffs, sitting at 4-0 since the NBA\u2019s restart. With the majority of the players in the bubble remaining healthy, the three young stars aren\u2019t likely to play meaningful minutes in close games. All three guys are bench players and unlikely to crack the rotation in close games, but they may see additional minutes in blowouts. De\u2019Andre Hunter and the Atlanta Hawks were not included in the NBA bubble due to being well out of playoff contention. WNBA In the WNBA bubble, Jocelyn Willoughby continues playing meaningful minutes. Unfortunately, the New York Liberty is struggling mightily without Sabrina Ionescu, who suffered an ankle injury. New York is 0-5 to start the 22-game season. Willoughby has performed well through five games. She\u2019s averaged a shade below 20 minutes per game, scoring six points per contest and adding 2.8 rebounds and a steal each game. She\u2019s shooting 50% from 3-point range to begin her WNBA career. New York was expected to be among the worst teams in the league this season, so the record isn\u2019t much of a surprise. For Willoughby, her first season will likely offer a chance to learn what it takes to compete as a professional. In future seasons, she\u2019ll be part of a young nucleus hoping to contend for titles.","476":"\u201cEvery chance I have to be with my team is a good moment, a good day and is the highlight of each day other than being with my family,\u201d head coach Bronco Mendenhall said in a recent video interview with UVa athletics. \u201cI love these guys and their commitment and their resiliency and their leadership, their culture, their camaraderie. They\u2019re just so much fun to be with, so I\u2019m just glad I\u2019m able to spend more time with them.\u201d The latest round of COVID-19 testing, which was shared on July 31, included no new positive tests. The football team has produced just three positive tests since returning to Charlottesville on July 5. Monday\u2019s practices come roughly one month from the start of the season. The Cavaliers open the season on Sept. 11 against VMI, an FCS opponent. One week later, they travel to Blacksburg to face the Virginia Tech Hokies. Opening with an FCS opponent gives the Cavaliers a chance to ease into the season. VMI\u2019s level of play falls below the level of ACC teams and the game won\u2019t count in the ACC standings. Unfortunately, uncertainty clouds the FCS season as conferences continue to cancel fall football across the subdivision. With a month until the season, it\u2019s unclear if VMI will remain the Week 1 opponent, but Mendenhall does like facing a nonconference foe first. The Cavaliers are one of the five ACC teams opening with a nonconference opponent. Ten teams jump directly into conference action. \u201cI am pleased with a nonconference opener,\u201d Mendenhall said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have spring practice, and there\u2019s been a lot of unknowns. We\u2019re working as fast as we can to accelerate our program and get it ready for this season and so to have a nonconference game to start with seems to fit really well.\u201d The Week 1 game offers a chance to prepare for an important matchup in Week 2 against UVa\u2019s biggest rival. The Cavaliers beat Virginia Tech a season ago, but they haven\u2019t defeated the Hokies in Blacksburg since 1998. \u201cPlaying the Virginia Tech game that early I think maybe gives a sense of hope and optimism to our state, to the commonwealth and maybe to college football,\u201d Mendenhall said. \u201cIf there is to be a season and we are gonna play it, I think having some of those games early on was intentional to maybe add some momentum to the season.\u201d As Mendenhall alluded to in his comments, questions linger about the likelihood of a fall season. The FCS season seems close to being lost, and UConn recently became the first FBS team to withdraw from a fall season. Some FBS players opted out of the season due to COVID-19 concerns. Some did so to prepare for the NFL Draft, while others decided it was best for their health. UVa recently delayed the start of undergraduate in-person instruction until Sept. 8, marking a two-week delay from the original schedule. If a season is to happen, the Cavaliers know their planned schedule. They\u2019re preparing as if everything will move forward as planned. The players were excited to learn the dates of their 2020 games. \u201cMy team cheered when I announced the schedule yesterday,\u201d Mendenhall said. \u201cWhen they saw the dates and they saw the opponents they said, \u2018That just made the bubble easier.\u2019 Life in the bubble is mundane, it\u2019s monotonous. They\u2019re doing a lot of the same things. They\u2019re masking, they\u2019re social distancing, they\u2019re quarantining, they\u2019re staying inside.\u201d Quarantining, receiving frequent COVID-19 tests and preparing for an uncertain season make for an unusually challenging preseason. \u201cLike all of us, they\u2019re wrestling and struggling with that,\u201d Mendenhall said of spending increased time distanced from others. \u201cTo have something solid, some dates that are actually in front of them to shoot for has been helpful.\u201d","477":"Ertz asked high school and college players to write a letter to loved ones telling them how much they appreciate them. He wanted the young athletes to give the letter to their loved ones and film the reaction, later posting it on social media to \u201cbring some hope to people.\u201d In exchange, Ertz offered to break down their film and post the breakdown on YouTube. Within a month of the program starting, the UVa football program\u2019s newest commitment was featured. Ertz dove into the tape of tight end Jack Witmer, who committed to the Wahoos on Wednesday. \u201cHe has a whole five-part series out of him reviewing my film,\u201d Witmer said. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the coolest things I\u2019ve ever had happen.\u201d Witmer wrote his letter to his parents, thanking them for everything they\u2019ve done for him to get to this point. The result was a nice moment with his family and the chance to watch one of the NFL\u2019s best tight ends break down his game tape. \u201cJack is a true wide tight end,\u201d Ertz said in one video. \u201cWhat do I mean by that? Jack is the guy that on first and second down he\u2019s gonna be right next to the tackle. He\u2019s gonna have his hand in the dirt. You\u2019re gonna be able to run the ball right behind him. You\u2019re also gonna have him pass protect on play-action passes. You\u2019re gonna have him run be able to run down the seam off play action passes.\u201d Witmer possesses the physical tools to do exactly what Ertz describes. Witmer\u2019s Twitter bio lists himself at 6-foot-7 and 235 pounds. The Texas native is an athletic competitor with good hands and a commitment to blocking. There are areas for growth in his game, however, and Witmer took Ertz\u2019 advice to heart. \u201cI have room to improve in stuff, and it\u2019s good to hear from someone else and someone as successful as him what I can do to improve,\u201d Witmer said. The tight end wants to improve on the little details from blocking to route running to catching the ball. He knows about the talent gap and need for better play from high school to college and college to the professional ranks. In high school, his team takes advantage of his blocking, frequently running to his side. Given his size and strength, he almost acts as an additional offensive lineman. The combination of blocking and receiving make him a threat in play-action passing. \u201cI\u2019m gonna be able to stretch the field and make a matchup nightmare almost with my height,\u201d Witmer said. A member of UVa\u2019s 2021 recruiting class, there\u2019s still time before Witmer arrives in Charlottesville. When he does, he hopes to develop into a reliable player in Robert Anae\u2019s offense. While UVa didn\u2019t use tight ends as a focal point of its 2019 offense, Witmer\u2019s size makes him an intriguing prospect in future seasons. He hopes to become UVa\u2019s first John Mackey Award winner \u2014 the honor goes to the nation\u2019s top tight end \u2014 since Heath Miller won the honor in 2004. \u201cMy goal is to win the Mackey,\u201d Witmer said. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m going to try to go for in college. If it happens, then let\u2019s do it, but if not it\u2019s not the end of the world, but that\u2019s my goal headed into play tight end for UVa is to go win the Mackey.\u201d Witmer also has big goals in the classroom. Despite living in Texas his whole life, Witmer always considered schools like UVa, Vanderbilt and Stanford as his dream colleges. He plans to major in business, and he wanted an opportunity to play tight end at a Power 5 program with elite academics. UVa fit the mold and offered him a scholarship. Being recruiting during COVID-19 brought with it challenges \u2014 most of his visits and discussions with programs were virtual \u2014 but UVa\u2019s coaches stood out to Witmer. The combination of athletics and academics were an ideal fit. \u201cAfter talking and meeting with their staff, it was just apparent it would be better than any of the other ones no matter what, and I was like, \u2018I can\u2019t just wait and let this pass by, I gotta do it,\u2019\u201d Witmer said. It\u2019s been quite the month for Witmer, who committed to a dream university while receiving tips from one of the best in the world at his position.","478":"Wednesday marks three years since Heather Heyer\u2019s murder. Aug. 11 and Aug. 12 serve as reminders of the Unite the Right white supremacist rally that took place in Charlottesville, and for some outside the community, it was a defining moment for the city. Virginia\u2019s football program wants to be a catalyst for change in the community, helping to turn the pain of Aug. 12 into a celebration of life, love and unity. The team wants Charlottesville to be defined by much more than the white supremacists who visited three summers ago. Athletes and coaches want people to remember Heyer \u2014 a counter protester at the Unite the Right rally \u2014 for who she was and what she was fighting for when she was killed. With Heyer\u2019s memory in mind and inspired by the deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and others, the UVa football program created a group called the \u201cGroundskeepers.\u201d The group of about 20 people, including players and staff members, aims to bring the Charlottesville and UVa communities together. In its first effort to unite the community, the group is participating in small marches from Heather Heyer Way to The Rotunda in an effort to \u201cTake Back Our Grounds.\u201d \u201cThey were protests led in the name of hatred, racism, oppression, and that\u2019s harmful,\u201d Virginia senior linebacker Charles Snowden said of the Unite the Right rally. \u201cThat\u2019s hurtful to a lot of people, and that\u2019s not what the City of Charlottesville stands for, it\u2019s definitely not what the University of Virginia stands for and the Groundskeepers here at UVa, we just want to show that.\u201d Snowden and others want to take back Aug. 12. They want to honor Heyer and the community by turning the day into a celebration of love and acceptance. \u201cThat\u2019s not at all who we are, and that\u2019s not what we stand for,\u201d Snowden said in a video posted to social media. \u201cJust trying to take back the power of those days and show that we stand for love, unity, respect, uplifting one another and just doing what\u2019s right.\u201d When the team came up with the idea in March, it wanted to march as a team and invite the community out for a march on Aug. 12. Unfortunately, with COVID-19 still a significant threat in the region, gathering in large groups remains a possible health risk. Instead, members of the team opted to perform the march in groups of five while wearing masks and practicing social distancing. Snowden and wide receivers coach Marques Hagans were among those who marched in small groups Sunday. \u201cNot being able to march because of the pandemic, it really \u2014 I don\u2019t want to say it devastated us \u2014 but it was a disappointing blow because we had this big vision of the whole community coming together marching back from where Heather Heyer lost her life to the Grounds,\u201d Hagans said. \u201cIt didn\u2019t unfold that way because how the virus has played out, so our thought was instead of abandoning the plan, let\u2019s just adjust it.\u201d That adjusted plan still includes the community. In coming days, the Groundskeepers plan to share the path of their route, encouraging others to make the same march in small groups while distanced. Hagans and Groundskeepers want people to document their march in some way, whether it\u2019s by tracking the walk using a phone app or taking photographs. They ask others to post photos or videos and share why the march matters to them, using the hashtag #TakeBackOurGrounds. Eventually, the group plans to create a flag for people who completed the march. Those who take part in the walk will sign the flag, and the team will carry the flag onto the field with them for every football game, serving as a constant reminder to the community of the importance of being unified in love rather than hate. The group also plans to distribute wristbands to those who complete the march. They hope people see others in the community wearing them, signaling that others are fighting for the same change in the world. Hagans hopes the march becomes a Charlottesville tradition, helping to turn Aug. 12 into a celebration of Heyer\u2019s life and what the community can be when it\u2019s united. \u201cOur whole thing is not to just create immediate change and then like a year from now it\u2019s forgotten,\u201d Hagans said. \u201cOur players, man, they are amazing at coming up with ideas and things that will create a legacy. The thought was not only would we do this on the anniversary of August the 12th, but this is something that we would do every year.\u201d The march, which starts at Heather Heyer Way, passes by UVa\u2019s Memorial to Enslaved Laborers, which acknowledges enslaved African Americans who built and maintained the university. Acknowledging the university\u2019s slave-owning past is part of the \u201cTake Back Our Grounds\u201d message shared by the Groundskeepers. Hagans loves that the memorial was built and believes part of moving forward is acknowledging the past and understanding the role it played in making Virginia what it is today. \u201cThat makes me proud,\u201d Hagans said. \u201cThat makes me understand that there\u2019s hope and there\u2019s progress and we just gotta keep fighting for change and make sure it\u2019s consistent and those people\u2019s struggles and tough times don\u2019t go unheard, don\u2019t go untold and they get celebrated because they were here.\u201d The Groundskeepers weren\u2019t created to erase memories of Charlottesville\u2019s past. The group wants to bring attention to the past of the university and the city, using the area\u2019s history as powerful reminders of necessary growth. \u201cThey are a part of the University of Virginia,\u201d Hagans said of the enslaved laborers. \u201cWe win a national championship those people are a part of it because they helped build it. All those things are a part of all of us and we just gotta make sure we never lose sight of that.\u201d Three years after white supremacists came into town, casting Charlottesville in a negative light, the UVa football Groundskeepers want to show everyone what the community and university truly stand for.","479":"Atariwa plays defensive tackle and will be immediately eligible with one year of eligibility remaining. JMU announced the postponement of its fall football season Friday. Towson, also a CAA school, won\u2019t play football this fall either due to COVID-19. With UVa still planning on competing this fall, Atariwa and Simpson opted to join the Wahoos. \u201cExcited to announce that I will be attending THE University of Virginia to continue my football and academic career!\u201d Atariwa wrote on Twitter. \u201cI am grateful to all of the support which has made the decision making process easy. Looking forward to being a part of the Cavalier culture.\u201d Atariwa shined during his time at the FCS level. He started 23 games over the past two seasons, helping the Dukes reach the FCS National Championship Game in 2019. Atariwa finished the 2019 season with 52 tackles and 13 tackles for loss. He played a major role on JMU\u2019s defensive line, which was one of the most disruptive at the FCS level in 2019. The Dukes ranked third nationally in scoring defense in 2019, and the team led the nation in total tackles for loss during the year. Atariwa played an important part in that effort. Listed at 6-foot-3 and roughly 280 pounds, Atariwa possesses solid size. While he isn\u2019t the largest defensive tackle, he uses a good blend of strength and quickness to maneuver past offensive linemen. Atariwa adds depth to a solid defensive line. Jowon Briggs is expected to star at nose tackle, but Atariwa is capable of lining up in that position as well. He\u2019s also versatile enough to play on the end of the defensive line, providing additional depth for players like Aaron Faumui, Richard Burney and Mandy Alonso. The Cavaliers continue to add FCS prospects with NFL aspirations looking to find a home for the fall.","480":"A couple hours after adding James Madison graduate transfer Adeeb Atariwa, the Virginia football program added another Duke to its roster on Sunday. D\u2019Angelo Amos, a safety and punt returner, joins the Cavaliers with one year of immediate eligibility. JMU announced Friday that it won\u2019t play football this fall due to COVID-19. Amos and Atariwa both have NFL aspirations, and they hope UVa can move forward with its fall schedule as currently scheduled. Amos excelled as a punt returner at JMU, finishing his career with 1,259 career punt yards. He returned five punts for touchdowns during his career, including three in 2018. He returned two punts for touchdowns in a 2018 victory over Villanova. While Amos drew headlines for his return ability, he developed into a consistent defensive back during his JMU career. He earned All-CAA honors as a safety and punt returner in 2019, helping the Dukes reach the FCS National Championship Game. He blocked three kicks and recorded 57 tackles in 2019, while also making a pair of interceptions. Those were the first interceptions of his JMU career. The addition of Amos marks the third CAA addition for the Cavaliers this month. The Cavaliers added Atariwa on Sunday, and Shane Simpson transferred from Towson last Sunday. Simpson and Amos both add dynamic ability in the return game. With Joe Reed gone to the NFL, the Cavaliers can give the FCS transfers a shot to compete for kick returning duties. Both players also perform well at punt returner and should have chances to earn playing time. Defensively, the Cavaliers return solid experience in the secondary, but Amos is a reliable performer with solid experience. Depending on how fast he learns the defensive system, he could compete immediately for playing time. At the very least, Amos adds depth on defense and playmaking ability in the return game.","481":"Bronco Mendenhall\u2019s Virginia football team is supposed to start its season in a month. His top daily focus isn\u2019t on Xs and Os or game plans, though. Mendenhall\u2019s mind is on mental health. \u201cQuite frankly, maybe the biggest competitive work is the psychology of just trying to care for the mental health of our team and keep them positive and optimistic and focusing on just one horizon at a time, and again, what they can influence and focusing on that because there\u2019s so many things we can\u2019t, even though they\u2019re occupying our thoughts,\u201d Mendenhall told the media Monday. The worries outside the UVa football program\u2019s control include the fall schedule, cancellations and postponements. Numerous reports suggest Power 5 football conferences will postpone or cancel fall football seasons in the coming days. This leaves UVa to wonder about what\u2019s next. The football program opened camp Friday, but will it make it to its first game on Sept. 11? \u201cI think the most significant mental challenge college athletes are facing is the uncertainty,\u201d Eric Bean, an executive board member for the Association of Applied Sport Psychology, said. \u201cThere\u2019s still a significant amount of unknowns to what their sport is going to look like, what the bench setup is going to look like, to are they going to have social distance on the bench, to are their parents going to be allowed to attend, to are they only going to play in conference?\u201d Other concerns stem from health protocols. The UVa sports bubble has largely kept the virus from infecting student-athletes \u2014 the athletic department announced Monday that there were no new positive tests in its latest round of COVID-19 testing \u2014 but there are still health concerns for the Wahoos. Brady Feeney, an offensive lineman for Indiana, is dealing with health complications after a battle with COVID-19. Eduardo Rodrigues, a pitcher for the Boston Red Sox, is done for the MLB season after COVID-19 led to heart inflammation. While high-level student-athletes don\u2019t face as many health risks as older populations, they\u2019re not immune to impacts from COVID-19. Athletes have little to no control over how their fall season will look. Will games be played? If not, will student-athletes stay on campus or will classes eventually be moved online only for the semester? If a player tests positive, will they face long-term health effects? All of the unknown questions lead to uncertainty. Bean, who has a Ph.D. in sports and exercise psychology from Michigan State, says those feelings can lead to anxiety, stress and even a little bit of fear. To combat those emotions, Bean recommends something coaches preach all the time. Control what you can control. \u201cThat\u2019s one area I would look at is to really make sure that they\u2019re maximizing control over what they have control over and not spending too much time on what they don\u2019t have control over,\u201d Bean said. That\u2019s something Adeeb Atariwa, a recent graduate transfer into Virginia\u2019s football program, takes to heart. After JMU suspended its fall football season, he made the decision to transfer. The defensive tackle decided to join UVa. With NFL aspirations, Atariwa wants a chance to play this fall. He knows that\u2019s far from certain, even in the ACC. At the very least, he wants a chance to compete daily against Power 5 opponents ahead of potential NFL Draft preparation. \u201cIt\u2019s been really tough mentally, but what\u2019s been helping is knowing that I can only control what I can control, anything outside of that is beyond me,\u201d Atariwa said. \u201cI can\u2019t control how different leagues react to coronavirus and things like that, but I can control where I\u2019m at and what I can do. I know that I will be working hard on the field and off the field at UVa the entire time that I\u2019m there.\u201d Atariwa likes the academic offerings at UVa, and he hopes being viewed as a Power 5 defensive lineman can help his potential draft stock. He controlled his college choice and decided UVa made the most sense for his career goals moving forward. Bean also recommends athletes avoid constantly reading news headlines about the status of the fall season. Instead, try to block out the noise and focus on the daily activities within the team and eventually within academic life. \u201cMost of the time, if you need to know something, you\u2019re going to know it,\u201d Bean said. \u201cSomebody\u2019s going to call you; somebody\u2019s going to tell you. If there has been a definitive change in the status quo, you\u2019re going to know it, so reduce your intake of news.\u201d This leaves athletes with time to focus on practice and spending time \u2013 albeit socially distanced time \u2013 with teammates and coaches. Virginia\u2019s football program is doing its best to combat stress and anxiety by focusing on positives of each day. Until told otherwise, the team plans on competing and training. The Cavaliers also plan on enjoying themselves. \u201cI\u2019ve worked hard to frame this time period not in relation to if we\u2019ll play or if we won\u2019t play, but to how much growth can we accomplish daily,\u201d Mendenhall said. \u201cWhat kind of circumstances and what kind of program can I provide for growth that will be meaningful and also how much fun can I have our players have daily in the meantime. That\u2019s helped make some sense of the circumstances we\u2019ve been under for some time.\u201d Interestingly, the mental health of athletes might be better off now than in a few months should classes move online and sports be canceled this fall. Currently, several UVa athletic programs are preparing for fall seasons on Grounds. They\u2019re working out in teams and receiving frequent COVID-19 tests. There\u2019s comfort given the fitness routine and health protocols in place. \u201cWe know that when athletes and non-athletes alike work out, endorphins are released, and they usually are associated with some positive feelings and some feelings of a sense of control over their life,\u201d Bean said. In addition to the mental health benefits of training, there\u2019s the added benefit of seeing teammates in-person for the first time in months. \u201cIt\u2019s been so long since our team has been together,\u201d UVa women\u2019s soccer head coach Steve Swanson said. \u201cThere\u2019s this joy of being together again. That\u2019s been quite motivating, inspiring.\u201d Swanson says his group, which reached No. 1 in the country at a point last season, understands more about why they enjoy playing as a team. He says it\u2019s about being together, working toward a goal and building relationships. At the same time, the Cavaliers don\u2019t even have a fall schedule yet. They might never get one. While the football team at least has a potential date to circle on the calendar, the women\u2019s soccer team doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s next. The focus lies on keeping the bubble safe. Swanson wants players and coaches to remain vigilant to help prevent the spread of the virus. After that, they\u2019re just trying to play soccer and have fun. Uncertainty surrounding a fall season can lead to stress and anxiety among student-athletes. From the outside, it feels like a cancelation of the fall seasons is inevitable. Both James Madison and Old Dominion canceled fall sports seasons Monday. Reports indicate Power 5 conferences might soon follow suit. That may very well be the correct decision to make from a health standpoint. If it is, UVa\u2019s athletic teams will accept that fate. For the Virginia athletes currently on Grounds, though, those nervous and uncertain feelings are somewhat mitigated \u2014 at least for now \u2014 by the joy of reuniting with teammates and playing the sport they love. \u201cYou can really see the effect of being a part of a team and having a positive environment to the day-to-day mental health,\u201d Swanson said.","482":"The Virginia athletics department announced the results from its latest round of COVID-19 testing on Monday. There were no new positive COVID-19 test results of the student-athletes tested. Since the football team arrived to Grounds on July 5, a total of 238 student-athletes have been tested for COVID-19. Four student-athletes have produced a positive result. There has not been a positive result announced since the report shared by UVa on July 24. None of the student-athletes who tested positive for the virus required hospitalization, according to the program\u2019s release. The athletic department says it will continue to provide periodic testing updates. Prior to Monday\u2019s announcement, the latest update was provided on July 31. There\u2019s uncertainty surrounding the fall sports season, but UVa\u2019s sports bubble seems to be working. Seven athletic programs \u2014 men\u2019s and women\u2019s soccer, men\u2019s and women\u2019s basketball, field hockey, football and volleyball \u2014 are currently on Grounds preparing for potential fall seasons. No positive test results have been announced from any program within the group of seven since the July 24 report. Of the 238 student-athletes tested, 112 football players have been tested for the virus. Three have produced positive results. This means 126 student-athletes from the other six sports have combined to produce a single positive test. The results are impressive across the board for the Virginia athletics program. \u201cI think we\u2019ve done a great job with our program in this virtual bubble for the time being,\u201d Bronco Mendenhall told the media Monday. Mendenhall also cautioned that student-athletes will be asked to leave the bubble once in-person instruction begins and students return to Charlottesville by the thousands. Once that happens, it\u2019s more of a challenge to keep athletes safe from the virus. Until then, however, the positive COVID-19 test results remain low for UVa athletics.","483":"College football players want to play. Across the nation, players have voiced their desire to play this fall using the hashtag \u201c#WeWantToPlay.\u201d Clemson quarterback Trevor Lawrence has led the charge, posting why he believes college football should take place this fall. Virginia head coach Bronco Mendenhall has heard the argument and agrees that players should have a voice. He also knows comments from coaches, administrators or players come from narrow viewpoints. The views of student-athletes, coaches, school administrators and health experts all must be considered in the decision-making process. \u201cI\u2019m glad we have those voices,\u201d Mendenhall said Monday of student-athletes speaking out. \u201cI\u2019m glad we have that input, but that alone doesn\u2019t choose, as that\u2019s only one portion of the collective, and this is a collective issue.\u201d It\u2019s an issue that spans outside the UVa sports bubble. To this point, UVa\u2019s athletic department deserves praise for keeping COVID-19 case numbers low. In its latest round of testing, which was announced Monday, the athletic department announced no new positives. Since teams arrived to Grounds on July 5, 238 student-athletes have been tested for COVID-19. Four student-athletes produced positive tests and none of them required hospitalization, according to the latest results announced Monday. The athletic department has reported zero positive tests since its July 24 report. \u201cWe have done a very good job of controlling that component,\u201d Mendenhall said of the bubble, \u201chowever that does not reflect the community spread. It doesn\u2019t reflect the nationwide numbers and it doesn\u2019t reflect the worldwide pandemic. And football is secondary to all of those things in my opinion. And so this, to me, isn\u2019t a football issue. This is a worldwide issue and a national issue, and a state issue and a community issue.\u201d Virginia\u2019s test results within its bubble are impressive. Seven athletic programs are on Grounds, and the group reported zero positive COVID-19 test results in each of its two most recent rounds of announced results. Those numbers mimic what we\u2019ve seen within the WNBA, NBA and NHL bubbles. Low results offer encouragement as the Cavaliers opened camp Monday and players across the country posted online about wanting to play this fall. Unfortunately for UVa sports fans, the Cavaliers can\u2019t replicate the current bubble situation when players need to attend in-person classes this fall. Students returning to Grounds increase the risk of exposure for the student-athletes. Interacting with students who aren\u2019t tested regularly for the virus can lead to asymptomatic spread of the virus within the campus community. This could potentially lead to student-athletes contracting the virus outside the realm of athletic activity. Positive tests require athletes to quarantine, and players in close contact to student-athletes who test positive must self-isolate for 14 days under the current guidelines. Any positive tests threaten to derail the 2020 season and schedule. Additionally, unknowns still exist about the virus. Without more research regarding long-term health effects, it\u2019s unclear how the virus can potentially harm student-athletes in future weeks, months and potentially years. \u201cOnce students arrive and our players are asked to go outside the bubble to class, outside the bubble for residence, it becomes an entirely different management issue which the world and the nation hasn\u2019t solved,\u201d Mendenhall said. \u201cSo, everyone has said health and safety is first and foremost. I\u2019m exactly there and so I think we\u2019ve done a great job with our program in this virtual bubble for the time being. That does not mean it\u2019s sustainable of lasting or anyone else has a handle on it to this point.\u201d As players like Lawrence and even prominent politicians, like U.S. President Donald Trump, tweet about wanting to see fall college football, Mendenhall doesn\u2019t like what he\u2019s seen from the virus in recent weeks. \u201cThe numbers nationally and the numbers worldwide just don\u2019t seem to reflect progress,\u201d Mendenhall said. \u201cAnd so regardless of how well we do within football, I have to acknowledge that as well.\u201d UVa\u2019s head coach says he feels confident in how the program has handled testing and health protocols. He\u2019s pleased with the university\u2019s efforts to keep athletes safe, but he\u2019s also unsure about the likelihood of a fall season. James Madison and Old Dominion postponed fall sports seasons Monday. The Mountain West Conference and MAC are two FBS leagues that have postponed fall football. Mendenhall said Monday morning he\u2019s unsure of where the ACC currently stands, but he won\u2019t be shocked by any change. Like March, prior to the cancellation of spring sports, the situation feels unsteady. \u201cI know the word everyone uses is fluid,\u201d Mendenhall said. \u201cI don\u2019t know a better word for that. Turbulent. Turbulent might be a better word than fluid. It changes so quickly and so rapidly and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to have decisions made today, tomorrow, next week in relation to where we stand.\u201d","484":"Reports surfaced Monday saying the Big Ten and Pac-12 may postpone fall sports. On Tuesday, those reports came true. First, the Big Ten postponed its fall sports season. \u201cThe mental and physical health and welfare of our student-athletes has been at the center of every decision we have made regarding the ability to proceed forward,\u201d Big Ten Commissioner Kevin Warren said in a statement. \u201cAs time progressed and after hours of discussion with our Big Ten Task Force for Emerging and Infectious Diseases and the Big Ten Sports Medicine Committee, it became abundantly clear that there was too much uncertainty regarding potential medical risks to allow our student-athletes to compete this fall.\u201d Roughly an hour later, the Pac-12 announced a similar decision. The Pac-12 took the decision a step further, however. The league suspended all athletic competition in 2020, meaning its basketball seasons won\u2019t begin in November. The Big Ten shared that winter and spring sports will continue to be evaluated. The league will also determine at a later time if postponed fall sports can compete in the spring. \u201cUltimately, our decision was guided by science with a deep commitment to the health and welfare of student-athletes,\u201d University of Oregon President Michael H. Schill said of the Pac-12\u2019s decision. \u201cWe certainly hope that the Pac-12 will be able to return to competition in the New Year.\u201d Elsewhere, other leagues aren\u2019t on the same page as the Big Ten and Pac-12, at least not yet. UVa\u2019s conference, the ACC, released a statement Tuesday saying it is going to continue on its current path. The ACC stressed its commitment to the safety of those within athletic departments. \u201cThe ACC will continue to make decisions based on medical advice, inclusive of our Medical Advisory Group, local and state health guidelines, and do so in a way that appropriately coincides with our universities\u2019 academic missions,\u201d the league said in a statement. \u201cThe safety of our students, staff and overall campus communities will always be our top priority, and we are pleased with the protocols being administered on our 15 campuses.\u201d Shortly after the ACC released its statement, the SEC joined in, echoing the ACC\u2019s sentiments. \u201cI look forward to learning more about the factors that led the Big Ten and Pac-12 leadership to take these actions today,\u201d SEC Commissioner Greg Sankey said in a statement. \u201cI remain comfortable with the thorough and deliberate approach that the SEC and our 14 members are taking to support a healthy environment for our student-athletes.\u201d Much like the ACC, the SEC plans to continue to allow programs to prepare on campuses in preparation for a fall sports season. \u201cWe will continue to further refine our policies and protocols for a safe return to sports as we monitor developments around COVID-19 in a continued effort to support, educate and care for our student-athletes every day,\u201d Sankey said. With the SEC and ACC holding still in the commitment to play, it leaves the Big 12 as the other Power 5 league in play. The league has reportedly decided to continue pursuing a fall season. All of the Power 5 leagues emphasize the importance of safety, but the medical officials within different leagues appear to have varying opinions about the safety of competing in the fall. Virginia currently has seven athletic programs back on grounds, and the athletic department hasn\u2019t reported a positive COVID-19 case since its July 24 report. UVa released its latest information Monday, with the programs reporting no new positive tests. \u201cWe will continue to follow our process that has been in place for months and has served us well,\u201d the ACC\u2019s statement said. \u201cWe understand the need to stay flexible and be prepared to adjust as medical information and the landscape evolves.\u201d As his been the case for much of the last few months, the situation remains fluid.","485":"ACC Olympic Sports competition can begin on Sept. 10. With less than a month until the season, the Virginia volleyball team still doesn\u2019t have a schedule. Uncertainty surrounding fall sports due to COVID-19 leaves the program in a state of uncertainty. The Cavaliers are preparing in hopes of a fall season starting on time. \u201cWe\u2019re just dealing with what we know is in front of us,\u201d head coach Aaron Smith said in late July. \u201cWe don\u2019t know exactly what the future holds but that is just training and being ready for August.\u201d The Wahoos hope to learn their schedule soon, and when they do, they\u2019re looking to turn the corner as a program. They haven\u2019t put together a winning season since 2015-16, and they want that streak to end. Last season\u2019s results Virginia finished the season with a 13-18 record, including a 5-13 mark in conference play. The 8-5 record in nonconference matches is respectable, but the Cavaliers struggled against ACC foes. Only Wake Forest and Virginia Tech finished the 2019 season with worse conference records. Injuries to key players hurt Virginia during conference play and made the Wahoos\u2019 record worse than it could have been with full health. The team also ended the season with a pair of victories, including a win over a Boston College squad that went 20-12. \u201cI think there\u2019s a lot of momentum with that in our staff and the team\u2019s eyes going into this year,\u201d Smith said. Despite a record below .500, there are positives to build upon entering the fall of 2020. On the flip side, UVa did lose 18 matches and 11 of those 18 losses were sweeps. The Cavaliers need to improve their game this fall to post a winning record, especially with the potential for a limited nonconference schedule because of the coronavirus. Notable departures The Cavaliers lose four seniors to graduation. Those seniors \u2014 Kelsey Miller, Jelena Novakovic, Chino Anukwuem and Jennifer Wineholt \u2014 were all major contributors in 2019. Novakovic led the team in kills a season ago, and she also performed well as a server. She led the squad with 42 aces. Miller suffered a knee injury in early October that ended her career. When healthy, she was an important piece of UVa\u2019s roster. She finished her career 10th on the Virginia all-time digs list. Anukwuem played in 15 matches, adding value as a middle blocker. She had 10 blocks in the late-season win over Boston College. Wineholt provided solid depth and consistent play as a setter. She tallied an impressive 31 assists in the first match of the 2019 season against Furman. Losing that group certainly leaves the Cavaliers with holes on the roster. Notable returners Despite losing four valuable contributors, the Wahoos enter the fall season with four rising seniors. There\u2019s experience on the roster, including Sarah Billiard, who led the team in sets played in 2019. During the past few months, the coaches focused on film review with the team. In a hectic season, there\u2019s usually limited time to explain why the team follows certain strategies. During quarantine, the coaches made sure to teach the players why they do things. \u201cI think that learning why we do what we do just gives it a full encompassing understanding,\u201d Billiard said. \u201cI think that\u2019s gonna be really helpful for us and a huge advantage for us when we go into the season.\u201d Billiard feels confident in the team\u2019s returning talent, and she believes the added understanding of the team\u2019s schemes and strategies will only prove beneficial. The three other seniors \u2013 Alex Spencer, Christine Jarman and Megan Wilson \u2013 should play key roles in 2020. All three possess meaningful experience at the ACC level. After relying on seniors in 2019, the Cavaliers can do the same in 2020. Look for junior Milla Ciprian to earn meaningful playing time at middle blocker. She led the team in blocks in 2019. Mattison Matthews \u2014 a middle blocker \u2014 headlines a talented sophomore class. She appeared in 28 matches last season, breaking the UVa freshman hitting record in the process. Just about every returner on the roster has meaningful playing experience at UVa. Key additions Virginia adds five freshmen to its roster. The group doesn\u2019t need to star in 2020 given the experience on the roster, but the group adds energy to the 2020 squad. \u201cI am so excited for them,\u201d Billiard said. \u201cI have loved getting to know each and every one of them and they all have such big personalities, and they all are so fun. I think they\u2019re gonna mesh well with the rest of us returners just fine.\u201d Smith mentioned Mary Shaffer, an Ohio product, as one of the freshmen he\u2019s excited to see. While not every freshmen needs to play a major role, Shaffer possesses the experience at the club level to compete for time on the court. 2020-21 outlook Virginia wants a winning record. COVID-19 might make that more challenging in terms of the schedule \u2014 which figures to be shorter than most seasons with a heavy emphasis on ACC matches \u2014 but the time spent at home could benefit the Cavaliers. The coaching staff believes it used months away from Charlottesville to improve through film study and general conversations via Zoom. They hope that propels them to one of their best seasons in recent memory. \u201cI feel really good about the progress that we made during that time,\u201d Smith said. \u201cI think we got a lot closer, we learned a lot about ourselves and about each other, and I think it really is going to put us in a good spot when we\u2019re able to get back on the court together.\u201d","486":"Tuesday saw a pair of Power 5 conferences postpone their fall football seasons. The Big Ten and Pac-12 announced the cancellation of fall football games, while the ACC, Big 12 and SEC remain committed to pressing forward with a potential fall season. That means powerhouse programs such as Michigan, Ohio State and USC won\u2019t play football games this fall. Virginia, however, continues to prepare for the season despite constant uncertainty. \u201cObviously, we\u2019re not oblivious to what\u2019s going on in college football right now, but I think Coach [Bronco Mendenhall] has said it best multiple times, \u2018control the controllables,\u2019\u201d Virginia defensive line coach Clint Sintim said Wednesday. \u201cRight now, we\u2019ve all been given an opportunity to come out here and practice and play football, and for me to coach football, so we\u2019re all doing what we love and until we hear otherwise, that\u2019s what we\u2019re gonna keep doing and we\u2019re gonna keep marching away.\u201d Virginia started fall camp Monday, and it has practiced this week as a team. The Cavaliers hope to play their fall season, which is slated to begin on Sept. 11 with a matchup against VMI. With many FCS conferences opting not to play this fall, it\u2019s unclear if the Wahoos will ultimately open the season with VMI in Week 1, despite the current schedule. Almost everything about the fall season remains murky. Fall camp comes as a challenge to student-athletes in normal seasons. Coaches push players during this time to help them get into elite physical shape, while also wanting to determine the depth chart through positional battles. Competition is frequent, and it\u2019s a physical and mental grind. Add in the uncertainty of whether a season can safely happen in the fall, and it\u2019s a unique challenge facing college athletes. For UVa\u2019s athletes, the focus remains on football and staying in the moment. \u201cWith something like this, with COVID going around and everything, it\u2019s just a day at a time,\u201d sophomore defensive tackle Jowon Briggs said. \u201cCan I make myself better the next day? Can I make myself better today? I\u2019m not really looking forward weeks from now, I\u2019m really just focused on how I can act, how I can train the day I\u2019m at right now.\u201d The student-athletes find the practices to be an enjoyable distraction. Unsurprisingly, Division I football players fresh off a 2019 Orange Bowl appearance enjoy football. Wanting to play doesn\u2019t mean the season will happen in the fall, but the decision is out of the control of Virginia\u2019s players. They\u2019re making the most of time spent around teammates under strict health protocols. \u201cEvery other conference, they make their own decisions, but what we\u2019re focused on is Virginia football and how we can get better, so it\u2019s felt normal to me,\u201d sixth-year defensive lineman Richard Burney said. \u201cWe\u2019re out here practicing with the guys, and it\u2019s fun.\u201d Scrolling through social media delivers a steady stream of college sports news. One hour, a league cancels fall games. Another hour, a league releases a statement standing by its health protocols and the potential for a fall athletic season. The seemingly endless flow of news adds to the uneasy feeling surrounding fall athletics. Virginia\u2019s players don\u2019t seem to pay the frequent headlines much attention. \u201cI\u2019m the kind of guy that kind of keeps tunnel vision as far as this goes,\u201d Briggs said Wednesday. \u201cI know I\u2019m in the ACC. I know we\u2019re playing football, and I know tomorrow I have practice, so I\u2019m gonna act accordingly. I\u2019m gonna prepare my body tonight, wake up in the morning and go to practice.\u201d","487":"In late June, between the first and second rounds at the Travelers Championship, however, McCarthy woke up feeling ill. The former University of Virginia men\u2019s golfer took a test for COVID-19, and it came back positive. He withdrew from the tournament. \u201cMy body was just a little weak, achy, sore, bad headache, fever and chills for a day and a half and then lost my smell and taste for about four or five days after that, but felt fine during that time,\u201d McCarthy said. \u201cIt was a little weird not being able to taste or smell anything but got that back and a week after my initial positive test, I was back to normal.\u201d McCarthy compared his experience to that of the flu, saying he felt lousy for a day or two but ultimately recovered quickly, aside from the inability to smell or taste. It was unusual, but his senses returned after a few days and his focus quickly shifted to rejoining the tournament swing. The return was a bit unusual, too. McCarthy recovered quickly but still produced positive COVID-19 tests after feeling better. Under the PGA Tour\u2019s guidelines, he was allowed to play because he underwent 10 days of isolation and 72 hours without a fever or respiratory issues. He had to play under restrictions, however, playing by himself during a tournament in early July. Finally, the negative tests came through and he was able to use locker rooms and return to a more typical experience playing golf on the PGA Tour. \u201cI just happened to fall in that boat where I would pass the saliva test, but the nasal swab kept coming back positive for whatever reason,\u201d McCarthy said. \u201cIt was a little strange. It was a little discouraging, you know, I\u2019m waiting for results three weeks after my initial positive test, and I\u2019m thinking it\u2019s going to be negative and it kept coming back positive. It was a little frustrating, but dealt with it as best as I could and just tried to focus on my golf game.\u201d McCarthy\u2019s game seems to be rounding into form now that he\u2019s returned to a standard schedule for the PGA Tour\u2019s restart. After missing the cut at the Workday Charity Open \u2014 his first event back after his positive COVID-19 test \u2014 McCarthy has made the cut in four consecutive events, including the first major of the season last week. He finished in a tie for 58th at the PGA Championship, carding an impressive three eagles along the way. \u201cI mean, I\u2019m not known for making a ton of eagles, but I made one at the Barracuda [Championship] the week before and then I made three this past week, which was nice, but unfortunately I didn\u2019t play the rest of the golf course all that great,\u201d McCarthy said. He finished the week at 2-over par, but he shot even par or better in three of his four rounds. McCarthy admits that despite some sloppy shots, his game is trending in the right direction. Putting never causes concern for McCarthy, who leads the entire PGA Tour in strokes gained putting this year. Ball striking tends to be the issue. While he doesn\u2019t hit the ball as far as other professionals, McCarthy feels like he\u2019s turning the corner with his iron play. He\u2019s recently worked on using his feet more productively in the golf swing, generating power from the ground. The result is more confidence in his irons. \u201cI like the way that the shots are coming off the last few weeks,\u201d McCarthy said. \u201cI\u2019ve hit a lot of really quality shots, a few loose ones here or there that I\u2019d like to clean up, but for the most part I really like this new feeling that I\u2019m using to get through the ball a little bit better.\u201d The former Cavalier feels confident heading into this week\u2019s Wyndham Championship at Sedgefield Country Club in North Carolina. McCarthy knows the course from playing it as a junior and in each of the last two seasons as a professional. In 2018, he finished in a tie for 36th at the event. In 2019, he improved on that finish, ending the tournament tied for 22nd. He finished the tournament with all four rounds in the 60s, including a pair of 65s. With the FedEx Cup Playoffs starting next week, McCarthy could\u2019ve opted to skip this week in preparation for The Northern Trust. Instead, he\u2019s teeing it up Thursday in hopes of improving his FedEx Cup standing by contending for his first PGA Tour victory at a course that typically yields birdies in bunches. \u201cI\u2019ve played plenty of competitive rounds on this course, and if it weren\u2019t a course that I liked, I probably would have taken this week off, but since I\u2019m familiar with it, I like where my game\u2019s trending, I like the things I\u2019m working on, I figured I might as well just play this week,\u201d McCarthy said. \u201cI like my chances to have a really solid week.\u201d","488":"After Clint Sintim\u2019s professional playing career came to a close, the former Virginia linebacker pursued a career in coaching. He always hoped that journey would bring him back to Charlottesville. \u201cSince I retired and I got into coaching, the goal was always to come back here to Virginia and be on the staff in some capacity and make a contribution,\u201d Sintim told the media Wednesday. Sintim\u2019s coaching career began as an outside linebackers and special teams coach for West Alabama, a Division II program, in 2014. Most recently, he served under Danny Rocco at Richmond and Delaware. He primarily coached outside linebackers during that stretch. In February, during the college football offseason, Sintim\u2019s dreams took a step closer to becoming a reality. Then-UVa defensive line coach Vic So\u2019oto accepted the same position at USC, leaving an opening on Bronco Mendenhall\u2019s staff. Mendenhall interviewed Sintim, then offered him a job on his coaching staff. Now the former UVa standout is back in Charlottesville, coaching the Cavaliers\u2019 defensive line. Clearly, both parties are excited about Sintim\u2019s addition to the staff. \u201cWhen coach gave me that call in mid-February to come down and interview, my wife and I came down, we met with the staff, and then shortly after when he offered me a job, it didn\u2019t take much to say, \u2018We\u2019re coming,\u2019\u201d Sintim said. \u201cI\u2019m excited to be here. I\u2019m excited to contribute and whatever role I can play to help this team be better than what it was, that\u2019s what I\u2019m here to do.\u201d In addition to Sintim\u2019s playing experience and knowledge of the game schematically, the coaching staff raves about Sintim\u2019s love for his alma mater. A Virginia native, Sintim knows the area and is passionate about the Wahoos. So\u2019oto excelled during his coaching tenure at UVa and was well-respected by his coaching peers. He left Charlottesville partially because he\u2019s from the West Coast and wanted to return. Sintim\u2019s heart lies in Charlottesville. \u201cHe\u2019s passionate about Virginia, and I don\u2019t think you can undersell that,\u201d co-defensive coordinator Nick Howell said in April. \u201cAny time somebody has care in their heart for something, they\u2019re gonna do a really good job at it. He\u2019s extremely passionate to be here, so it\u2019s exciting.\u201d That passion is evident to the players, who started camp Monday. Through recent practices and Zoom interactions, they like what they\u2019ve seen from their new coach. \u201cCoach Sintim wasted no time in making sure that we had a foundation of trust and understanding with each other,\u201d sophomore defensive lineman Jowon Briggs said. \u201cHe\u2019s very knowledgeable about the game. Obviously we all know about his career here and his career in the league, so it\u2019s really easy to find myself being a sponge and absorbing all the information he can have for us.\u201d Sixth-year defensive lineman Richard Burney likes that Sintim understands UVa. Despite being a little more than a decade removed from his college playing days, Sintim can relate to what the current players are going through as a UVa student-athlete. \u201cI do respect the fact that he was a UVa graduate, played at UVa,\u201d Burney said. \u201cHe has a lot of insight, a lot of knowledge about the school and just football in general. I respect him, he\u2019s a good guy, a great mentor, and overall, I think a great coach.\u201d It\u2019s unclear if Sintim\u2019s group will take the field for games this fall due to COVID-19, and his first season as UVa\u2019s defensive line coach is certainly unprecedented, but he\u2019s looking forward to whatever work he puts in this fall. A few years ago, he made it a goal to return to UVa as a coach. He made it back to Charlottesville, and he\u2019s thrilled to be back. \u201cI\u2019m living my dream right now,\u201d Sintim said.","489":"Virginia soccer players still don\u2019t know their fall schedules. Student-athletes know ACC Olympic sport competition can begin on Sept. 10, but ACC programs have yet to share official schedules. It\u2019s no secret that the fate of the fall athletic season remains uncertain. Even in mid-August, the next steps appear unclear. What is clear for Virginia\u2019s soccer programs is that athletes and coaches are on Grounds, preparing for a possible fall season. The lack of certainty and delayed start to the season bring one unexpected benefit to soccer teams, though. The month-long gap before the start of games allows for a summer acclimation period that typically escapes college soccer programs. \u201cI\u2019ve always thought our preseason was way too short,\u201d Virginia men\u2019s soccer head coach Georgia Gelnovatch said. \u201cTwo weeks is ridiculous.\u201d In previous seasons, both the men\u2019s and women\u2019s soccer programs are thrust into action shortly after officially arriving on Grounds. The women\u2019s soccer team played an exhibition on Aug. 15 in 2019 and the first game took place on Aug. 23. The men\u2019s soccer team played a preseason match on Aug. 17 last year before its season opened on Aug. 30. \u201cIt used to be we\u2019d only have two weeks and then we\u2019re off and running, we\u2019ve got games, and so now we\u2019ve got a little more time,\u201d UVa women\u2019s soccer head coach Swanson said. \u201cIt looks like we don\u2019t play until Sept. 10. We\u2019re just trying to manage that in the best way we can.\u201d With additional time to prepare for a fall season, both squads can gradually ramp up fitness levels. The preparation doesn\u2019t necessarily change within either program, but there\u2019s more time to evaluate talent and implement systems. Instead of stacking multiple practices into one day, teams can spread out work, allowing for increased recovery time if needed. \u201cMaybe in the past we might have gone double days, like two sessions a day,\u201d Swanson said. \u201cWe\u2019re just trying to be smart with where they are and knowing that we\u2019ve got a prolonged preseason to ease them back.\u201d Both the men\u2019s and women\u2019s soccer programs reached the No. 1 spot in national polls a season ago, with the women\u2019s team bowing out in the second round of the NCAA Tournament. The men\u2019s squad fell in the national championship match. Despite short preseasons in the past, UVa\u2019s soccer programs typically find themselves among the elite Division I programs. Additional preseason time gives the accomplished coaches even more time to determine their starting lineups, while working underclassmen into the squad. Slowly improving for the next month is the focus of both coaches, who also monitor the latest news with regards to the likelihood of the season. They know the fall season can be canceled at any moment. \u201cAs we\u2019ve been so close to getting started and things are changing by the minute, by the day, it can become frustrating,\u201d Gelnovatch said. \u201cFor me, just trying to compartmentalize that, stay focused, stay steady, but it\u2019s a challenge. It\u2019s not easy.\u201d In terms of protections from COVID-19, the coaches feel confident in their health protocols. Swanson says aside from additional distancing and wearing masks, it\u2019s \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d when on the soccer fields. He mentioned the mental health benefits of competing together as team, and he likes the way the players approach the unprecedented and challenging situation. The fall schedule is fluid, but the team plans on enjoying its longer preseason together. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly not the typical preseason, that\u2019s for sure, but as I told the players, we all have an opportunity here,\u201d Swanson said. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly not what we want it to be, but we\u2019ve got to make it the best it can be.\u201d An uncertain fall season adds stress to the everyday life of a student-athlete, but COVID-19 delaying the start of the soccer season provides an unusual silver lining. Practicing in masks and being tested for COVID-19 on a regular basis makes for a strange preseason, but the pressure of preparing for a season in a two-week span is removed. If nothing else, the Virginia soccer programs enjoy having what feels like an actual preseason. \u201cI\u2019ve talked about it for years,\u201d Gelnovatch said. \u201cI would gladly push our start date back. I\u2019d eliminate a game or two. I think having a proper four or five weeks of preseason, I\u2019d vote for that every day.\u201d","490":"The 2020 Virginia football season was originally scheduled to open in Atlanta with a showdown against Georgia on Labor Day. COVID-19 caused the ACC to alter its schedule, and a revised schedule revealed that VMI would visit Charlottesville on Sept. 11 to open the Cavaliers\u2019 schedule. On Thursday, VMI announced it would follow the Southern Conference\u2019s decision to postpone fall sports, leaving Virginia without a season-opening opponent. The Cavaliers\u2019 official football Twitter account announced the program would seek a schedule replacement for the Friday night season opener. Finding a replacement presents a challenge, given the volume of programs to postpone fall football. Given the ACC\u2019s revised COVID-19 rules, nonconference games must be played in the ACC team\u2019s home state. The game with VMI was scheduled to take place in Charlottesville. With many FCS programs \u2013 especially local FCS programs \u2013 officially ruled out of competing this fall it likely leaves the Cavaliers looking for an FBS replacement. Unfortunately for the Cavaliers, multiple Power 5 leagues, including the Big Ten and Pac-12, won\u2019t play this fall due to COVID-19. The group of potential replacement opponents is shrinking daily. Limited options remain for the Wahoos to schedule a nonconference foe. FBS independents like Liberty, BYU and Army are possible replacement options. UVa may have to be creative in finding a new team to open its season. The Cavaliers will look to find a program that can meet the ACC\u2019s testing standards and health protocols, as playing an opponent safely in Week 1 remains a goal. If the ACC\u2019s testing standards become more stringent in upcoming weeks it could also factor into finding the new nonconference foe. Bronco Mendenhall\u2019s program finds itself preparing for the 2020 fall season, and it doesn\u2019t know its first opponent.","491":"While the College Football Playoff might still be alive for this fall, Virginia\u2019s fall Olympic sport programs won\u2019t compete in NCAA-sponsored championships until the spring. With several Division I conferences opting against fall athletic competition, the NCAA announced Thursday that it will not have fall championships. \u201cSadly, tragically, that\u2019s gonna be the case this fall, full stop,\u201d NCAA President Mark Emmert said in a video interview posted to the organization\u2019s social media channels, \u201cbut that doesn\u2019t mean that we shouldn\u2019t and can\u2019t turn toward winter and spring and say, \u2018How can we create a legitimate championship for all those students?\u2019\u201d Emmert suggests fall sports compete for NCAA-sanctioned Division I championships in the spring. He emphasized the importance of giving priority to winter and spring sports, which already lost championships this year due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but he believes a possibility to play fall sports in the spring exists. This mean\u2019s Virginia\u2019s fall Olympic sport programs could potentially compete for championships in the spring. The ACC, however, keeps pushing forward in hopes of hosting a fall sports season. The College Football Playoff isn\u2019t run by the NCAA, keeping the potential for the event alive despite two Power 5 conferences opting against fall football. It wasn\u2019t immediately clear exactly what that means for the ACC and Olympic sports in the fall, however. UVa and other ACC programs can compete in the fall without the prospects of a national championship. Those programs can also elect to attempt to play seasons in the spring instead of the fall, but it is unlikely Power 5 programs move forward with only football this fall. If UVa and the ACC eventually move fall sports seasons to the spring, Emmert and the NCAA believe there\u2019s a realistic chance to hold championships safely. He even mentioned that he\u2019s in support of single-site \u201cbubble\u201d models, if those are needed to safely complete seasons and postseason tournaments. As the NCAA moves its focus toward the spring, numerous options remain to hold championships safely. \u201cThere\u2019s a way to do it,\u201d Emmert said. \u201cWill it be normal? Of course not, you\u2019ll be playing a fall sport in the spring. Will it create other conflicts and challenges? Of course. But is it doable? Yeah.\u201d","492":"Wearing a visor comes naturally to Ra\u2019Shaun Henry. Wearing a splash shield over his mouth in addition to his visor, well, that\u2019s about as unnatural as it gets. Henry, a new addition to the Virginia football program via the transfer portal, joins his new teammates in wearing visors and protective splash shields on their helmets during fall camp. The new helmet model represents one of many precautions aimed at reducing the potential spread of COVID-19. \u201cI love a visor,\u201d Henry, who played at St. Francis previously, said Friday. \u201cThe face shield, the bottom part, I\u2019m not used to that, so breathing, it\u2019s very hard.\u201d Fall camp offers a stiff test of physical ability, making it easy for helmets to fog up as players push their cardiovascular fitness. Like driving a car with a fogged up windshield, it\u2019s a bit more challenging to perform as a wide receiver with lessened vision. Wide receivers rely on their eyes about as much as any player on the field. While offensive linemen need to see, colliding with a defensive lineman requires far less visual clarity than a wide receiver bringing down a pass rifled into a tight throwing window. Asked how he handles the added fog in his helmet, Henry raised a towel he wears on his waist and smiled. At least Henry enjoys the visor. Terrell Jana, the team\u2019s leading returning wide receiver, never enjoyed playing in a visor and typically opted against it. He\u2019s more than willing to make the sacrifice in the name of team health this season, though, and despite a general disdain toward visors, Jana says the adjustment period is wearing off. \u201cI\u2019ve never worn a visor,\u201d Jana said. \u201cI don\u2019t like visors, so it took some getting used to. It\u2019s fine now. I mean, it fogs up a little bit every now and then, but we\u2019re used to it now.\u201d Virginia wide receivers coach Marques Hagans echoes Jana\u2019s thoughts. He heard his fair share of grumbles early in the week at the beginning of camp, but after a few practices in the books, his position group seems adjusted to the change. \u201cI think that some of the players, initially the first couple of days, found it difficult to adjust, but I think now we\u2019re starting to settle in,\u201d Hagans said. \u201cI don\u2019t think we hear as many complaints as we did before on the first initial days of putting the helmets on.\u201d The face shields represent one of the many changes made in hopes of playing a fall season safely. With the Big Ten and Pac-12 postponing fall football, the ACC, Big 12 and SEC seasons teeter on the brink of potential postponement. With two Power 5 leagues removed from fall competition, every safety decision made by the programs in the three other major Division I conferences are viewed with intense scrutiny. For a fall season to happen safely, ACC programs like UVa need to do everything right. After a few days implementing the face shield measure, the Cavaliers feel confident in navigating practices and potential games with players wearing the specialty helmets. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019ll be much of a factor,\u201d Hagans said. \u201cIt\u2019s easy for me to say because I\u2019m not the one wearing the helmets, but as far as feedback from the players I haven\u2019t heard many complaints, especially from our group, about the mask giving them problems.\u201d Perspective helps Jana adjust to the change. While in an ideal world he\u2019d play without a visor or shield, he\u2019s watched Virginia win the ACC Coastal after barely making a bowl game his freshman season. He\u2019s accustomed to hard work leading to results. \u201cA big thing in our culture here is hard things together,\u201d Jana said. \u201cI\u2019ve done harder things than wear a mask at practice at this school.\u201d","493":"Growing up in Central Virginia, Jack Culbreath and Garrett Pitts spent plenty of fall afternoons watching football games at Scott Stadium. Both players, who are now at VMI, were preparing to return home to play Virginia in the Keydets\u2019 season opener on Sept. 11. Those plans were nixed Thursday, when athletic director Dave Diles and football coach Scott Wachenheim announced that VMI\u2019s fall football season was cancelled. \u201cWe were all really bummed out,\u201d Culbreath said. \u201cWe felt that everything we had worked for had gone to waste. Coach Wach saw our emotions and really helped everybody see a new light. He told us to look at this as an extended preseason and that we are still \u201910 toes down to win the Southern Conference this spring.\u2019\u201d Culbreath, who was a special teams standout at Monticello High School, entered VMI\u2019s fall camp competing for playing time as a placekicker, punter and kickoff specialist. \u201cWe have some really experienced guys that I\u2019m going up against and so far, I\u2019ve really enjoyed competing and learning from them,\u201d Culbreath said. Pitts, who was a two-way standout at Orange County High School, wasn\u2019t expected to see much playing time this year, but he was excited to get acclimated to the college game. \u201cMan, it just hurt,\u201d Pitts said. \u201cI had just started getting into a groove and now we have to stop. Now I\u2019m learning how to push through adversity.\u201d The Keydets were a week into fall practice and the two freshman were excited with the progress that had been made not only by them, but the team. \u201cThe first week was a lot of fun,\u201d Culbreath said. \u201cI really had a great time meeting all the guys on the team. The biggest adjustment I\u2019ve had to face is the pace. The pace of the game is just so much faster than what I have been used to.\u201d Like other sports, Culbreath said returning to action during the COVID-19 pandemic has not been easy. \u201cThe biggest adjustment I have faced was probably having to follow all of the certain rules that came with this pandemic,\u201d Culbreath said. \u201cIt took a lot of getting used to.\u201d Culbreath and Pitts admitted that there was something special about beginning their college careers in their hometown. \u201cI was really looking forward to coming back home and playing in front of so many friends and family,\u201d Culbreath said. \u201cTo play in Scott Stadium would have been a dream come true. I grew up in that stadium, going to home games with family and friends every Saturday. Just being back in the stadium I grew up in would have been so exciting. If the ACC decides to play in the spring, there\u2019s a good possibility that we would still play in Charlottesville.\u201d Pitts agreed, but also is ready to move on. \u201cI was looking forward to playing at UVa the first game,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I have to control what I can control and I can get better for when we have our season in the spring.\u201d","494":"Three-plus weeks remain before the ACC\u2019s 68th, and most bizarre, football season is scheduled to begin. At any one of those approximately 35,000 minutes, the entire house of cards could collapse. Today, tomorrow, an hour before Miami and Alabama-Birmingham are set to kick off Sept. 10: Anything is possible with COVID-19 and its aftershocks. The issue now is the untold hurdles still confronting the ACC and five other Football Bowl Subdivision conferences aiming to play fall sports. Here are a handful. Transparency Four FBS leagues \u2014 the Mid-American, Mountain West, Big Ten and Pac-12 \u2014 have shuttered fall sports, and the Pac-12 explained its reasoning with a coherent, 12-page report from its medical advisors. This was in stark contrast to the Big Ten, where ineffective messaging has fueled open revolt and scarred the conference. The ACC, Big 12, SEC, American Athletic, Sun Belt and Conference USA owe their athletes, coaches, staff members and fans clarity, regardless of their ultimate decisions. Often rivals, but partners in this quest, the ACC and SEC are on the transparency course. Last week, the chairman of the ACC\u2019s medical advisory group spoke to the Sports Business Daily, and a member of the SEC\u2019s panel answered questions from The Athletic. Previously, the team doctors from Virginia and Virginia Tech, John MacKnight and Mark Rogers, outlined the challenges of staging sports during a pandemic. \u201cWe believe we can mitigate [the virus] down to a level that makes everyone safe,\u201d Cameron Wolfe, an infectious disease expert at Duke, told the Daily. \u201cCan we safely have two teams meet on the field? I would say yes. Will it be tough? Yes. Will it be expensive and hard and lots of work? For sure. But I do believe you can sufficiently mitigate the risk of bringing COVID onto the football field or into the training room at a level that\u2019s no different than living as a student on campus.\u201d Another infectious disease specialist, LSU\u2019s Catherine O\u2019Neal, told The Athletic that SEC team doctors are prepared to effectively treat any cases of myocarditis, a heart inflammation associated with COVID-19. The Pac-12\u2019s primary anxieties were test supplies and processing, infection rates in Pac-12 communities and the virus\u2019 potential short- and long-term effects. Any conference or independent university moving forward should have its medical teams address those concerns specifically and publicly. Testing Issued July 29, the ACC\u2019s in-season testing minimum for football is weekly. That\u2019s unlikely to be enough. John Wildhack, the athletic director at conference member Syracuse, announced Friday that the Orange will test three times per week during the season. The Big 12 has adopted the same frequency, and the SEC plans to test at least twice weekly, while aiming for a third. Will the ACC adjust accordingly? Will each of its 15 schools have access to enough tests? Will labs be able to process them quickly enough? Students returning College students revel in socializing, and the repopulation of campuses may be the most problematic challenge ahead. North Carolina reported COVID-19 clusters of five or more cases in four residence areas last weekend, including a fraternity house. ACC colleague Notre Dame on Friday attributed an infection spike to an off-campus party where masking and social distancing guidelines were ignored by some. In the Big 12, every resident of an Oklahoma State sorority house is quarantined after 23 people tested positive. What happens when athletes start mingling with the general student body? The NBA and NHL have shown that a bubble can work. College is not a bubble. Finalizing schedules The ACC\u2019s intent was for each of its 15 teams to play one non-conference game, at home. But subsequent decisions by other leagues and schools to pass on fall competition have left seven ACC programs, including UVa, without a nonconference date. How determined are ACC officials to find new opponents? How much more television revenue might those games represent? Are ACC schools confident each nonconference opponent will conform to the ACC\u2019s COVID-19 protocols? The conformity question became central Friday when Liberty coach Hugh Freeze told the Lynchburg News & Advance that screenings of his players the previous two weeks hadn\u2019t necessitated tests because no one showed symptoms. Never mind that people who are asymptomatic can have and spread the virus. The Flames are scheduled to play the ACC\u2019s Virginia Tech, Syracuse and N.C. State, and Syracuse\u2019s Wildhack told ESPN on Saturday that Liberty\u2019s testing approach is \u201cinadequate\u201d and \u201cdeeply troubling.\u201d","495":"Tuesday marks three weeks until the start of undergraduate in-person classes at the University of Virginia. While the semester still begins on Aug. 25, earlier this month the university delayed undergraduate classes on Grounds for two weeks due to COVID-19. The decision impacts Virginia\u2019s athletic program, which has created a bubble-like situation for student-athletes in Charlottesville. Keeping that bubble firm with thousands of students in town creates a nearly impossible task. Preparations for fall seasons are underway for numerous programs, including the football team. The groups working toward competition follow several safety guidelines to limit exposure to the coronavirus. Those precautions have worked well, especially with student-athletes remaining in their own areas without in-person instruction forcing them into contact with other students. To this point, testing results inspire optimism. It\u2019s been three weeks since the athletic department has shared a new positive COVID-19 test result. \u201cOur numbers currently indicate that our UVa football program is one of the safest places on the planet,\u201d head coach Bronco Mendenhall said earlier this month. Mendenhall quickly added a qualifier to his statement, noting the bubble\u2019s potential to pop. \u201cHowever that\u2019s prior to other students arriving and our players moving out \u2014 we\u2019re all in the same dorm right now, and moving out of the dorm and into their other housing, intermingling and being more outside of our bubble,\u201d Mendenhall said. Once students arrive in Charlottesville, the possibility of maintaining a safe bubble becomes significantly more challenging. Student-athletes will be asked to attend in-person classes, putting them in close proximity to players outside the athletic bubble. It\u2019s impossible to monitor the behavior and possible COVID-19 exposure of every student on Grounds. North Carolina, an ACC school, announced a fourth cluster of COVID-19 cases Sunday. Clusters refer to five more cases in one residential hall or dwelling. On Monday, the school announced that all undergraduate instruction will shift to remote learning start on Wednesday. Notre Dame, another university competing in ACC sports this fall, saw a recent spike in cases after students returned to campus. Many of the recent positive cases were linked to an off-campus party, according to a report in the South Bend Tribune. Keeping case numbers low when students return to the area offers a much different test than when athletes remain in their own bubble. \u201cOnce students arrive and our players are asked to go outside the bubble to class, outside the bubble for residence, it becomes an entirely different management issue which the world and the nation hasn\u2019t solved,\u201d Mendenhall said. \u201cSo, everyone has said health and safety first and foremost. I\u2019m exactly there and so I think we\u2019ve done a great job with our program in this virtual bubble for this time being. That does not mean it\u2019s sustainable or lasting or anyone else has a handle on it to this point. And so I think there\u2019s still a lot of work that needs to be done.\u201d Wide receivers coach Marques Hagans shared similar thoughts late last week when addressing the media via Zoom. He knows the program can\u2019t control everyone\u2019s behavior, but the focus of the coaches lies on providing as much relevant information as possible to student-athletes about staying safe within the bubble. \u201cAll we can do is educate our players to the highest level with the information that we have and just encourage them that if they really want to play they have to do their part when they\u2019re not around the McCue Center,\u201d Hagans said. \u201cHopefully that gives us the best chance to get to the first game and play throughout the season.\u201d Hagans says students returning to Grounds make him a little nervous about the safety of the athletic bubble. Based on current plans, students will return to Grounds prior to the start of Virginia\u2019s football season, which is set to begin on Sept. 11. A positive case of COVID-19 brings concern about the health of the infected individual. Additionally, from an athletic standpoint, positive cases and close contacts to positive cases can drastically alter the course of the fall season. Given the current need for close contacts to self-isolate for two weeks, an outbreak within an athletic team could sideline the entire team or a chunk of the team for multiple weeks. The ACC football schedule has two built-in bye weeks, but it\u2019s unclear how the conference would handle potential postponements across the league. While other ACC football programs work through life with students returning to campus, the Wahoos haven\u2019t reached that point yet. Undergraduate in-person classes don\u2019t begin for three weeks, and the university hopes undergraduates wait to return to Charlottesville until it is necessary. When students do return, UVa hopes it avoids potential COVID-19 outbreaks within the student body, but asking college students to remain socially distanced at all times is proving difficult at other ACC universities. \u201cThe reality of it is we\u2019re still college kids that have been in quarantine for months on end, and so when students get back there will be that increased temptation to kind of burst the bubble and it will be tougher,\u201d senior linebacker Charles Snowden said. Snowden acknowledges the challenge facing UVa\u2019s student-athletes in coming weeks. He also hopes his team can block out the distraction of other students to follow all health protocols needed to keep the football season alive. \u201cIt\u2019ll be tough for all of us, but I think we\u2019ve got to give it a shot and I believe in us,\u201d Snowden said.","496":"Virginia\u2019s task unit leaders gathered together, deciding which Wahoo deserved the first jersey number selection for the 2020 season. The group landed on sixth-year defensive end Richard Burney. While he pushed back, the leaders wouldn\u2019t budge. Burney picked No. 16. In a program that requires opportunities and accolades to be earned rather than given, the Cavaliers feel Burney earned the top choice through years of consistent hard work and selflessness. \u201cBurney\u2019s sixth-year, but I mean he still shows up every day, embracing the young guys.\u201d senior linebacker Charles Snowden said. \u201cThis is not an easy program, and he still comes every day with his hard hat, ready to work.\u201d Burney, who started his career as a tight end, has earned playing time on offense, defense and special teams while at UVa. He\u2019s caught a touchdown pass, sacked an opposing quarterback and snapped for punts. He\u2019s worked through blood clots that forced him to miss the majority of the 2018 season and made at least one appearance in each of the past five seasons. He\u2019s been around town longer than Bronco Mendenhall. Burney saw the Cavaliers limp to a 2-10 record in Mendenhall\u2019s first season before taking down Virginia Tech and reaching the Orange Bowl in 2019. After working his way through the program, Burney wants to step outside his comfort zone this fall. In addition to playing meaningful snaps, he wants to step up as a leader on a defense filled with personality and on-field production. \u201cI think Burney as of late has been really intentional about trying to be a leader and trying to lead by example,\u201d defensive line coach Clint Sintim said. \u201cBurney just like everyone else in the group needs to continue to improve, but I\u2019m pleased with what I\u2019ve seen thus far.\u201d In conversations with Snowden, Burney talked about wanting to be more of a vocal leader, too. The role of vocal leader doesn\u2019t always come easily to the defensive end, but he\u2019s been leading by example for years. In private, more individual settings, Burney\u2019s leadership shines. He hosted sophomore defensive tackle Jowon Briggs for Briggs\u2019 official visit during the recruiting process, and he\u2019s kept a close watch on Briggs ever since. \u201cEarly on, I got to know him and he\u2019s kind of been like that older brother type, always motivating me, making sure I know what I\u2019m doing,\u201d Briggs said. \u201cHe\u2019s definitely been watching over me, and I\u2019m very grateful for that.\u201d Unfortunately for Burney, uncertainty surrounds his sixth year. With COVID-19 posing a threat to the community and in turn the college football season, it\u2019s unclear if he\u2019ll lead the Cavaliers\u2019 formidable defense onto the field this fall. Regardless, Virginia remains in fall camp. Preparing for games in September remains a goal until players learn otherwise. Burney and company don\u2019t know what tomorrow, next week or next month might hold, but they know they\u2019re going to embrace every moment together throughout camp. He doesn\u2019t want to focus on the what-ifs, but rather the positives of competing as a unit. As he embarks on year No. 6 in the program, Burney is ready to lead. \u201cYeah, it\u2019s hard, but at the same time we\u2019re with each other,\u201d Burney said. \u201cBeing with each other, it\u2019s fun. We\u2019re out there practicing. It\u2019s hard. It\u2019s hot. It\u2019s hard to breathe but at the end of the day we\u2019re with each other and we\u2019re getting better.\u201d","497":"The Virginia men\u2019s soccer team came within a handful of plays of winning the 2019 national championship. George Gelnovatch\u2019s squad reached the national title match, falling to Georgetown in a dramatic penalty kick shootout. One of the top teams all season, the Cavaliers believed they could win the title. Unfortunately for the Wahoos, they came up just short. Despite losing several key contributors from the 2019 squad, UVa\u2019s athletes want to return to the championship match, and they believe it\u2019s possible. \u201cI honestly think that puts a fire in your belly,\u201d goalkeeper Colin Shutler said of the loss. \u201cRight after the game, obviously, I was down for maybe a day, a week, a month, who knows, but I was just gunning to be right back on the field, and I bet a lot of the guys who were right alongside me wanted that as well.\u201d Shutler and the Cavaliers will use the close call in the championship as motivation heading into the fall. Unfortunately, the fall won\u2019t include an NCAA-sanctioned national championship, however, given the amount of teams not playing due to COVID-19. The NCAA made the official announcement last Thursday. It will be an uncertain fall for the Cavaliers. The ACC has yet to release a schedule for Olympic sport programs. COVID-19 poses a serious threat to the fall season, and there\u2019s a chance the Cavaliers\u2019 ACC title defense comes in the spring. The league shared a few weeks ago that it planned on crafting conference schedules that meet the NCAA criteria for the minimum amount of games, which would mean six ACC contests for the men\u2019s soccer teams. It\u2019s unclear if that goal remains after the loss of NCAA-sponsored championships. Gelnovatch, who spoke with The Daily Progress prior to the NCAA canceling fall sports championships, said he\u2019d like another few games to consider the season a full one. He also admitted that he\u2019ll take some games over none. \u201cI do think once you get below 10 games or once you get below nine games, it gets a little funny,\u201d Gelnovatch said. \u201cI would say a minimum of like nine, but if you\u2019re asking me, you know, would I take four over nothing? Of course.\u201d The fall remains unclear for a team wanting to contend for championships. Meeting the goal of double-digit games could mean a spring season waits. Last season\u2019s results Virginia finished the 2019-20 season with a 21-2-1 overall record, including a 6-1-1 mark in ACC matches. The Cavaliers were dominant at home, winning 15 of their 16 matches. Pittsburgh was the only team able to beat UVa during the regular season. The match remained Virginia\u2019s only loss prior to the national championship. UVa came up one win short of the ultimate prize, but it\u2019s hard to view the 2019-20 season as anything other than a major success. Notable departures Four underclassmen turned professional, leaving the Cavaliers with a few major holes. Joe Bell excelled at midfield, while Daryl Dike and Daniel Steedman were quality forwards. Henry Kessler was an excellent defender who sees consistent action for the New England Revolution. All four players were among the ACC\u2019s elite. Another notable departure is Robin Afamefuna, a senior from Germany who played defense and midfield. While not always the center of attention, Afamefuna performed consistently for the Cavaliers and frequently set the tone for matches with his toughness. Virginia loses a lot. Notable returners Shutler brings tremendous experience at goalkeeper, and he\u2019ll be one of the team\u2019s stars. He\u2019s also excited to grow more as a team leader with several standouts moving on to new endeavors. \u201cI would definitely say that I want to consider myself one of the guys taking the leadership role,\u201d Shutler said. In 2020, leadership looks unusual. \u201cWith the guys in dorms, just like keeping everybody in mask wearing, stuff like that,\u201d Shutler said of leadership duties this fall. Other notable returners include Nathaniel Crofts, Irakoze Donasiyano, Bret Halsey, Philip Horton, Axel Gunnarsson, Spencer Patton and Andreas Ueland. Other players, including Cabrel Happi Kamseu, may also see increased roles. Crofts likes the balance on the roster, which relied on defense and possession a season ago to dominate opponents. The Cavaliers frequently secured early goals before easing back and maintaining possession for much of the match. \u201cLast year was heavily defensive and then sometimes attacking as well, but this year coming out I believe that we\u2019ll be a well-balanced team,\u201d Crofts said. UVa\u2019s 2020 roster returns plenty of talent, even if several players turned professional. Notable additions The Cavaliers added a large incoming class, bringing in eight freshmen and five transfers, including a pair of graduate transfers. \u201cWe knew we were losing some leadership and experience, so we wanted to make sure we picked up some transfers,\u201d Gelnovatch said. \u201cWe did that. We actually picked up a couple of grad transfers, that\u2019s another level.\u201d Look for Louis Evans, a graduate transfer from Davidson, to compete for time. The defender is experienced, starting 26 games throughout his career. Oliver Gerbig, a transfer from Coastal Carolina, also adds experience and talent on defense. It\u2019s unclear how the newcomers will all fit in the mix, but the Cavaliers have time to figure it out. Gelnovatch wants to use this year\u2019s extended preseason to take a longer look at different players who may earn time during the regular season. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to avoid putting together what looks like we think right now might be our starting team, to keep guys maybe that aren\u2019t in that mix positive and to give them a proper chance, to be honest with you,\u201d Gelnovatch said. 2020-21 outlook Uncertainty surrounds the 2020 fall season. If the Cavaliers can compete this fall, there\u2019s optimism within the program. Even without a fall NCAA championship, UVa likes its chances to compete well against ACC foes. The current focus, in addition to staying safe, is finding ways to integrate the newcomers onto the team during a pandemic that requires physical distancing. \u201cI think it\u2019s just a challenge,\u201d Crofts said. \u201cOf course we would like to be in the same room and having a joke and having a laugh and being together, but obviously the rules don\u2019t permit that at times, so we\u2019re just trying to work around it.\u201d Whenever the Cavaliers take the field, they\u2019re hopeful to have built up the chemistry necessary to contend for championships once again.","498":"It\u2019s been just over a week since the NCAA postponed fall sports championships. While the College Football Playoff may still happen in the fall season because it\u2019s not sponsored by the NCAA, Olympic Sport programs saw their fall championships moved. Even ACC Olympic sport programs currently marching toward a fall season face tremendous uncertainty. If a season occurs safely, the majority of Virginia\u2019s fall sports teams won\u2019t end the season in an NCAA Tournament. \u201cI would be lying if I didn\u2019t say it was difficult,\u201d UVa field hockey player Rachel Robinson said. \u201cDefinitely it was hard to hear the NCAA telling you, \u2018Hey, we\u2019re not having a championship this fall.\u2019 The team and me personally, that\u2019s what you\u2019ve been working toward, and as a fourth-year, this is your last chance of getting that national championship.\u201d UVa hopes a fall season occurs safely, giving the team a chance at an ACC title, even if they only play limited contests during the regular season. \u201cHow our team has responded has been really good,\u201d Robinson said. \u201cWe still have something to play for. We still have a season. We still have the ACC championship to play for, as of now.\u201d The focus lies on improving for the planned fall season. In the back of Robinson\u2019s mind, though, she still wants a crack at the national championship. Last season, Virginia made the NCAA semifinals for the first time since 2010. A talented group of returners makes UVa a likely national title contender entering the 2020 season. That goal, of course, requires a national championship be played. \u201cFingers crossed that we still get a chance in the spring,\u201d Robinson said. \u201cIt might look a little different, but we\u2019ll take it.\u201d Practicing together represents a silver lining for the Cavaliers. Players and coaches enjoy the in-person interaction and chances to work on a sport they love. It\u2019s been a rough few months for student-athletes, but there are moments worth cherishing, especially with several UVa athletic programs back together on Grounds. \u201cWe can\u2019t wish away the bad times because there\u2019s a lot of good times happening too, inside those bad times,\u201d Virginia head coach Michele Madison said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to look back and see that we wasted it.\u201d On the other hand, coaching during a pandemic offers a tremendous challenge. Not only does Madison want to prepare her team for potential games this fall, but she\u2019s trying to help them work through the uncertainty of the season. At the same time, the pandemic rages on across the country, making health precautions paramount, especially in a sports with close contact during games. \u201cIt\u2019s been hard,\u201d Madison said. \u201cI would be lying if I said it wasn\u2019t difficult on a day-to-day basis, carrying the emotional toll of a lot of young people who are extremely disappointed and staff members and myself included, but you still have to deal with the global pandemic.\u201d Madison says she used to live her life day-by-day. Now it feels like she\u2019s living minute-by-minute. Unfortunately, most of the news about fall sports skews negative due to COVID-19\u2019s continued spread. Several conferences postponed sports to the spring, including a pair of Power 5 leagues. Both Notre Dame and North Carolina experienced COVID-19 outbreaks on campus in recent days, causing UNC to move undergraduate classes online. Notre Dame added restrictive measures hoping two weeks under new guidelines can curtail the spread in the university community. If not, students will head home. It\u2019s been months of Zoom meetings within athletic departments, with coaches frequently telling student-athletes bad news about what\u2019s next. \u201cI don\u2019t think the feeling in my gut ever goes away,\u201d Madison said. \u201cSeeing their faces on the Zoom was just heart-wrenching.\u201d With a season possibly starting in mid-September for the UVa field hockey team, uncertainty remains. The program knows it won\u2019t compete for a national title in the fall, and it still doesn\u2019t have a fall schedule. As of mid-August, the team still has questions. \u201cThey just want answers,\u201d Madison said. \u201cI keep trying to tell everyone that they\u2019re waiting so that they don\u2019t have to say no.\u201d","499":"Bronco Mendenhall joined a media Zoom call Friday at approximately 10:30 a.m. By 11 a.m., Virginia football fans had learned that the Cavaliers\u2019 offense will be without three important skill players for the immediate future. First, Mendenhall revealed that Indiana transfer running back Ronnie Walker Jr. received word on his waiver to play immediately. The NCAA denied the request. UVa appealed, and it hopes to learn the result of the appeal soon. \u201cNo. 1, I\u2019m not sure how the waivers are even considered and not sure why it was denied,\u201d Mendenhall said. \u201cDon\u2019t agree with it, and hopefully the appeal will work in his favor and in our favor, which would be fair.\u201d Walker Jr. played two seasons at Indiana before transferring to UVa this offseason. He has two years of eligibility remaining, whenever he\u2019s allowed to take the field. A Virginia native, Walker Jr. transferred to UVa in part to be closer to home. When Walker announced his decision, he shared that he wanted to be closer to home to help his mom when needed, while also giving her the opportunity to see him play. UVa still hopes that Walker Jr. will receive the waiver following the appeal. Seconds after discussing Walker Jr.\u2019s failed waiver application, Mendenhall revealed that wide receiver Dontayvion Wicks will miss the 2020 season. \u201cWe have had a loss,\u201d Mendenhall said. \u201cWe\u2019ve lost Dontayvion Wicks for the season. An injury happened last week.\u201d The loss of Wicks, a sophomore wide receiver with good size and strength, limits options at outside receiver. Tavares Kelly Jr. and Billy Kemp IV are both built like slot receivers, whereas Wicks made sense lining up on the outside. Fortunately for the Cavaliers, FCS transfer Ra\u2019Shaun Henry joined the program. Mendenhall called the wide receiver from St. Francis a \u201cbright spot.\u201d Henry possesses the size needed to perform outside. UVa\u2019s head coach admitted there\u2019s some concern with depth at the position, but Terrell Jana and Henry make for two quality options outside. Mendenhall also likes what he\u2019s seen from his two freshmen wide receivers, Lavel Davis Jr. and Demick Starling. Davis Jr. may be the most fascinating receiver on the roster. At 6-foot-7, his size jumps off the page. He caught 22 touchdown passes during his final two years of high school, while also competing in track and basketball. The three-star recruit came to Charlottesville ahead of where Mendenhall expected. The coach says he might player earlier than originally planned. \u201cSome volatility there, but man, our recruiting, especially our two first years and our grad transfer Ra\u2019Shaun Henry, that\u2019s been a lifesaver \u2014 those three \u2014 for that position,\u201d Mendenhall said. Later in the media availability, Mendenhall circled back to the running back position, revealing yet another blow to the offense. Mike Hollins, a sophomore running back adored by the coaching staff, is one of the team\u2019s five players who opted out and aren\u2019t currently with the program. It\u2019s unclear if Hollins opted out because of COVID-19 or other reasons. Without Hollins, Walker Jr.\u2019s waiver appeal becomes even more important. Wayne Taulapapa returns at the position, but outside of him, the Cavaliers lack depth. Shane Simpson, a transfer from Towson, may immediately step into a prominent role with Taulapapa. Simpson enters the mix with more speed but less strength than Taulapapa. Simpson is no slouch in the weight room, but he\u2019s a more elusive and dynamic runner than Taulapapa, which could make for a solid 1-2 punch at running back. An injury or COVID-19 positive test or contact tracing result could quickly jeopardize that 1-2 punch, though. With COVID-19 a factor this fall and injuries at running back always a possibility, depth becomes critical. UVa\u2019s running back room doesn\u2019t have nearly the depth it expected entering the year. Depth means everything to college football teams entering an unusual fall season. Virginia likes where it stands at quarterback and offensive line. The running back and wide receiver rooms, however, firmly become the group\u2019s largest question marks following Mendenhall\u2019s Friday announcements.","500":"The Virginia athletics department shared its fifth round of COVID-19 test results Friday, with student-athletes producing no new positive test results. The Cavaliers haven\u2019t reported a positive COVID-19 test since July 24. Since the football team began voluntary workouts in Charlottesville on July 5, 282 UVa student-athletes have been screened for COVID-19. Only four student-athletes produced positive test results. None of those four student-athletes required hospitalization. \u201cWe\u2019ve had zero cases attributed to Charlottesville,\u201d head football coach Bronco Mendenhall said Friday of his team. \u201cThe only cases we had were when players brought it back with them when they arrived. It\u2019s been remarkable the discipline our team has used, not only our team, but the entire athletic department. Our numbers are staggeringly positive.\u201d Baseball and both cross country programs recently brought back student-athletes, meaning 10 athletic programs are on Grounds going through preseason training or offseason conditioning work. The other seven teams include both basketball and soccer programs as well as field hockey, football and volleyball. Since testing began on July 5, 117 of the student-athletes tested were football players. Three of the student-athletes to produce positive tests came from the football team. The other nine athletic programs have had 165 student-athletes tested, and just one student-athlete produced a positive test result. The ACC athletic schedule is expected to begin in September. Prior to competing in games, UVa\u2019s athletic programs have done well to keep COVID-19 case numbers low. Virginia begins in-person undergraduate classes on Sept. 8, which represents a two-week delay from the original start date. Other ACC programs have faced issues when resuming in-person instruction. Notre Dame., North Carolina and North Carolina State all saw clusters of COVID-19 cases pop up on campus following the widespread return of students. It\u2019s a concern for Mendenhall and UVa\u2019s athletic programs. After about seven weeks of its implementation, the athletic department bubble seems to work. In-person classes and new living situations \u2014 the football team is living in dorms currently \u2014 mean the bubble is destined to be broken, at least in some capacity. \u201cThat is what I\u2019m losing sleep over right now,\u201d Mendenhall said.","501":"Virginia\u2019s last regular-season football game came against Virginia Tech. The Cavaliers beat the Hokies 39-30 on Nov. 29, breaking a 15-year losing streak to their bitter rival. After losing to Clemson and Florida in postseason games, the Cavaliers might go for their first win since beating the Hokies against, oddly enough, the Hokies. \u201cThe latest I\u2019ve heard is it\u2019s likely we will not replace VMI,\u201d UVa head coach Bronco Mendenhall said Friday. \u201cThat\u2019s the latest I\u2019ve heard and so that then would lead to an opening game versus Virginia Tech. Again, it\u2019s not definitive yet. Latest I\u2019ve heard though is that\u2019s the direction we\u2019re headed.\u201d Georgia was originally scheduled to open Virginia\u2019s season. COVID-19 caused a change of plans. VMI became the first game on UVa\u2019s revised schedule, giving the Cavaliers a nonconference opener on Sept. 11 to go with its 10-game ACC slate. Alas, COVID-19 had other plans once again. The Southern Conference postponed fall conference competition on Aug. 13. While programs were allowed to schedule nonconference games, VMI opted against playing the Cavaliers with its SoCon schedule gone. UVa announced it would seek a replacement for the season opener shortly after VMI\u2019s decision, but Mendenhall\u2019s latest discussion with university administrators shares that the Wahoos might open against the Hokies on Sept. 19. Virginia Tech opens the week prior with a game against North Carolina State. While the Cavaliers would be more rested than the Hokies entering the matchup, opening the year against a quality rival brings a major challenge to Mendenhall\u2019s squad. If UVa doesn\u2019t add a game on Sept. 11 or Sept. 12, it means the Commonwealth Cup is on the line the first time Virginia takes the field. There wouldn\u2019t be a nonconference matchup to work through any rust or Week 1 jitters. The first start of quarterback Brennan Armstrong or Keytaon Thompson\u2019s UVa career could come against the team\u2019s most disliked opponent in a road game. Talk about pressure. Regardless of how it unfolds, Mendenhall is focused on preparing his team for whatever the fall schedule offers. \u201cLong time away from our first game still,\u201d Mendenhall said. \u201cReally today is the equivalent of maybe the start of fall camp if that\u2019s the first day, which is four more weeks. So, lots of time to manage. But with the unique structure we put in place I think we can use the time, certainly, and give our team the best chance to be prepared but also safe, so that\u2019ll be my focus, if indeed we don\u2019t find a replacement.\u201d UVa played 184 total games between its 2003 and 2019 victories over Virginia Tech. If the Cavaliers can take down the Hokies in 2020, they might go just two games between wins over their rival. After 15 long seasons without beating Virginia Tech, UVa could have a chance to beat the Hokies twice in the span of four games.","502":"An uncertain fall season has generated stress among student-athletes. For every fall sport other than FBS football, the possibility of competing for a national championship in the fall is gone. The NCAA hopes to conduct fall championships in the spring, if it can do so safely. That added stress left some student-athletes wondering if their final seasons would end without a chance at a national championship. \u201cThe big thing that was weighing me down was, I\u2019m a fourth-year, am I going to get another year of eligibility?\u201d UVa women\u2019s soccer senior goalkeeper Laurel Ivory said. Fortunately for Ivory, the NCAA granted an additional year of eligibility to all fall sports student-athletes, regardless of how much they play this season. Ivory, for example, can play ACC games this fall, an NCAA postseason this spring and another full season next fall. If the season gets canceled in the fall, but the Wahoos play in the spring, she\u2019s still eligible for a final season in the fall of 2021. The news, which the NCAA announced Friday, looks similar to what spring sport athletes recently received. It\u2019s up to each institution how scholarships will be handled for those athletes, but returning seniors won\u2019t count toward scholarship limits. \u201cThat feels so much better, especially with me personally,\u201d Ivory said. \u201cI missed a major part of the postseason last year, and I didn\u2019t want my time here to end like that.\u201d Ivory suffered a jaw injury at the end of the 2019 ACC Tournament, costing her a chance to compete in the NCAA Tournament. After being one of the best teams in the country all season, UVa fell in the second round of the NCAA Tournament without Ivory on the field. \u201cI don\u2019t want to end on that situation,\u201d said Ivory, who had an NCAA women\u2019s soccer tournament flag in the background of her Zoom call with The Daily Progress. \u201cI want another shot at this national championship because I think we were so promising last season, and we were so close to so many of the big goals we set for ourselves and to not finish that out with the team was absolutely heartbreaking. So, to know that I can get another shot at that, it makes me really happy and just calms a lot of the anxiety and the nerves down.\u201d The NCAA\u2019s decision helps ease the mental burden on athletes dealing with the uncertain fall season caused by COVID-19. The Virginia women\u2019s soccer team, for example, still doesn\u2019t know its fall schedule. Knowing the option of returning in the fall of 2021 remains provides some level of relief. On the other hand, several of UVa\u2019s spring sport athletes opted against returning after they lost most of their 2020 season. Some, like softball pitcher Riley Wilkinson, had plans to attend medical school. Baseball\u2019s Chesdin Harrington also opted to pursue other opportunities. Given the need for student-athletes to take academic courses, graduate degree offerings can factor into decisions. Some players, like UVa women\u2019s lacrosse star Sammy Mueller, transferred to use her eligibility relief. She went to Northwestern to play her final collegiate season because the Wildcats offer an education route she wants to pursue, while UVa did not. Given the intense financial burden caused by COVID-19, athletic departments will also have to grapple with whether or not they\u2019re willing and able to cover additional scholarship costs or if students will be asked to cover those on their own. The Richmond Times-Dispatch reported in April that UVa wouldn\u2019t increase the scholarship budgets for spring sports programs bringing seniors back for an additional season. It would be up to coaches to determine funding from within their program\u2019s budget. The spring showed that eligibility relief provides some level of escape, but it\u2019s far from a perfect solution for everyone. Being able to use eligibility relief doesn\u2019t mean every athlete can or will return for the fall of 2021. \u201cNow, just who pays for it and how you manage it will be the issue,\u201d UVa head football coach Bronco Mendenhall said. \u201cI don\u2019t think there will be complete continuity across college sports in how that is handled in terms of football and maybe that is the intent.\u201d","503":"Baylor University head men\u2019s tennis coach Brian Boland\u2019s surprise resignation last month came after university officials investigated him on allegations he sent inappropriate text messages to a student who had hoped to make the Baylor women\u2019s team. Boland, who coached the Virginia men\u2019s tennis team to four outdoor national championships, was hired at Baylor before the 2018 tennis season, and his abrupt departure without an apparent new job offer left many wondering why he resigned. The Waco Tribune-Herald obtained screen shots of text messages and social media posts that appear to be from Boland to the student, who started school at Baylor in 2017 after moving from the East Coast. Boland appears to ask the student to meet him in at least two text messages that came from Boland\u2019s phone. In a subsequent Facebook message, the student tells Boland she felt disrespected and found the messages \u201cnot only inappropriate but extremely unprofessional.\u201d Boland did not respond this week to messages from the Tribune-Herald seeking comment for this story. Baylor President Linda Livingstone said, \u201cI can\u2019t speak to that. It\u2019s a personnel issue. He resigned, and we wish him all the best.\u201d Boland\u2019s associate head coach Michael Woodson was named interim men\u2019s head coach for the 2020-21 season. He deferred comment to David Kaye, Baylor associate athletics director for communications. \u201cBrian Boland is no longer employed by Baylor University,\u201d Kaye said. \u201cAs a personnel matter, we have no further comment.\u201d In one message, sent from Boland\u2019s phone at 11:03 p.m. with no date shown, Boland speaks of meeting the woman \u201ctomorrow or Friday.\u201d A former Baylor tennis player and a friend of the woman who asked not to be identified said the student had hoped Boland would intervene on her behalf with women\u2019s tennis coach Joey Scrivano to see if he would reconsider his decision to not allow her on the team. The message continues: \u201cWant to go out for some dinner and beers? I am thinking tomorrow night on me?\u201d The materials do not show a response from the student. In another series of messages that appear to be sent from Boland\u2019s phone at 3:27 a.m., Boland says, \u201cI guess I\u2019m in your doghouse. If you can find something open I will meet you now since I am wide awake. Is there a bar open? I am dead serious. Of course this is not something you share with [a friend of the student and a member of Boland\u2019s team] but since I cannot sleep I am game.\u201d After no response from the student, a message from Boland\u2019s phone says, \u201cHaha. Have you recovered yet? HaHa. Or are you seeing what is open?\u201d Again, after no response, a text from Boland\u2019s phone says, \u201cHello.\u201d Later, a message says, \u201cHaha.\u201d The student did not return phone messages this week from the Tribune-Herald. She wrote a Facebook message to Boland that starts out by saying it took her quite a while to decide if she should \u201ceven acknowledge these messages\u201d and what she would say if she did. \u201cThose messages were not only inappropriate but extremely unprofessional,\u201d she wrote to Boland on Facebook. \u201cI feel completely disrespected. I reached out to you because of our interaction in your office with [another tennis player and friend] and the impression it gave me that you were one of the good guys. \u201cI briefly shared a story with you and then opened up again when I reached out and said I wanted to join the team. You messaging me at midnight multiple times to ask me to meet you at a bar not only made me feel very uncomfortable, but showed me you really had no interest or intention of helping me or taking my request seriously. I am disappointed once again in the character and behavior of Baylor\u2019s tennis coaches,\u201d the post says. In an email to the student from Brianna Gilbreath, a case coordinator in Baylor\u2019s Title IX Office, Gilbreath said she was \u201creaching out\u201d to provide her with an update. \u201cWhile we cannot share details, we can assure that the concerns with Brian Boland have been addressed,\u201d she wrote. \u201cIf you receive any contact from him, please contact us immediately. If you need any further assistance with anything please don\u2019t hesitate to reach out.\u201d Boland announced his surprise resignation July 29. He won four national titles over a five-year span at the University of Virginia from 2013-17, and was a two-time Intercollegiate Tennis Association National Coach of the Year. In his short tenure at Baylor, he compiled a 38-9 record, going 25-6 and winning the Big 12 tournament in 2019. The team was 13-3 during the 2020 season that was abbreviated by COVID-19. \u201cI wish to thank my Baylor family, especially my dedicated and talented players, coaches and staff,\u201d Boland said in a statement announcing his resignation. \u201cWithout their effort and dedication, the success we have enjoyed over the last two years would not have been possible. I also wish to thank the Baylor administration, especially athletic director Mack Rhoades, Jeramiah Dickey and Kenny Boyd for the kindness, grace and support that each of them has shown me, my family and the Baylor tennis program. \u201cIt has been an honor and privilege to have worked with all of the great people in and around Baylor tennis. I leave this program with a sense of pride and accomplishment and look forward to what lies ahead of me both personally and professionally. I wish Michael Woodson and Baylor tennis all the best as they continue their pursuit of excellence.\u201d","504":"The University of Virginia prides itself on its academic prestige. Players and coaches within the athletic department frequently discuss academic standing. The football program, especially, highlights the student portion of being a student-athlete. Embracing academics is an admirable goal for any student-athlete, but it\u2019s easier said than done this fall. With COVID-19 still posing a public health risk, there\u2019s an argument that for a safe fall college football season to occur, undergraduate students shouldn\u2019t be allowed on campuses. It remains to be seen if college administrators will feel comfortable with that situation, though. \u201cThere is no athletic calculus to engage in if our campuses aren\u2019t reopened,\u201d Notre Dame Athletic Director Jack Swarbrick told ESPN in April. Notre Dame finds itself in quite the predicament ahead of the college football season. Swarbrick said in April that the school likely won\u2019t play sports if students can\u2019t safely be on campus. After bringing students back earlier this month, Notre Dame is struggling mightily to have an in-person semester. Off-campus gatherings led to a spike in COVID-19 cases at Notre Dame, and the college nearly sent everyone home. Instead, it moved classes online for two weeks, hoping increased restrictions for the 14 days will help curb the spread within the campus community. If that two-week time period doesn\u2019t help mitigate the spread, Notre Dame plans to move to online-only classes. Two other ACC schools \u2014 North Carolina and North Carolina State \u2014 both recently moved to online-only classes after several clusters of COVID-19 cases broke out within each campus community. Off-campus gatherings were determined as the causes of those outbreaks. \u201cBattling the spread of COVID-19 is a challenging endeavor even when everyone is practicing safety measures,\u201d N.C. State Chancellor Randy Woodson said in a statement. \u201cUnfortunately, the actions of a few are jeopardizing the health and safety of the larger community.\u201d As college administrators share shock and outrage over college students partying, the college football season creeps closer. UNC and N.C. State are moving forward with fall athletic plans despite moving classes online. Would UVa do the same if COVID-19 outbreaks begin when students start undergraduate in-person classes on Sept. 8? \u201cIt is the exact position I was visiting with our athletic director and our team leaders yesterday, and it\u2019s a really unique position,\u201d Virginia head football coach Bronco Mendenhall said Friday. \u201cI love the idea of student-athlete in that order, and it\u2019s very difficult for me to reconcile having football players on Grounds and no other students on Grounds from a philosophical perspective.\u201d On the flip side, Mendenhall often speaks his mind about the issues that come with the return of students. UVa\u2019s athletic department hasn\u2019t reported a positive COVID-19 test since July 24. The athletic bubble works well. The student-athletes across the 10 programs back on Grounds have done well to keep COVID-19 case counts low. Safety protocols at practice help reduce any potential spread of the virus within athletic competition. Outside of practice, football players live in the dorms, eat meals in their rooms and wear masks and socially distance as appropriate. Following the health protocols with regular COVID-19 testing has helped keep the Cavaliers healthy. When students come to town, the bubble is almost certain to pop. \u201cOur players are getting ready to move off Grounds and the students are coming and some of our classes will be in person, and so by that very design, the bubble is broken,\u201d Mendenhall said. \u201cAnd so that really is going back to the very core of the initial advice we all received, which is masking and social distancing and washing your hands and the discipline to do all that.\u201d From a philosophical perspective, Mendenhall believes student-athletes are students first. He also wants to coach his team, and he knows the athletic bubble can work. \u201cNow if I say and I look at my team and see how much they want to play and they want me to coach them and they want me to keep them safe and I want to keep them safe, it\u2019s really tricky,\u201d Mendenhall said, \u201cbecause philosophically and morally, I have a strong thought, and then I have these relationships with my team and they want to play and they want me to coach them and they want to be safe at the same time, and I think I can help them do that.\u201d Sending all students home while keeping student-athletes in Charlottesville hurts the amateurism model, as universities move one step closer to admitting that student-athletes aren\u2019t treated like regular students. It\u2019s also probably the best bet to play college football safely this fall, especially after the outbreaks seen at several ACC institutions once in-person classes resumed. If UVa students return on Sept. 8, it gives students a chance at an in-person fall semester. A return also places the college football season at risk. If the return of students goes poorly, like the reopening of the Notre Dame, North Carolina and North Carolina State campuses, UVa would face a difficult decision: Play football with students leaving Grounds for online classes or put an end to the 2020 fall athletic season. \u201cI\u2019m conflicted,\u201d Mendenhall said. \u201cThat\u2019s the best way I can put it.\u201d","505":"COVID-19 has affected all of us in various ways. For Covenant field hockey player Abi Shim and her family, the pandemic has hit close to home. Shim and her older sister, Lizzy, a field hockey player at Virginia, both had their respective field hockey seasons altered and were forced to take classes in a virtual environment. Abi Shim\u2019s high school field hockey season was cancelled, while Lizzy\u2019s college season remains in limbo due to the pandemic. Their father, Dr. Yun Michael Shim, has seen the impacts of COVID-19 firsthand. Dr. Shim, who is a pulmonary and critical care doctor at the University of Virginia Medical Center, has spent the past several months helping to treat coronavirus patients. \u201cAll the UVa pulmonary and critical care doctors have worked very closely with hospitalist doctors to take care of all COVID patients,\u201d Dr. Shim said. \u201cThese doctors have been working very hard, long hours. Every doctor at UVa didn\u2019t complain at all and every one of them took care of these sick patients very professionally and compassionately.\u201d Abi Shim said her father has spent countless hours at the hospital over the past several months because of the pandemic. At times, Shim said her father has quarantined himself from the rest of the family when he felt that had unusually high level of exposure to the coronavirus. \u201cIt was hard not to be worried about him, but I knew that his patients were his utmost priority and he had to dedicate himself to their care,\u201d she said. \u201cHe has been extra careful so that he doesn\u2019t bring the disease home, so many nights he has been sleeping in a different room in one side of the house to protect the family.\u201d Dr. Shim admitted the past several months haven\u2019t been easy. \u201cI\u2019m very proud of all my colleagues who have worked so hard,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that this pandemic is very unique, but it will definitely end in due time, hopefully with a good vaccine becoming available in the near future.\u201d As for Abi Shim, the virus has had a major impact on her ability to continue to improve her game. With no practices or team structure, she had to remain self-motivated. \u201cWhat I learned about myself is that I really thrive in the discipline of a team setting and experiences,\u201d Shim said. \u201cMotivating myself to get out there, day in and day out, to condition and to sharpen my skills was difficult at times.\u201d That\u2019s when her sister, Lizzy, stepped in. The junior striker for Virginia field hockey team had Abi join her for her daily workout sessions, which helped her stay active. \u201cHer level of discipline is obviously on another level being that she\u2019s a Division I athlete and she encouraged me to get out with her every day to condition and to run field hockey drills,\u201d Abi Shim said. \u201cShe forced me to run through the drills just as hard as she did and didn\u2019t allow me to slack. I got a glimpse of what a high-level training looks like through her and I am so excited at the prospect of continuing my athletic career at the next level.\u201d Although she enjoyed training with her sister, Abi Shim still longed for the interaction with her teammates. That changed last month, when Gov. Ralph Northam relaxed restrictions on athletics and allowed teams to work out in small numbers. Shim took advantage and worked out with her club team, the Richmond Panthers. Coaches Betsy Ellis and Annie Zinkavich created small group sessions of eight players to allow them to get back on the field and train. \u201cThey are strict about monitoring every and any symptoms and made us all committed to being safe in our personal lives and conduct, in order for us to have this opportunity to continue,\u201d Shim said. The Panthers have had twice-weekly sessions since early July and have even taken part in a controlled scrimmage against another club team. Shim\u2019s hope to return to action with her high school team this fall ended ended earlier this month when Covenant decided to cancel its fall sports season because of COVID-19. The Eagles had won the two conference championships and Shim and her teammates were eager to carry on that winning tradition this fall. \u201cThere are so many regrets about not being able to represent Covenant this fall,\u201d Shim said. \u201cWe won\u2019t be able to defend our conference title, which we have won two years running. Our team brought a lot of excitement to the conference and an elevated level of play. I am sad that we won\u2019t have the opportunity to be challenged and to challenge our conference again this year.\u201d Three years ago, Shim was an eighth-grader on an Eagles team that captured the VISAA Division II state title. She remembers sharing that title with her sister and the great memories that come from experiencing that journey. \u201cI am sad for our seniors that they will not have the opportunity to chase the state title,\u201d she said. \u201cWe won states three years ago and a few of us got to experience that directly and since then, we\u2019ve all been working hard and dreaming of winning it again.\u201d","506":"As the clock hit zero and Virginia beat Virginia Tech 39-30 to break a 15-game losing streak to the Hokies, UVa faithful stormed the Scott Stadium field. Emotions were high in Charlottesville as the Cavaliers finally beat their bitter rival last fall. Don\u2019t expect thousands of fans rushing the field in celebration in 2020. Both Virginia and Virginia Tech anticipate a limit of 1,000 fans per football game, according to current Virginia guidelines on large gatherings. \u201cThat would probably be just the families of our players and the families of our coaches,\u201d UVa head coach Bronco Mendenhall said. \u201cThat probably gets us to that number. And we\u2019re a family first, last, always program so that would be in alignment.\u201d Mendenhall shared Friday that it\u2019s likely UVa won\u2019t find a replacement for VMI to open the season. That could lead to an opening week game against Virginia Tech in Blacksburg. The rivalry will be renewed less than a year after the Wahoos took down the Hokies in a thrilling matchup at Scott Stadium. The heated rivalry will certainly be different in 2020. In addition to potentially opening Virginia\u2019s season, the game will be drastically altered by COVID-19. Players who test positive for the virus the week of the game will be held out, as will close contacts due to contact tracing protocols. Additionally, the usually intense rivalry will miss the thousands of screaming fans who make the rivalry so special. As the ACC football season inches closer, teams are sharing general expectations for fan attendance. It varies wildly across the conference, leaving some schools with potential home-field disadvantages. UVa\u2019s five road opponents offer an interesting blend of allowed attendances. Sept. 19 at Virginia TechIt\u2019s unclear if the Hokies will follow the Cavaliers\u2019 idea of allowing mostly family members of coaches and players in the stands, but, like UVa, Virginia Tech anticipates a seating limit of 1,000 people. Guidelines may change by mid-September, which could allow more people to attend the contest. If the guideline stays the same, the Cavaliers and Hokies will compete for the Commonwealth Cup in Lane Stadium in front of roughly 65,000 empty seats. Oct. 3 at Clemson The Clemson Insider reported this week that Clemson was looking at allowing roughly 16,000 fans at games this fall, which would be just below 25% of Memorial Stadium\u2019s capacity. While that report is not official, the ballpark number checks out. The University of South Carolina announced Thursday that it expects about 20,000 fans per game this fall. State officials approved the plans for South Carolina. With a stadium seating capacity similar to South Carolina\u2019s, the reigning ACC champions will likely receive a similar plan to their in-state rival. Expect approximately 15,000-20,000 people at Clemson games this fall. That\u2019s a dramatic decrease from a typical game, but it still offers Clemson a larger home-field advantage than UVa\u2019s attendance limit of 1,000. Oct. 17 at Wake ForestPhase II of North Carolina\u2019s reopening lasts through Sept. 11. Phase II allows spectators at sporting events. Unfortunately for fans, the spectator limit must also follow the outdoor space gathering. That\u2019s capped at 25 people. Given the Oct. 17 start date, there\u2019s a chance North Carolina loosens those restrictions prior to UVa\u2019s road contest at Wake Forest. Currently, however, the Cavaliers wouldn\u2019t face much of a road crowd when playing the Demon Deacons. Oct. 24 at Miami According to reports from local Miami news outlets, the Hurricanes are still working with Hard Rock Stadium to determine exact seating capacity limits. The stadium holds 65,326 people typically. Florida and Florida State are looking at approximately 15-25% of capacity for their home games. If Miami followed a similar path as their in-state rivals and went to 15% seating capacity, it would allow roughly 10,000 fans. With the game a few months away, the health of the Miami area and local restrictions could impact allowed crowd attendance. Nov. 28 at Florida StateFlorida State shared a couple weeks ago that home games will adhere to social distancing guidelines, which will likely limit seating capacity to 20-25% of a usual home game. Doak Campbell Stadium holds 79,560 people. The Seminoles will likely bring 15,000-20,000 people to home contests. Interestingly, the program also plans to allow tailgating for home games. FSU announced tailgating guidelines earlier this week. It\u2019s unclear if tailgating will still be allowed by the time UVa visits Tallahassee in late November. \u201cIf we as a Seminole family cannot create a tailgating environment that protects the health and safety of each other, it may be necessary to revisit this approach,\u201d FSU athletic director David Coburn said in a news release.","507":"In the 85th minute of the 2019 ACC Championship match against North Carolina, Virginia goalkeeper Laurel Ivory dove for a ball and took a knee to the face. She missed the rest of the game. It was later revealed that the collision broke Ivory\u2019s jaw. She missed the rest of the postseason, and the Virginia women\u2019s soccer team was upset in the second round of the NCAA Tournament just two matches later. Ivory, who accepts a vocal leadership role both on and off the pitch, was using a whiteboard to communicate with teammates when the Wahoos gave up a season-high three goals in a 3-2 defeat against Washington State. \u201cHaving her out for the initial part of the injury, you could tell something was missing as a player of course, but also just her personality,\u201d junior Rebecca Jarrett said. \u201cYou could tell something was off. It was a little quieter.\u201d Losing Ivory hurt the team\u2019s national title chances, and it also left Ivory with an unusual rehab process. Typically, soccer players may injure a knee or an ankle, requiring time off their feet to recover. For UVa\u2019s senior goalkeeper, recovery looked much different. \u201cI remember thinking to myself, this would be the injury I get,\u201d Ivory laughed. \u201cJust so obscure, like, are you kidding me?\u201d Instead of going through the standard physical therapy required for a traditional injury, Ivory needed surgery on her jaw and then went on an all-liquid diet for about six weeks. Impressively, she only missed about two months of time on the field with her teammates. The two months, however, were tough. Instead of facing drills or conditioning work, head coach Steve Swanson tasked Ivory with finding a way to consume enough calories to stay fit and healthy without eating solid food. \u201cSteve looked at me and he was like, \u2018Your workout now is basically eating,\u2019\u201d Ivory said. That meant working with UVa\u2019s sports nutrition staff to eat creatively for more than a month. Ivory laughed when saying she\u2019d stop by the dining hall to \u201cdrink lunch\u201d before visiting the team\u2019s practice. \u201cI lived off soup, smoothies and ice cream,\u201d Ivory said. \u201cThat got old pretty quick.\u201d Despite the challenges of eating solely liquid foods \u2014 Ivory says she can confidently say she hasn\u2019t had a lot of soup since \u2014 she credits UVa\u2019s sports nutrition department with helping her progress through the injury. They worked to concoct unique smoothies to keep her from becoming too tired of consuming all liquid foods. Whether it was a healthy smoothie or S\u2019mores creation, Ivory was well taken care of by the sports nutrition personnel. \u201cOur sports nutrition department just saved my life,\u201d Ivory said. \u201cThey put everything up for me. I definitely would not have recovered in the way that I did without them.\u201d In addition to nutrition concerns, Ivory spent a couple weeks using a whiteboard to share her thoughts with teammates because she couldn\u2019t speak due to the nature of her injury. The initial days of using the whiteboard were a challenge, especially for her teammates, but they quickly picked up on Ivory\u2019s thought process. Sophomore Diana Ordonez became adept at reading Ivory\u2019s moans, groans and whines, understanding almost everything the upperclassmen wanted. There were times, however, when nobody knew what Ivory meant and even the description on the whiteboard left them confused. Months after the injury and recovery, Ivory and her teammates laugh about the situation. \u201cAfter the first couple days, when she would start writing I\u2019m like, \u2018Oh, she\u2019s trying to say this, like, this is what she means,\u2019\u201d Jarrett said, laughing. \u201cIt\u2019s not funny, but it was kind of funny at times when no one knew what she was saying.\u201d Keeping up with the conversations via whiteboard also proved challenging for the All-ACC Third Team selection. \u201cI would start writing and then by the time I finished my two sentences the conversation had shifted,\u201d Ivory said. With the Wahoos back on Grounds preparing for a potential fall season, assuming COVID-19 allows for it, Ivory can speak again. She\u2019s back to being a vocal presence in off-field interactions and when she\u2019s on the field. Keeping up with the conversation no longer presents an issue to one of the team\u2019s most important leaders. Physically, she\u2019s been training since January and her jaw is healed. Whenever the program takes the field for games, she\u2019s ready to build on an terrific 2019. \u201cShe\u2019s doing really well,\u201d Swanson said. \u201cShe\u2019s got a great, positive outlook and physically she\u2019s in a good place. I think she\u2019s ready to resume where she left off, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d Given the uncertainty facing the fall season and the constant health concerns brought about by COVID-19, Ivory\u2019s presence \u2014 and voice \u2014 might be as important as ever. \u201cNow that she\u2019s fully back as a captain and just as a person, you can\u2019t replace her,\u201d Jarrett said. As young players try to familiarize themselves with college life, they\u2019re also tasked with staying healthy and avoiding large social gatherings typical of someone\u2019s first year in college. Instead of heading to parties and other social gatherings, underclassmen athletes will follow the university\u2019s rule of limiting social interactions to groups of 15 people or fewer. Nothing about the fall 2020 season is easy, but Ivory helps make the transition doable for the younger Wahoos. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to have a consistent voice, a consistent presence of someone that you trust and younger players can look up to and know that as a player she\u2019s gonna do her job, but also as a person she\u2019s looking out for your well being and gonna talk to you if you need it \u2014 now that she can talk \u2014 or shoot you a text or whatever,\u201d Jarrett said. \u201cIt\u2019s huge any time, but especially in a time like right now.\u201d","508":"When Bryce Perkins graduated, Brennan Armstrong assumed the role of the Virginia football team\u2019s No. 1 quarterback. When Bronco Mendenhall brought in Mississippi State transfer Keytaon Thompson over the offseason, the No. 1 spot became a toss-up. While the starting quarterback for the 2020 fall season is still to be determined, Armstrong holds the edge through the first two weeks of camp. \u201cRight now the slight nod would go to Brennan Armstrong if I was choosing today,\u201d Mendenhall said Friday, \u201cbut we\u2019re four weeks out.\u201d Armstrong holds an advantage in understanding the offense, having spent years learning Robert Anae\u2019s offensive system. The left-handed quarterback draws praise from teammates for elite spatial awareness and feel. While Armstrong isn\u2019t Perkins, he moves well in and out of the pocket. He can tuck the football and run, keeping quarterbacks runs within the offensive design should he earn the starting nod come September. Players like Armstrong, who is becoming more vocal as a leader, and he\u2019s a reliable and promising option at the position. Thompson, on the other hand, is a dynamic athlete. He\u2019s a solid passer, although he\u2019s not quite as consistently accurate as Armstrong. In the running game, he brings the potential for more game-breaking plays than his counterpart. \u201cKeytaon is an amazing athlete and can do a lot of things really well,\u201d Mendenhall said. Similarly to Perkins, Thompson scrambles well. Last season, especially in the first half of the season, Perkins turned poor plays into positive gains. When protection broke down in the pocket, Perkins could move outside, gaining yards with his feet or trying to find an open receiver during scramble drills. Thompson possesses similar skills. \u201cHe can really turn a no-gain play into something big,\u201d senior safety Joey Blount said of Thompson. \u201cI like the way he can use his feet, and he has good vision of what\u2019s going on, not even in front of him but cross-field looks. I think he\u2019s getting that good chemistry with guys.\u201d With the start of the season not coming until potentially Sept. 19 with VMI no longer on the schedule, the Cavaliers have time to work through the competition. There\u2019s time to split reps, if Mendenhall desires. \u201cThey\u2019re making each other better right now, which is great for the team,\u201d senior wide receiver Terrell Jana said of the quarterback battle. Given the developmental nature of UVa\u2019s program, the QB competition presents fascinating differences. While Thompson might be a more gifted athlete, Armstrong possesses a strong understanding of the offense. He also possesses a strong chemistry with receivers and linemen. Armstrong has worked with the receivers and linemen for years, as he occasionally took first-team reps when Perkins was banged up, and Armstrong worked with players the second-team unit with other players also expected to move into first-team roles this season. Virginia\u2019s coaches like both quarterback options as the competition continues late into August. Mendenhall altered the team\u2019s practice plans a bit this preseason due to the need to find clarity at quarterback. He wants to foster chemistry through competitive settings as much as he can between the start of camp and the season opener. \u201cIt started with reps close to being even, as many team situations as we could get in, as fast as we could get in,\u201d Mendenhall said. \u201cOur practice structure has been a lot more team-oriented, with the quarterback decision being the main driver of that. We\u2019ve constructed things really different, not only COVID-wise, but because of our quarterback position.\u201d An altered practice routine helped give Mendenhall a better feeling about the competition at quarterback. Armstrong holds the edge, but Thompson has a little less than month left to attempt to secure the job.","509":"During most years, the Commonwealth Cup matchup between the Virginia and Virginia Tech football teams serves as the final game of the regular season for both programs. But thanks to the COVID-19 pandemic, 2020 is nothing like most years. On Wednesday, the Atlantic Coast Conference announced that Virginia Tech\u2019s scheduled season opener against North Carolina State on Sept. 12 is being moved to Sept. 26 due to a rise in positive COVID-19 tests within the Wolfpack football team. That means the Sept. 19 matchup between the Hokies and Cavaliers at Lane Stadium in Blacksburg is now the season opener for both teams. On Monday, N.C. State announced that it was pausing all athletic activity due to \u201can identified cluster within its programs.\u201d N.C. State did not reveal how many athletes had tested positive for COVID-19 or what sports they compete in. The Wolfpack are adhering to the COVID-19 protocols outlined by the ACC Medical Advisory Group, which requires any student-athlete who tests positive to be isolated for at least 10 days from the onset of symptoms and any student-athlete identified through contact tracing to quarantine for 14 days before returning to activity. With the scheduled season opener between N.C. State and Virginia Tech a little more than two weeks away, the decision was made to push that game back. The Virginia Tech athletic program released a statement on the scheduling change, calling the move a \u201cmutual decision.\u201d \u201cAfter consultation with Atlantic Coast Conference officials, our counterparts at N.C. State and our campus leadership at Virginia Tech, the mutual decision has been made to move the football game between Virginia Tech and N.C. State at Lane Stadium to Saturday, Sept. 26,\u201d the statement said. \u201cVirginia Tech is now scheduled to open the 2020 football season on Saturday, Sept. 19 against the University of Virginia at Lane Stadium. We will continue to provide updates should any further changes to the 2020 schedule be deemed necessary.\u201d Both Virginia and Virginia Tech have seen their season opening opponent change three times due to the pandemic. The Cavaliers were originally scheduled to face Georgia at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta on Labor Day. That game was nixed in late July, when the ACC announced a revised 2020 schedule that included one nonconference game and 10 conference games. The Cavaliers\u2019 new schedule included a season-opening matchup with VMI on Sept. 11, but that game was cancelled after the Keydets opted to postpone their season to the spring. Virginia could find a replacement for VMI on its schedule, but head coach Bronco Mendenhall said recently that he does not expect that to happen. \u201cThe latest I\u2019ve heard is it\u2019s likely we will not replace VMI,\u201d Mendenhall said Friday. \u201cThat\u2019s the latest I\u2019ve heard and so that then would lead to an opening game versus Virginia Tech. Again, it\u2019s not definitive yet. Latest I\u2019ve heard though is that\u2019s the direction we\u2019re headed.\u201d Virginia Tech was originally scheduled to open its season against Liberty at Lane Stadium on Sept. 5. The matchup against the Flames shifted to Nov. 7 and N.C. State became the Hokies\u2019 season-opening opponent when the ACC revised its schedule in July. Now, the Hokies will open the season against the Cavaliers for just the fourth time in program history and the first time since 1972. Meeting virtually The Virginia football team will hold a virtual meet the team day on Saturday. The event replaces the annual in-person meet the team day at Scott Stadium, which can not be held this year due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Among the Cavaliers that will be part of the event are defensive end Mandy Alonso, QB Brennan Armstrong, safety Joey Blount, receiver Terrell Jana, offensive tackle Dillon Reinkensmeyer, linebacker Charles Snowden, running back Wayne Taulapapa, linebacker Zane Zandier and head coach Bronco Mendenhall. They will take part in a live Q&A that will be moderated by Dave Koehn, the Voice of the Cavaliers, on the official Facebook and Twitter pages of Virginia Athletics. This hour-long Q&A will begin at 3 p.m. and is open to all fans.","510":"It has been more than a month since the University of Virginia athletics department last reported a positive COVID-19 test within the 10 programs back in Charlottesville. The low test numbers aren\u2019t a product of luck. UVa\u2019s coaches and athletes feel exceptionally confident in the health protocols in place to mitigate the spread of the virus within the athletic department. \u201cIt\u2019s been remarkable the discipline our team has used, not only our team, but the entire athletic department,\u201d head football coach Bronco Mendenhall said. \u201cOur numbers are staggeringly positive.\u201d Since the football program returned on July 5, 282 student-athletes have received COVID-19 tests. Four of the 282 student-athletes have produced positive tests, with no positives reported since July 24. Health protocols remain the top priority of teams as they prepare for a fall season that could be canceled at any moment due to issues with the coronavirus. For Mendenhall, that means shifting his focus from coaching to managing protocols during practice. \u201cMy coaches are actually coaching football, but what I\u2019m doing is I\u2019m the No. 1 virus manager on our team right now,\u201d Mendenhall said, \u201cand that\u2019s working so far.\u201d The duties of the virus manager include keeping an eye on players to ensure they\u2019re distancing when asked to do so. He also keeps a close eye on the mask-wearing protocols, wanting players to keep their mouth and nose covered as much as possible, given the airborne spread of COVID-19. UVa uses special helmets with both visors and splash shields. While it\u2019s more challenging to breathe with the additional lower shield, the players have adjusted to the additional health protocol. \u201cWe\u2019re wearing the entire full face shields, and I\u2019ve seen some clips from other practices where programs are choosing not to do that, which is mind-boggling to me,\u201d Mendenhall said. \u201cSo we\u2019re wearing the visors and the bottoms. The minute the helmet comes off, the mask comes up. It\u2019s like one motion.\u201d Mendenhall wants players masked as much as possible. The masking and splash shields help lower any potential spread during practice. Outside practice, meals are picked up by athletes at an outdoor location. Players then eat those in their respective rooms. Earlier in the offseason, Mendenhall outlined the team\u2019s lifting protocol. Players worked out in small groups. In between groups, thorough disinfecting practices took place to clean shared equipment. Consistent student-athlete buy-in helps limit the spread of the virus. Regular tests for COVID-19 give programs a chance to isolate athletes who test positive for the virus. While no positives have been reported in a month, the practice aids in the success of the bubble. The success extends beyond just the football program. The UVa women\u2019s soccer program has been preparing for a fall season since its first official practice on Aug. 4. The program practices in masks. Players are tested regularly and practice social distancing when applicable. \u201cWe\u2019re really lucky, because at least we have the capacity to all be together,\u201d junior Rebecca Jarrett said. \u201cWe have facilities where we can social distance and lift. We all have masks, and we can all get tested regularly because we the capability to do so, which not everyone is as lucky to have.\u201d Jarrett and senior goalkeeper Laurel Ivory know athletes at other schools that did not have the same privileges. Some of Ivory\u2019s closest friends from youth soccer attend Pac-12 schools. The Pac-12 doesn\u2019t expect any athletic competition until 2021. \u201cIt was hard to relate to that because we are so lucky that UVa is taking such strong measures and doing everything with our safety as a priority,\u201d Ivory said. \u201cWe compare ourselves to some other schools, where we don\u2019t know the full story, but I think that some ACC schools may not be thinking the same way that UVa is thinking, and it\u2019s 100% the safety and priority of the student-athletes here.\u201d Both student-athletes feel confident in the health protocols in place. They feel so comfortable that they sometimes forget that others \u2014 athletes and the general public alike \u2014 across the country aren\u2019t taking health protocols as seriously. \u201cSometimes you almost forget that there\u2019s so much more to what\u2019s going on than just us,\u201d Jarrett said. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like we\u2019re doing a good enough job where you don\u2019t really realize, yeah, we\u2019re wearing masks in training. We\u2019re going into the locker room in shifts, but it feels pretty normal, pretty safe, to the point where you turn on the news and you\u2019re like, oh, wow, our normal is not normal.\u201d Jarrett says her current interaction with people outside the UVa athletic bubble is close to zero. She goes to practice and interacts mostly with other athletes and coaches while practicing masking and social distancing. Ivory and Jarrett believe in the plan that director of athletics Carla Williams and company put in place for UVa athletes to remain safe amid the pandemic. At times, they both wonder why other programs attempting to play this fall aren\u2019t following the guidelines as strictly as the Wahoos. \u201cIt\u2019s weird because I\u2019m so comfortable and confident in the procedures and policies that we have in place, and when I hear about something else, it\u2019s just like, well why aren\u2019t they doing it like we\u2019re doing it?\u201d Ivory said. \u201cBecause clearly we have it figured out. I think that\u2019s just a testament to Carla and the administration here at UVa.\u201d The athletes also wonder why people in the broader community don\u2019t follow the same general health practices as UVa. While regular asymptomatic testing isn\u2019t nearly as accessible for community members, practicing social distancing and wearing masks come easily to most members of the community. Ivory and company have seen the success wearing masks and social distancing can have on the spread of the virus. They hope others learn from the example of UVa\u2019s sports bubble. \u201cWhen you say all the policies and you say all these rules that we have, it seems like a lot, but then when you\u2019re in it, it\u2019s like OK, this is doable and this is worth doing,\u201d Ivory said. \u201cWe\u2019re just like, why can\u2019t this country do this?\u201d","511":"Traditionally, the undulating grass surfaces at Foxfield in Albemarle County have been reserved for horses competing in steeplechase races. That will change next weekend. Starting Sept. 4, approximately 800 participants are expected to lace up their running shoes to compete in the Charlottesville Women\u2019s Four Miler, which will be held on the Foxfield course over the span of four days. \u201cWe are thrilled with how the event has come together and really excited for Labor Day weekend,\u201d race co-director Audrey Lorenzoni said. \u201dThis is the first time since 1987 \u2014 when UVa hosted the NCAA cross country national championships \u2014 that people are able to walk and run around the grounds of Foxfield.\u201d The race, which is recognized as the oldest and largest all-women\u2019s footrace in Virginia, has been a Central Virginia staple for more than 30 years and has raised more than $3.5 million to local charities. Mark and Cynthia Lorenzoni organized the first race, along with the Charlottesville Track Club, in 1983 and it has grown every year. More than 2,000 women annually take over a two-mile stretch of Garth Road on Labor Day weekend to compete in the event. With the COVID-19 pandemic putting the status of the 2020 race up in the air, race organizers brainstormed to come up with alternatives to keep the tradition alive. \u201cWe knew the race would not be able to be safely held this year in its typical fashion and Foxfield graciously offered its ground for our course,\u201d Audrey Lorenzoni said. \u201cMy parents have been working hard on the course to come up with a beautiful four-mile loop. We also wanted to offer a virtual anywhere option for those who wanted to be able to run or walk from home.\u201d Another unique aspect is this year\u2019s event is that it will be stretched out over four days (Sept. 4-7) to allow participants an opportunity to safely take part in the event. Runners can choose between five 30-minute time slots during the four days and each time slot is restricted to 40 women. Runners and walkers are able to start anytime during their 30-minute window in order to spread out over the scenic Foxfield course. In addition, runners can take part in the race virtually, giving individuals opportunities to compete anywhere. \u201cWe knew we would always have a virtual option, but when Foxfield approached us about using the grounds, we knew we could do something really special,\u201d Lorenzoni said. \u201cWe wanted to do something for all the women who have been a part of this event for years and we are so thankful we are able to do it safely.\u201d Lorenzoni hopes to have close to 800 women walking and running at Foxfield during the four-day event. She also expects a couple hundred others sign up to take part in the virtual anywhere option. \u201cSince it\u2019s a self-timed race, we hope everyone who participated will have a lot of fun out at Foxfield,\u201d Lorenzoni said. The response from competitors has been overwhelming. Heidi Gillenwater moved to Charlottesville 20 years ago and has participated in the Women\u2019s Four Miler nearly every year since arriving in Central Virginia. \u201cIt did not take long for me to realize that this was not just a race, but an event that is a celebration of women and their health,\u201d she said. \u201cWomen of all ages and athletic abilities participate. For some, this is a first step to including regular exercise as part of a healthy lifestyle. For others, it is an opportunity for multiple generations to share an experience.\u201d The race also benefits the UVa Breast Care Program, Foxfield Races, Legal Aid and Justice Center and Blue Ridge Area Food Bank. Gillenwater said the event speaks to her on a very personal level. Her mother is an eight-year cancer survivor after receiving treatment at UVa for Stage 3 breast cancer. In addition, Gillenwater is nearly a year removed from completing treatment for Stage 2 breast cancer. \u201cBoth my mother and I are forever grateful for the funds generated by this event and know first-hand the difference that this makes for patients who receive treatment for breast cancer at UVa,\u201d Gillenwater said. \u201cNeedless to say, I look forward to the Women\u2019s Four Miler every year and worried that, due to the pandemic, this event would be canceled. Maybe I should not be surprised, but the Lorenzonis got creative and figured out a way to make this happen in a safe way on Labor Day weekend. I am beyond delighted.\u201d The same story rings true for Roni Jennings, who honors her mother when competing in the event. \u201cI first ran in 2008, about a month before my mother died after an eight-year battle with breast cancer,\u201d Jennings said. \u201cI ran that year and every race since for my mom. In subsequent years, I\u2019ve added friends and colleagues who are warriors, survivors and victims of breast cancer.\u201d Jennings is excited to run with others and experience the course at Foxfield and continue to enjoy the camaraderie with all the participants in her group. \u201cI love being part of this tradition,\u201d she said. \u201cRunning with women of all ages, levels of fitness and running for different reasons feeds my soul. I am so thankful that a way to have this event was found in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic. Audrey, Nicole and their team of volunteers are amazing.\u201d Jane Jackson is another veteran of the Women\u2019s Four Miler and has experienced it as a runner with friends and family as well as a volunteer. \u201cNo matter how I am involved, it is always a wonderful experience,\u201d Jackson said. The race has become a family tradition for Jackson. Her daughter and cousin have made the trek to Charlottesville the past couple of years to join her and said it is not only a lovely tradition for her family, but for the entire community. \u201cI was thrilled to hear that the race would be happening this year,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cI very much appreciate the careful thoughtfulness and creativity of the organizers in finding a way to keep the race going, especially when so many others have needed to cancel. It was welcome news in an era of anxiety.\u201d Nancy Webber moved to Charlottesville 16 years ago and has participated in the event with her daughters every year since. \u201cWe have had years where we competed. One year, we placed in the top 5 of our age group and my youngest won the 10-and-under [division],\u201d Webber said. \u201cWe even went the complete other way and walked the whole thing, the year my oldest daughter was 33 weeks pregnant. Over 15 events, each daughter has only missed once, despite the fact that they both went to college in Utah and my oldest has lived out of state since 2010. In 2019, my sister and her daughter, both my daughters and my two granddaughters all participated.\u201d Webber always purchases a motivational mile poster in honor of her mother, who died of lung cancer in 2004. In addition, she loves the fact that this is an all-women\u2019s race, organized by women and promoted by women. \u201cThis race is the perfect way to honor her life and her feelings about fitness and women empowerment,\u201d Webber said. \u201cMy favorite part is seeing all the men support the women in their lives that they love. I love watching sons at the water stations, husbands help park cars and dads struggle with children while the little ones hold up signs to tell mom to keep going. I get emotional every years as I run by all the men cheering on the women in their lives.\u201d This year\u2019s race will be a different experience for Webber, who had planned her move from Charlottesville around the Labor Day weekend so she could participate in it virtually \u201cI am now going to be in Catalina Island on race day and am inviting all the women in our boating group to join me for a four-mile run\/walk on the island,\u201d she said. \u201cI can\u2019t want to introduce this very special race to a group of outstanding women.\u201d","512":"In mid-May, ACC commissioner John Swofford called the notion of staging a football season without students on campus \u201cforeign,\u201d an outlook most of us shared. Less than four months later, the prospect seems far more palatable. In fact, until the COVID-19 pandemic eases, virtual bubbles are the best hope for college sports. Some will consider this philosophical 180 a patent money grab and exploitation of young athletes. But while the amateurism model has been shredded, and the financial implications are clear, the pivot in thinking isn\u2019t that cynical. Thousands of players, coaches, administrators and medical advisors in the ACC and five other Football Bowl Subdivision conferences have worked endless hours and sacrificed personal routines to make a season remotely possible. If they succeed, jobs and Olympic sports programs will be spared. If the coronavirus dictates otherwise, if football proves unmanageable, there\u2019s no forecasting the long- and short-term impacts \u2014 football generated about $350 million in revenue for the ACC in 2018-19. And even with the first scheduled game, UAB at Miami on Sept. 10, less than two weeks away, that\u2019s certainly possible. Too many infections and too much quarantining of athletes could doom the season before it starts. But derailing the attempt at this late date, after all this effort, only because full-scale campus life is untenable feels misguided. University presidents appear to concur, and late Friday afternoon the ACC took another step toward the season with an update to its virus protocols. As recommended by the conference\u2019s medical advisory group, ACC schools will test football, field hockey, volleyball and soccer athletes three times per week, with one of the football tests administered the day before competition by a third party chosen by the league. Also, all athletes diagnosed with COVID-19 will undergo a cardiac evaluation, this to monitor the potential heart inflammation associated with the virus. Both updates mirror the protocols in the SEC and Big 12. Back to Swofford\u2019s comments after the ACC concluded its virtual spring meetings May 14. During a video conference, the Greensboro News & Record\u2019s esteemed Ed Hardin asked Swofford if he could envision football games \u201cwithout students actually being \u2026 on campus.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Swofford said. \u201cThat decision may change from institution to institution. That seems foreign to me, personally, because we\u2019re a part of an educational setting in intercollegiate athletics. They are students playing sports. \u2026 \u201cBut we\u2019ll have to wait and see. It\u2019s another unanswered question right now, but most people I talk with in college athletics and higher education, I think, agree that that\u2019s a foreign thought to most of us.\u201d We\u2019ve all had to acclimate to foreign thoughts since March, and this is another example. Virus outbreaks already have prompted two ACC schools, North Carolina State and North Carolina, to send most on-campus residents home and recalibrate plans for in-person classes. League colleague Notre Dame shifted to remote instruction for two weeks but announced Friday a gradual resumption of in-person classes, starting Sept. 2. All three continue to prepare for football and other fall sports, laying bare what many have long understood: Athletes, especially those in the revenue sports of football and men\u2019s basketball, are not like regular students and deserve benefits such as name, image and likeness (NIL) compensation. No matter what transpires with college sports in 2020-21, no matter how courses are taught, the athlete-institution dynamic has been forever and blessedly altered. \u201cNot going to classrooms, that helps us create a better seal around our program and a better bubble,\u201d North Carolina football coach Mack Brown said. \u201cThe NBA model\u2019s working \u2026 and that\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to do, is make sure our players and our staff understand that we\u2019ve got three months here where we cannot go outside for social reasons, or to eat, or anything else if we want to have our football season.\u201d Virginia\u2019s fall semester began Aug. 25, but the school delayed the start of in-person learning until Sept. 8. So I asked Cavaliers football coach Bronco Mendenhall whether he would be comfortable playing if UVa had to take the same steps as UNC and N.C. State. Turns out Mendenhall had recently discussed the question with athletic director Carla Williams and his team\u2019s leadership group. \u201cI love the idea of \u2018student-athlete\u2019 in that order,\u201d Mendenhall said, \u201cand it\u2019s very difficult for me to reconcile having football players on grounds and no other students on grounds from a philosophical perspective. Now if I say that, and I look at my team and see how much they want to play, and they want me to coach them, and they want me to keep them safe, and I want to keep them safe, it\u2019s really tricky, because philosophically and morally, I have a strong thought, and then I have these relationships with my team, and they want to play, and they want me to coach them, and they want to be safe at the same time, and I think I can help them do that. \u201cSo, yeah, I\u2019m conflicted. That\u2019s the best way I can put it.\u201d Scores of coaches, administrators and university presidents undoubtedly are conflicted, too. But Mendenhall\u2019s inner debate has another layer. Mendenhall\u2019s son Breaker is a freshman linebacker at Utah State. But his fall season was canceled when the Aggies\u2019 conference, the Mountain West, decided not to stage fall sports. How does Mendenhall reconcile college football\u2019s fractured state, where roughly half the FBS is attempting to play? \u201cI think fractured might even be an understatement,\u201d he said. \u201cThe gulf and the divisions are huge. I would love consistency. I would love standardized protocols. I would love more leadership, and I\u2019d love more continuity. Acknowledging there are different hotspots around the country. \u2026 \u201cI understand every reason why [the Mountain West canceled]. I\u2019ve seen through the virus\u2019s eyes, and now being a father, it\u2019s made me more empathetic, more compassionate and maybe more holistic in my approach, just because I\u2019ve seen it through a father\u2019s eyes not only a coach\u2019s eyes.\u201d More than most, Mendenhall relies on practice measurables to assess his team. But this preseason he\u2019s delegated more evaluation tasks to his staff and forged a new role for himself: protocol Enforcer in Chief. Are players properly distanced when not active in a drill? Do they don masks immediately after removing their helmets? Whenever the answer is no, there are unpleasant consequences. \u201cI\u2019ve never run a practice structure like we\u2019re currently running, Mendenhall said. \u201cThere\u2019s really nothing about our program that looks the same as what a normal organization looks like. I\u2019ve erred really, really far on the side of caution and safety. And at some point, we\u2019re going to have to add enough football to be ready to play. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve just been holding out to see truly, to be honest, if we are going to play. And what will the leadership say and will there be some kind of direction that way that may be more concrete than what we currently have.\u201d Comprised of the league\u2019s 15 presidents, the ACC\u2019s Board of Directors figures to provide more specific direction within a week. Regardless of campus populations, the current consensus is all systems go.","513":null,"514":"Some scoffed when reading season preview stories. Months ago, COVID-19 seemed destined to derail the fall college football season before it left the tracks. Instead, Tuesday marks the first day of September and three Power 5 conferences still plan to take the field this fall. A pair of FCS squads competed in a game Saturday. Yes, an actual college football game took place over the weekend. While COVID-19 outbreaks on campuses still threaten the fall season on a daily basis, programs keep working in hopes that enhanced safety protocols will pay off. With college football season inching closer, the ACC recently announced increased testing requirements for its football programs. Keeping the virus at bay remains a top priority. If the plans \u2014 which include testing football teams three times per week \u2014 work, a safe season could very well occur this fall with the Pac-12 and Big Ten watching from the sidelines. A possible season means the ACC pushes forward with a few traditional measures, including an upcoming reveal of the preseason All-ACC squad and the projected order of finish. I voted for this year\u2019s preseason All-ACC team and projected finish, and much like UVa does with its COVID-19 testing results, I wanted to be transparent. All-ACC team Quarterback: Clemson\u2019s Trevor Lawrence \u2014 Even with Sam Howell as an option, Lawrence is the no-brainer choice. Lawrence also earned my preseason Player of the Year selection. I think he unseats his teammate Travis Etienne for the honor this season. Running backs: Clemson\u2019s Travis Etienne and Louisville\u2019s Javian Hawkins \u2014 Two elite returners earn the nod at running back. Wide receivers: Florida State\u2019s Tamorrion Terry, Louisville\u2019s Tutu Atwell and North Carolina\u2019s Dazz Newsome \u2014 Dyami Brown nearly earned a selection to give a pair of UNC players spots on my list, but I opted for Atwell, Newsome and Terry. All three players have proven experience, good hands and blistering speed. Tight end: Miami\u2019s Brevin Jordan \u2014 Jordan is a consistent threat in the passing game, which isn\u2019t common for college tight ends. He\u2019s almost like another receiver on the field for the Hurricanes. All-purpose back: Louisville\u2019s Hassan Hall \u2014 Scott Satterfield and Louisville use Hall well in a variety of ways. He runs well, and he\u2019s a dynamic kickoff returner. Look for Hall to make critical plays for the Cardinals in 2020. Offensive tackles: Notre Dame\u2019s Liam Eichenberg and Boston College\u2019s Ben Petrula \u2014 I\u2019m a sucker for experience, and both Eichenberg and Petrula have it. Offensive guards: Boston College\u2019s Zion Johnson and Notre Dame\u2019s Aaron Banks \u2014 Banks consistently excels when being rated by Pro Football Focus. The senior should post impressive ratings again in 2020 for a loaded Notre Dame offensive line. Center: Pittsburgh\u2019s Jimmy Morrissey \u2014 Another Pro Football Focus star, Morrissey enters the fall as the conference\u2019s top center. He excels both in run and pass blocking. The former walk-on is one of the best linemen in the conference. Defensive ends: Wake Forest\u2019s Carlos Basham Jr. and Miami\u2019s Quincy Roche \u2014 Roche dominated at the AAC level with Temple, and fans may be surprised at how well his game translates to the ACC. He\u2019s a special pass rusher. Basham Jr. was extremely productive in 2019. Defensive tackles: Florida State\u2019s Marvin Wilson and Clemson\u2019s Tyler Davis \u2014 Wilson leads Florida State on and off the field. He\u2019s a legitimate NFL prospect. Davis, a sophomore, will find his way onto an NFL roster in future seasons. Linebackers: Virginia Tech\u2019s Rayshard Ashby, North Carolina\u2019s Chazz Surratt and Virginia\u2019s Charles Snowden \u2014 Ashby and Surratt were easy selections. Snowden barely earned a spot on the list. I gave him a spot on the All-ACC teams in part because of his potential. Added muscle should help Snowden turn an impressive volume of quarterback hurries into even more sacks. Expect a big season from Snowden, assuming his fellow linebackers don\u2019t reach the quarterback first. Cornerbacks: Florida State\u2019s Asante Samuel Jr. and Clemson\u2019s Derion Kendrick \u2014 Both players are disruptive corners with NFL potential. Safeties: Pittsburgh\u2019s Paris Ford and Florida State\u2019s Hamsah Nasirildeen \u2014 These two safeties can make plays in coverage, but they\u2019re both adept tacklers. The tackling ability puts them over the top. Kicker: Wake Forest\u2019s Nick Sciba \u2014 Through two seasons, Sciba is 43-for-47 on his field goal attempts. It doesn\u2019t get much better than that. Punter: Clemson\u2019s Will Spiers \u2014 With Miami\u2019s Lou Hedley not on the ballot, I opted for Spiers. The Clemson punter boasts solid length strength, as well as the ability to pin teams within the 20 without booting the ball into the end zone. Keep an eye on Hedley this season, though. He\u2019s one of the ACC\u2019s most underrated punters. Specialist: Duke\u2019s Damond Philyaw-Johnson \u2014 He averaged an impressive 32.3 yards per kickoff return in 2019. When Philyaw-Johnson gets the ball in his hands, he\u2019s dynamic. With Joe Reed out of the picture, Philyaw-Johnson becomes the ACC\u2019s scariest kickoff returner. ACC ballot 1. Clemson In recent seasons, the ACC featured a clear-cut No. 1 team. Expect more of the same, at least entering the fall season. Quarterback Trevor Lawrence enters the season as a Heisman trophy contender, and Travis Etienne might be the best running back in the country. Defensively, the Tigers remain talented at multiple positions. Tyler Davis is poised for a special sophomore season at defensive tackle. The special teams unit features talented performers, with punter Will Spiers adept at pinning opponents inside the 20. Dabo Swinney\u2019s club is the team to bet yet again in the ACC. 2. North Carolina Sophomore quarterback Sam Howell returns an abundance of weapons, including wide receivers Dazz Newsome and Dyami Brown. The Tar Heels feature one of the most potent offenses in the ACC. Mack Brown\u2019s team went 7-6 in 2019. All six of UNC\u2019s losses came by one possession. In the final six games of the season, North Carolina went 4-2 with an overtime loss to Pitt and a close loss to UVa thanks to timely fourth-quarter stops from Virginia\u2019s defense. In the final three games of the season, North Carolina went 3-0 with all three victories coming by at least 30 points. The Tar Heels are ready to become an ACC contender. 3. Notre Dame Competing in the ACC this season, the Fighting Irish should be among the league\u2019s best squads. Ian Book is an elite quarterback with tremendous experience. A solid offensive line should make Brian Kelly\u2019s squad explosive on offense. A six-game span in the middle of the season puts the Irish against Louisville, Pitt, Clemson and North Carolina. Those four games will be massive challenges, with the showdown against Clemson on Nov. 7 potentially holding massive importance. 4. Louisville Micale Cunningham is a dual-threat quarterback with impressive passing efficiency. Javian Hawkins enters the fall as the second-best running back in the ACC, and wide receiver Tutu Atwell might be the fastest player in the conference. Expect Louisville to score in bunches. If the defense performs at an above-average level, it\u2019s hard to see the Cardinals finishing worse than fifth in the ACC. 5. Pittsburgh Pitt\u2019s defense features All-ACC caliber talent across the board. The Panthers are loaded in the secondary and across the defensive front. Paris Ford might be the top safety in the ACC, and he leads a defense that should be among the conference\u2019s best. Only Georgia Tech scored fewer points per game than the Panthers a season ago, though. Kenny Pickett needs to stay healthy at quarterback, and the Panthers need to move the ball effectively. If they do, they could be a sneaky pick to make the ACC Championship Game. 6. Virginia Tech The Hokies are good, but I\u2019m not sure they\u2019re great. Regardless, they\u2019re deserving of a spot in the top half of the ACC. Hendon Hooker deserves more praise at quarterback, and there\u2019s depth behind him. Rayshard Ashby enters 2020 as arguably the ACC\u2019s best linebacker. Virginia Tech is good, and they should be better than a season ago, even if the record doesn\u2019t show a massive improvement. 7. Virginia When reading national stories about UVa, you\u2019d think Bryce Perkins was a reigning four-time Heisman trophy winner. Losing him hurts, but Brennan Armstrong deserves much more respect than he\u2019s getting. The UVa players and coaches rave about his accuracy and awareness, and he won the job over a dynamic athlete in Mississippi State transfer Keytaon Thompson. The offensive line possesses experience to protect Armstrong. Questions at running back and wide receiver make the offense a work in progress. An early season trip to Blacksburg makes it nearly impossible to ease Armstrong into the season. Virginia\u2019s offense won\u2019t be bad, but it might take a few weeks to find a rhythm. Defensively, there\u2019s solid experience along the defensive line and in the secondary. The Cavaliers\u2019 linebackers might be the best in the league with Charles Snowden and Noah Taylor spearheading a dynamic group. Zane Zandier is as reliable as they come at the linebacker position, and JMU transfer D\u2019Angelo Amos adds important depth in the secondary. UVa returns a good roster, and Bronco Mendenhall and company added a few quality transfers in addition to Amos. Unfortunately for the Wahoos, games against Clemson, North Carolina and Louisville require either elite defensive play or an explosive offense capable of winning a shootout. I\u2019m not sure UVa\u2019s secondary can stop high-powered passing attacks, and the questions at wide receiver and running back are alarming given the increased potential of players missing games due to COVID-19. The Cavaliers might shock folks this season, but the question marks make it hard to project UVa finishing better than fifth. The ACC is much improved this season. 8. Florida State Mike Norvell\u2019s first season leading the Seminoles comes during a pandemic. Fortunately, a handful of quality defenders including defensive lineman Marvin Wilson lead a defense capable of keeping Florida State in most games. Questions linger on offense for the Seminoles, who need to find consistency to win enough games to finish in the top half of the ACC. James Blackman owns a powerful arm at quarterback, but at times he\u2019s been erratic and fell short of his potential. Norvell needs an offense capable of scoring consistently. 9. Miami QB D\u2019Erig King, a Houston transfer, might be the perfect medicine for a team with a subpar offensive line. The speedy quarterback can turn broken plays into long gains. But in a league filled with elite defensive linemen and linebackers, how long can King last behind a group that finished in the bottom four in the FBS in sacks allowed in 2019. The Hurricanes also struggled rushing the football, ranking last in the ACC in rushing yards per game last season. King helps, but he doesn\u2019t make Miami a top-tier ACC program. 10. Wake Forest With Jamie Newman at Georgia, it\u2019s Sam Hartman\u2019s turn at Wake Forest. Unfortunately for the new quarterback, Sage Surratt opted out of the season, leaving Hartman without one of the best wide receivers in college football. 11. N.C. State Dave Doeren\u2019s Wolfpack finished 4-8 last season with a 1-7 record in conference play. After five consecutive seasons with winning records, N.C. State should bounce back a little bit in 2020, even if it still ends up in the bottom half of the league. 12. Georgia Tech Transitioning away from a triple-option offense takes time. Year No. 2 should include some improvements for the Yellow Jackets. 13. Boston College It\u2019s a tough year to take over an ACC program, but that\u2019s the task facing Jeff Hafley. The new head coach joins a program that typically features a talent deficit to the top-half of the ACC. Recruiting in future seasons will be critical to the program\u2019s chances of contending for an ACC title. Four of the team\u2019s final five games this season come against Clemson, Notre Dame, Louisville and UVa. Hafley\u2019s group could be in for a long season. 14. Syracuse Dino Babers\u2019 club missed Eric Dungey at quarterback in 2019. Tommy Devito played well, but a lack of offensive line help made his job tough, and he isn\u2019t the same explosive rusher as Dungey. Defensively, Syracuse also struggled. The Orange weren\u2019t much of a threat a season ago, and the ACC should be much improved in 2020. 15. Duke Clemson transfer Chase Brice gives the Blue Devils a solid option at quarterback, but Duke doesn\u2019t have the firepower to compete with most of the ACC.","515":"Barring any scheduling changes, Virginia and Virginia Tech will open their 2020 football seasons against each other in the Commonwealth Cup. The ACC announced game times for the first two weeks of the 2020 season, and the Cavaliers and Hokies will face off on Sept. 19 at Lane Stadium on ABC. The game will kick off at either 3:30 or 7:30 p.m., with the final determination taking place after the games on Sept. 12. A matchup between Miami and Louisville also is set for 3:30 or 7:30 p.m. on Sept. 19. After the opening week games, one of the contests will earn a prime-time slot while the other contest will be held at 3:30 p.m. The announcement of game times makes the season feel more tangible. COVID-19 caused the Pac-12 and Big Ten to cancel their fall football seasons, but the ACC, Big 12 and SEC remain on course to play this fall. With the calendar flipping to September, UVa\u2019s football season is less than three weeks away from starting. Increases of COVID-19 within the athletic program or campus community still threaten the season, but the ACC believes it can start on time and play football this fall. That means months of following stringent health protocols could leave the Wahoos with the reward of opening the season with a critically important game. \u201cIt\u2019s gonna be exciting to get there,\u201d safety De\u2019Vante Cross said Tuesday. \u201cI can\u2019t wait for that day just because all we\u2019ve been through, living in the bubble, going through the different protocols and measures \u2026 it\u2019s just gonna be a blessing to be able to play the game that we love.\u201d Attendance for the opener with the Hokies will be low, given the state\u2019s current guidelines on large gatherings. Mike Barber of the Richmond Times-Dispatch reported earlier this week that crowd noise will be allowed to be pumped into ACC venues. Virginia Tech also plans to offer cardboard cutouts of fans, similar to what some professional venues have allowed with in-person attendance limited. It\u2019s going to be an unusual Commonwealth Cup. Fan attendance may be low, but fan interest from the outside will be high. Even with fan engagement, it won\u2019t be the same feel as a typical season when the programs meet at the end of the season for a showdown around Thanksgiving. \u201cNot having a build up to Tech week is kind of different,\u201d cornerback Nick Grant said. \u201cNobody\u2019s ever done this before, but I feel like having them coming off of what we\u2019ve been through with quarantine, with being home since after spring break, with not having spring ball, no contact football really until these past couple weeks, I feel like that puts it in a different context for the urgency of this season.\u201d The Cavaliers haven\u2019t jumped into Virginia Tech preparation just yet \u2014 the focus lies on improving as a team before diving into film study \u2014 but Grant and company expect an intense few weeks. A season opener demands attention. A nationally televised season opener against your biggest rival after months of uncertainty surrounding the season brings an even greater sense of urgency and pressure. The players eagerly await the game\u2019s arrival and the expectations that come with it. \u201cI feel like starting with them is very, very rewarding,\u201d Grant said, \u201cespecially because everything we\u2019ve been though and everything this team has sacrificed to play football this year.\u201d","516":"Instead of wrapping up practice and grabbing a bite to eat with a group of friends at a dining hall, University of Virginia athletes conclude practice and then head back to their isolated living locations, perhaps stopping by a designated tent to pick up food. The fall 2020 season looks unlike any other both on and off the field. Returning to fall sports competition amid the COVID-19 pandemic requires health and safety protocols not needed during a typical preseason. Even with the safety measures, practices still resemble a standard training session. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s gonna get used to wearing a mask, but the drills that we do, we\u2019re still doing the same thing,\u201d UVa field hockey player Rachel Robinson said. \u201cWe\u2019re still going hard.\u201d While the athletic activity remains similar despite increased safety regulations, the social activities when practice ends don\u2019t mirror a typical season. With programs adding freshmen and transfers, building team chemistry off the field usually fills time outside practice. Players spend time together in groups, becoming friends off the field in settings as simple as eating next to each other in dining halls. Social distancing makes integrating first-year athletes and transfers a bigger obstacle than most seasons. \u201cI would say that\u2019s probably one of the most challenging things out of everything,\u201d Robinson, a senior, said. \u201cYou\u2019d think being on the field would be challenging, but I mean you get to play hockey, so you don\u2019t get to really think about anything else. Social distancing definitely requires us to be a little more creative.\u201d Field hockey players break into smaller groups, according to Robinson. Players aim to hang out with the people they\u2019re likely to spend the most time with during the season. Instead of large team social gatherings, smaller and socially distanced events take priority. For the men\u2019s soccer program, building team chemistry holds additional importance. Between transfers and freshmen, UVa added 13 new players to a team that made it to the national title game a season ago. \u201cWe have a group chat where we talk to each other every day,\u201d senior Nathaniel Crofts said. \u201cIf anyone needs anything, we reach out to them. A lot of players, we play XBOX, PlayStation. We go online together and stuff, so that\u2019s probably the best way we can stay connected.\u201d Goalkeeper Colin Shutler added that a few players on the team took up golf over the summer. Occasionally, members of the program head to the course for socially distanced fun. Outside of golf, Shutler, like Crofts, enjoys competing with teammates in video games. Some players watched \u201cMoney Heist,\u201d a four-part Netflix series, together to pass the time. The group finished it toward the middle of August. Despite social distancing requirements the men\u2019s soccer programs finds creative ways to stay engaged. Shutler credits the dorm-living experience as a process that helps the freshmen. Living in the same dorm lends itself to healthy opportunities to bond. The upperclassmen often take on leadership roles off the field, checking in on younger athletes to ensure the transition to college amid a pandemic goes smoothly. \u201cThe guys here definitely have a good circle going,\u201d Shutler, a fifth-year senior, said. \u201cWe\u2019re watching out for each other.\u201d Women\u2019s soccer senior goalkeeper Laurel Ivory keeps a close eye on the freshmen to ensure they follow all the necessary health precautions during and after practice. \u201cIt\u2019s not so much policing, it\u2019s more like course correcting,\u201d Ivory said. \u201cMore like, \u2018OK, we\u2019re gonna bring you back in. We\u2019re not gonna go all the way over there.\u2019 It\u2019s just kind of like switching their head and pointing them in the right direction.\u201d Ivory credits the first-year class for following instructions and embracing the health protocols in place. She\u2019s proud of their effort to stay healthy. It\u2019s a challenging time to enter a Division I soccer program, especially given the social opportunities that usually present themselves prior to and during a fall semester. Instead, UVa wants to limit large social gatherings when students return to Charlottesville for the start of undergraduate in-person classes on Sept. 8. For freshmen Olympic sport athletes, they\u2019re joining a Division I program for a fall season without fall national championships. Their social lives are drastically altered, and the season could be canceled at any moment should COVID-19 spread within the campus community or athletic department. It\u2019s a challenging year, and finding ways to provide a positive experience for first-year players wanting to perform well and become friends with teammates is a focus of UVa\u2019s upperclassmen. \u201cYou\u2019d think that it would be, \u2018Man, I can\u2019t believe the seniors are experiencing this,\u2019 but it really is flipped in my eyes,\u201d Ivory said. \u201cI can\u2019t believe the first years are experiencing this because I remember my first year and just how many people I met and how many friends I got to know and just different things I got to experience and take part in, and they\u2019re getting stripped of that and that is heartbreaking for me.\u201d","517":"The Los Angeles Chargers drafted Reed to add versatility to the roster. Reed, who plays running back, wide receiver and kick returner, provides exactly that. Despite no preseason games this year due to COVID-19, the Chargers have liked what they\u2019ve seen from the dynamic former UVa standout during preseason camp. \u201cWhen I watch Joe on film, it reminds me a little bit of Percy Harvin,\u201d Chargers head coach Anthony Lynn said. \u201cNot quite as explosive as Percy, but a guy that can do multiple things. He can line up at receiver, line up in the backfield. He\u2019s a kick returner. We can use Joe in multiple ways, but right now at that position at receiver and in the backfield, there\u2019s a lot of good competition going on there, so Joe\u2019s got his work cut out for him.\u201d Competition is stiff with each NFL team needing to cut its roster down to 53 players by Saturday. Luckily for Reed, his status as a drafted rookie with position versatility plants him firmly within the 53-man roster for Los Angeles. He\u2019s likely to not only make the roster, but to also play on Sundays. Chargers special teams coach George Stewart loves Reed\u2019s physical ability at kick returner. While Stewart admits most NFL kickers knock the ball through the end zone, Reed offers the ability to turn limited kick returns into big plays. \u201cHe has that physical strength, he has great vision and he has big-time speed,\u201d Stewart said. \u201cThose three things will give him an opportunity to be successful.\u201d Stewart says after seeing Reed for the first time, he was pleasantly surprised at his size. He\u2019s built bigger than most kickoff returners, which helps him run through arm tackles. Bringing down Reed proved challenging for collegiate players. During his time at Virginia, Reed became the only player in FBS history to log 2,700 kickoff return yards with an average return of at least 28 yards. He\u2019s one of just 10 FBS players to reach 3,000 career kickoff return yards. He finished his illustrious UVa career with five kickoff returns for touchdowns. Reed won\u2019t be the only UVa player in the mix to return kickoffs for Los Angeles. Darius Jennings, who averaged 31.7 yards per kickoff return for Tennessee in 2018, may see time at the position as he battles for a roster spot at receiver and on special teams. Jennings is far from a lock to make the 53-man roster, and he may sweat it out Saturday waiting for official word. If he does land on the roster, expect special teams to be a key reason why. \u201cI\u2019m not putting everything on Joe Reed, but he had great success at Virginia and they\u2019re bringing him into the fold along with Darius Jennings, who I\u2019ve seen personally return kickoffs in this league for touchdowns,\u201d Stewart said. For Reed, position versatility remains his strength. Few players in the league perform productively at multiple offensive positions. The players capable of making an impact as receivers, runners and returners typically earn roster spots and demand touches within offensive schemes. Position versatility makes Reed an exciting NFL prospect and it also means he needs to split time working with different position groups. Los Angeles gives Reed time at running back, wide receiver and kickoff returner. \u201cThat\u2019s nothing new for me,\u201d Reed said. \u201cMy whole career from high school to college up until now I\u2019ve been about to bounce around and play different positions.\u201d Without preseason games, Reed\u2019s running back skills may be a bit shaky entering the season. He says it\u2019s different to practice at running back, and learning pass protections is one of his goals as he aims to provide additional depth in the backfield. At wide receiver, Reed wants to read defenses better. He\u2019s noticed coverages changing after the snap, which differs a bit in complexity from the collegiate level. No preseason games makes the NFL adjustment slightly more challenging ahead of Los Angeles\u2019 season opener against the Cincinnati Bengals on Sept. 13. Regardless of the obstacles facing Reed, he\u2019s a sure bet to make the team\u2019s 53-man roster, and he\u2019s stoked to fulfill his aspiration of playing in the NFL. \u201cPutting on this uniform is definitely a dream come true,\u201d Reed said. \u201cGrowing up, I just wanted to play professional ball. Coming home after church and watching football and now finally being able to put this uniform on today, especially on Sunday and being able to come out here and compete, just loving the speed of the game and the physicality. We\u2019ve been waiting a long time, especially this year it seems like this offseason has been going on forever so just having a chance to come out here and compete with my teammates has been a true blessing.\u201d","518":"Despite solid production and elite athleticism, Perkins slipped out of the draft due to questions about his consistency as a passer. UVa fans, and Bronco Mendenhall, felt the quarterback went overlooked. Shortly after the draft, however, Perkins\u2019 ability generated interest from NFL teams. He signed with the Los Angeles Rams as an undrafted free agent. Typically, undrafted free agents use the preseason to showcase their abilities in hopes of making a 53-man roster. Unfortunately for Perkins, changes sparked by COVID-19 led to the cancellation of all preseason contests this season. With NFL teams needing to trim their rosters down to 53 players by Saturday at 4 p.m., Perkins sits on the outside looking in, according to prominent Los Angeles Rams beat reporters. ESPN\u2019s Lindsey Thiry projects Jared Goff as the starter and John Wolford as the backup. She only expects the Rams to keep two quarterbacks on the 53-man squad. The Athletic\u2019s Jourdan Rodrigue predicts the same. Rodrigue added in a recent article that she expects Perkins to be one of the Rams\u2019 four protected practice squad players. The protected designation, which was added as part of a few COVID-19-related rule changes, means opposing teams won\u2019t be able to sign Perkins if he joins the Rams\u2019 practice squad. That would give Perkins a chance to develop in Los Angeles\u2019 system this season, while standing by should players miss time with injuries or COVID-19. Eric Williams, a reporter for Sports Illustrated, tweeted Saturday that \u201cBryce Perkins has some juice.\u201d When asked how he looked at a Saturday scrimmage, Williams responded with one word: \u201cFast.\u201d Even so, Williams told a few UVa fans in his mentions that he doesn\u2019t see Perkins taking the No. 2 spot from Wolford. He sees Perkins as a practice squad candidate. Most projections place Perkins as the Rams\u2019 third quarterback option. Head coach Sean McVay could surprise the experts by keeping three quarterbacks on the active roster, but Perkins looks the part of a practice squad candidate ahead of Saturday\u2019s cuts. On the plus side for Perkins, the Rams recently released fellow undrafted rookie free agent Josh Love to give Perkins a closer look. He has the inside track to making the practice squad at quarterback. \u201cBryce has done a nice job,\u201d McVay said. \u201cHe\u2019s earned the right to be able to get a couple more reps and for us to evaluate him.\u201d Goff, who recently signed a four-year contract extension worth more than $130 million, is a lock to be named the Week 1 starter. Behind Goff, McVay likes Wolford. The third-year professional quarterback out of Wake Forest spent last season on the Rams\u2019 practice squad, so he has more experience in McVay\u2019s system than Perkins. Wolford also possesses decent mobility, with McVay even comparing him to Doug Flutie, according to an article from ESPN\u2019s Thiry. While Perkins doesn\u2019t have the inside track to making the 53-man roster, COVID-19 raises his chances of joining the squad at some point this season. Positive tests could put players on the sideline for weeks at a time, which could lead to Perkins being called up from the practice squad. Even if Perkins doesn\u2019t land on the 53-man roster Saturday, it\u2019s not out of the question that UVa\u2019s former star quarterback lands on the roster at some point in 2020. At the very least, the Rams liked him the most of their 2020 undrafted quarterback signings. That was made clear after they released Love. No preseason games likely prevents Perkins from making a run at the backup quarterback job, but Perkins\u2019 mobility should be enough to keep him on the Rams\u2019 team in some capacity, even if it\u2019s serving as a practice squad quarterback.","519":"Health and depth should prove critical in the upcoming fall college football season. Between typical injuries and positive COVID-19 tests as well as quarantine protocols, teams could be without large chunks of players for weeks at a time. With the fall college football season approaching \u2014 Virginia plays Virginia Tech on Sept. 19 \u2014 Bronco Mendenhall joined the media Thursday and shared a handful of key personnel updates. Walker\u2019s waiver appeal Ronnie Walker Jr. transferred from Indiana to UVa this offseason. Walker Jr.\u2019s initial waiver application for immediate eligibility was denied. According to Mendenhall, the appeal was also denied. That\u2019s not the end of the road for Walker Jr. this season, though. UVa still has time to win an appeal for the running back\u2019s eligibility. \u201cJust to educate everyone on the process, you send in the waiver, and then based on that outcome you have a chance to appeal and the appeal can be approved or denied and then there\u2019s 30 days after that, that you still keep working,\u201d Mendenhall said. \u201cSo we\u2019re still in the process, and we will be for 30 days so I won\u2019t be able to give you a final answer until at the end of that so we\u2019re going to work hard all the way to the very end and exhaust every chance in that process.\u201d Adding Walker Jr. would add depth to a thin running back room. Opt-outs For weeks, Mendenhall had alluded to five players opting out of the 2020 season. He wouldn\u2019t completely rule any of them out for returning, however. Ben Smiley, a redshirt freshman defensive end, was one of those five. He\u2019s returned to Grounds and will practice with the team soon. \u201cBen Smiley is back and has some initial quarantine work to do and we\u2019re thrilled, so happy about that,\u201d Mendenhall said of adding the defensive lineman. Mike Hollins, a sophomore running back, was already announced as one of the players opting out. He\u2019s joined by defensive lineman Aaron Faumui, cornerback Tenyeh Dixon and wide receiver Dorien Goddard. \u201cWe expect everyone else to stay and play,\u201d Mendenhall added. Faumui is an experienced and talented defensive lineman for the Wahoos. Losing the junior hurts. Through two seasons, he played in 26 games with nine starts. Dixon played in nine games last season as a freshman. The defensive back stepped into action after injuries decimated the secondary. Goddard, who possessed good size at wide receiver, played four games last year and retained his redshirt. He entered this fall as a redshirt freshman. Hollins remains a key blow, given the lack of depth at running back. Injury updates Expect a few players to return to the practice field next week for the Wahoos. \u201cAntonio Clary is back,\u201d Mendenhall said. \u201cNathaniel Beal most likely will be back this coming week at wide receiver. Rob Snyder, most likely, will be back this coming week as well. Those are probably the three big ones that have been out for a while and those are all likely to return next week. Bobby Haskins at offensive line, offensive tackle, probably the following week.\u201d Clary, a defensive back, came back earlier this week. Adding Clary and Snyder, a linebacker, back into the mix helps with defensive depth. Beal will have a chance to compete for time at a thin position group, while Haskins should mix into the offensive line rotation when he joins the group in practice.","520":"Bronco Mendenhall likes Virginia\u2019s current 10-game, all-ACC schedule. The Cavaliers open with Virginia Tech on Sept. 19, face Clemson two weeks later and square off with high-powered teams such as North Carolina and Florida State along the way. While Mendenhall feels comfortable with the slate, the ACC wants UVa to add another opponent. \u201cI would prefer it remain that way because I think 10 is safer than 11, in terms of games,\u201d Mendenhall said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a matter-of-fact statement, but it\u2019s been made pretty clear to me that the ACC would like us to have a plus-one, so there are options being pursued.\u201d Under ACC COVID-19 guidelines, nonconference games need to come in the ACC team\u2019s home state. That leaves home games or road contests within the commonwealth as potential plus-one options. Originally, Virginia was slated to play Georgia in Atlanta. After that game fell through due to COVID-19, UVa added VMI to the schedule. Shortly after the addition, VMI announced it wouldn\u2019t play football this fall. That leaves UVa in its current position. The Wahoos hold open dates for Week 1 \u2014 next weekend \u2014 as well as Sept. 26 and Nov. 21. There\u2019s still a chance logistics don\u2019t work out and the Cavaliers don\u2019t add another team to the schedule. With the potential for an 11th game, however, fans want to know who might fit UVa\u2019s schedule. At the FCS level, 15 teams plan to play at least one game this fall. All 15 of those squads are outside Virginia. For any FCS squad to join the schedule, they\u2019d need to meet ACC COVID-19 health protocols, which could be a financial challenge unless UVa foots the bill. Those teams would also need to come to Virginia. On the other hand, most FCS teams are only playing a few games, making those programs available for potential games on UVa\u2019s open dates. That\u2019s not the case at the FBS level. Six FBS conferences hope to play fall football. That leaves AAC, Big 12, CUSA, SEC and Sun Belt teams as potential 11th opponents for UVa. The Big 12 wants all nonconference games wrapped up by the start of conference action on Sept. 26. That takes the Nov. 21 date off the table, but leaves the Sept. 12 and Sept. 26 weekends open. Unfortunately for UVa, the closest Big 12 squad in geographic proximity \u2014 West Virginia \u2014 has games scheduled on both weekends. The SEC went to a conference-only slate, taking potential matchups with that Power 5 league off the table. Finding an opponent in September presents a challenge. Most teams have schedules lined up, and UVa has the majority of its weekends booked with games. Could a team like Marshall, which has an open date on Sept. 26, be a possible addition? It\u2019s unclear who the Cavaliers might add, but the program is still looking for a possible 11th opponent at the recommendation of the ACC. \u201cWe could announce a plus-one, and that\u2019s in the works, but if you\u2019re asking me what I would like to do, 10 is safer than 11,\u201d Mendenhall said.","521":"Laurel Ivory stood tall as one of the ACC\u2019s best goalkeepers in 2019. With Diana Ordonez and Meghan McCool on attack, Virginia blossomed into one of the most fearsome college soccer teams in the country. Unfortunately, an injury to Ivory in the ACC Tournament championship match hurt the team at goalkeeper and took a leader off the field. The result of the late-season injury was a surprising second-round NCAA Tournament loss to Washington State. A year later, the Wahoos return several key pieces from their 2019 squad. COVID-19 took away the chance at a fall championship, however, so the Cavaliers will play 11 ACC contests this fall before hopefully contending for a national championship in the spring. The uncertainty caused by the coronavirus has made preparing for the season difficult, but the team largely feels grateful to be in Charlottesville preparing for the season, which starts on Sept. 12 at home against Virginia Tech. Last season\u2019s results Virginia finished the 2019-20 season with a 17-2-3 record, including a 6-0-3 mark in ACC play. The Cavaliers were elite, going undefeated until the ACC championship match. The team only lost when Ivory was injured, although she played most of the ACC championship match before suffering her jaw injury. With Ivory healthy, the Cavaliers were electric. They excelled both offensively and defensively in 2019. Steve Swanson\u2019s group finished the season fourth nationally in scoring offense, averaging nearly three goals per game. UVa finished seventh nationally in goals allowed per game. Notable departures Meghan McCool, Courtney Petersen, Zoe Morse and Phoebe McClernon are four massive losses. McCool gave UVa a reliable scoring threat every match, while the other three athletes combined to form one of the most fearsome defensive units in the country. All four players were consistent options at their positions. Virginia enters the fall missing a handful of critical pieces from the 2019 squad. Notable returners Ivory is a key piece at goalkeeper. She\u2019s expected to be one of the country\u2019s best. Alexa Spaanstra, who spends time at forward and midfield, returns for her junior season. She\u2019s an elite facilitator, leading the team with 12 assists a season ago. Sophomore Diana Ordonez led UVa with 34 points as a freshman. She\u2019s one of the best underclassmen nationally and expected to remain a vital part of UVa\u2019s efforts. Junior Rebecca Jarrett is experienced at the forward and midfield positions. She earned a spot on the ACC all-tournament team last season. Other upperclassmen, such as senior Sydney Zandi and junior Ashlynn Serepca, possess experience and add quality depth to the squad. Both players should see the field in 2020. Senior Anna Sumpter started 18 times a season ago, offering proven ability at the midfield position. She game up with a clutch goal in a draw against Wake Forest to open ACC action. Fellow senior Taryn Torres is one of the best midfielders in the ACC. She\u2019s back for another year. Look for Claire Constant to compete for a more prominent role defensively. \u201cThe pieces are there, and we\u2019re excited about this group,\u201d Swanson said. \u201cIf how they\u2019ve handled the protocols and the policies and the restrictions that we\u2019ve put in place is any indication of the kind of team we have, I feel really positive moving forward.\u201d Notable additions UVa added a 2020-21 recruiting class ranked second nationally by Top Drawer Soccer. The talented group of recruits adds depth to a team with numerous returners. Sarah Clark, a transfer from Purdue, is an athlete to keep an eye on. The defender started 36 of a possible 37 games during her time as a Boilermaker, and she earned Big Ten All-Freshman Team honors in 2017. 2020-21 outlook COVID-19 alters how the season will look. No fall national title presents an unusual set of circumstances for the Wahoos, but the team returns elite talent at multiple position groups. If the Cavaliers stay healthy, they should be in the mix for the ACC title this fall and a national championship in the spring.","522":"The Cavaliers will allow for \u201cthe lesser of 50 percent occupancy of the facility or 1,000 patrons\u201d at home sporting events this fall. The decision follows guidelines provided by state officials. Unfortunately for Virginia fans, the athletic department also announced that \u201cUVa home competitions will be limited to family of student-athletes and each team\u2019s coaching staff until further notice.\u201d Fans not related to players or coaches will have to watch from home for the time being. UVa says it will make additional announcements on attendance should state officials make changes to the restrictions surrounding large gatherings. \u201cWe are excited that our student-athletes have the opportunity to return to competition soon, but unfortunately, we will have to do so without fans to start the season as we follow the state and local agency guidelines regarding the operation and capacity of our athletic venues,\u201d Carla Williams, UVa\u2019s director of athletics, said in a release. The guidelines apply to all of UVa\u2019s home fall sports programs. This means only 1,000 fans will be permitted inside Scott Stadium when the Virginia football team takes the field. UVa may welcome fewer than 1,000 people, since only family members of student-athletes and coaches will be allowed to attend. The Cavaliers averaged 47,811 fans per game a season ago, and the Cavaliers brought in crowds of more than 52,000 people in three home contests. That won\u2019t be the case this season. Other programs, like UVa\u2019s soccer teams, the field hockey program, volleyball and cross country also face capacity limits. Given the smaller team size of those groups and only family members of players and coaches being allowed, it\u2019s likely home attendance will fall below 1,000 people. \u201cThese are unprecedented times and we are thankful for the patience and continued support of everyone,\u201d Williams said. Williams encouraged fans to stay up-to-date with game coverage through the team\u2019s social media feeds, VirginiaSports.com and through television coverage.","523":"While Virginia fans won\u2019t be able to attend the games in-person \u2014 unless they\u2019re related to a student-athlete or coach \u2014 the promise of a fall season certainly excites UVa supporters hoping to watch their teams in action on TV or through streaming platforms. There won\u2019t be fall NCAA championships due to COVID-19, but the ACC believes it can safely hold fall seasons and conference championships. Virginia\u2019s fall athletic programs learned their paths to their respective ACC postseason events Friday. Men\u2019s soccer Let\u2019s start with the UVa fall Olympic sport program that had the most success in 2019. The Cavaliers were a successful penalty kick shootout away from winning the national championship last year. Despite losing a few key pieces to the professional ranks, the Cavaliers hope to win the ACC again in 2020. Here is a look at Virginia\u2019s fall schedule: Sept. 11 vs. Clemson Sept. 18 vs. Syracuse Those two contests represent exhibitions in Charlottesville prior to the start of the season. The team will compete in what the ACC is dubbing the \u201cNorth Region.\u201d The group includes Louisville, Notre Dame, Pitt, Syracuse and Virginia Tech. The top four teams in the region qualify for the ACC Tournament quarterfinals on Nov. 15. Oct. 2 at Virginia Tech Oct. 9 vs. Louisville Oct. 16 vs. Pittsburgh Oct. 23 at Notre Dame Oct. 30 at Syracuse Nov. 6 vs. Virginia Tech UVa plays a game per week, which falls in line with what head coach George Gelnovatch wanted when discussing scheduling this offseason. While six games aren\u2019t many, there\u2019s an ACC championship on the line this fall. Women\u2019s soccer Despite an early NCAA Tournament exit, the Cavaliers came just short of winning the ACC Tournament last season. They were among the best ACC teams all season. With a key group of returners, the Wahoos hope to maintain that momentum entering 2020. UVa plays an 11-game slate this fall. Sept. 12 vs. Virginia Tech Sept. 17 at Duke Sept. 20 at Clemson Sept. 25 at Virginia Tech Oct. 1 vs. Pittsburgh Oct. 4 vs. Miami Oct. 8 at North Carolina Oct. 15 vs. Louisville Oct. 18 vs. Florida State Oct. 29 at Boston College Nov. 1 at Syracuse It\u2019s worth noting that only eight of UVa\u2019s 11 games count as ACC games. Both matches against Virginia Tech and the Oct. 8 showdown at North Carolina will be designated nonconference games. The ACC quarterfinals begin on Nov. 10. Field hockey Fresh off a Final Four appearance last year, the Cavaliers feature a quick, conference-only slate. Sept. 26 and 27 vs. Wake Forest Oct. 2 and Oct. 4 vs. Syracuse Oct. 11 and Oct. 12 at North Carolina Oct. 18 at Boston College Oct. 23 and 24 vs. Louisville Oct. 31 at Duke The Cavaliers face four opponents twice over a three-day stretch, which should make for exciting competition as coaches and teams attempt to adjust to facing the same squad in such a short time frame. The first round of the conference tournament begins on Nov. 5. Volleyball The ACC volleyball season begins on Sept. 17 and runs through Oct. 25. The 15 ACC squads form three regions, with UVa joining a pod with Duke, North Carolina, N.C. State and Virginia Tech. Virginia plays its four region opponents twice to wrap up a fall season. Oct. 2 and 3 vs. Duke Oct. 9 and 11 at North Carolina Oct. 16 and 18 at Virginia Tech Oct. 23 and 24 vs. N.C. State The weekend of Oct. 31 is available for potential make-up games. There is no ACC Tournament. Cross country UVa\u2019s cross country program will compete in three events prior to the ACC Championship on Oct. 30, which includes all 15 men\u2019s and all 15 women\u2019s programs. Sept. 25: Virginia Invite Oct. 7: N.C. State Invitational Oct. 16: Virginia\/Panorama Farms Invitational Both Virginia events take place at Panorama Farms in Earlysville, while the N.C. State event is going be held in Cary, North Carolina.","524":"Bronco Mendenhall told the media Thursday he liked the idea of UVa playing an all-ACC schedule this fall, but the ACC wanted the Cavaliers to add a nonconference game. He felt his team would be safer playing 10 contests. The Cavaliers ultimately listened to the ACC\u2019s request. Virginia announced Friday that Abilene Christian, an FCS squad, will join UVa\u2019s 2020 schedule. The Wahoos will host the Wildcats on Nov. 21. Abilene Christian, which went 5-7 a season ago, will compete in a limited fall schedule this season. Abilene Christian faces UTEP on Sept. 19 before a matchup with Army on Oct. 3. The Wildcats also play contests against five teams outside the FBS level. The matchup with UVa is the team\u2019s final contest of the 2020 season. The game will sandwich between matchups with Duke and Florida State for the Cavaliers. Given the added opponent, Virginia Tech officially becomes UVa\u2019s season opener. The Cavaliers head to Blacksburg on Sept. 19. A game on Nov. 21 also means the Cavaliers play in 10 consecutive weeks beginning on Oct. 3 at Clemson. From Oct. 3 through Dec. 5, the Cavaliers will play every Saturday. Between injuries and players missing time due to positive COVID-19 test, competing in 10 consecutive weeks is a sizable challenge. UVa\u2019s weekends off come on Sept. 12 and Sept. 26. The Wahoos receive a bye week prior to facing Clemson, which helps, but playing every week from early October through early December demands excellence in health protocols relating to physical maintenance and COVID-19 precautions. Abilene Christian finalizes the schedule for Bronco Mendenhall and company, barring any additional changes brought on by COVID-19. Here\u2019s the full slate: Sept. 19 at Virginia Tech Oct. 3 at Clemson Oct. 10 vs. N.C. State Oct. 17 at Wake Forest Oct. 24 at Miami Oct. 31 vs. North Carolina Nov. 7 vs. Louisville Nov. 14 vs. Duke Nov. 21 vs. Abilene Christian Nov. 28 at Florida State Dec. 5 vs. Boston College Saturday marks two weeks until the start of Virginia\u2019s 2020 football season. UVa fans will then have to wait another two weeks for the Cavaliers to take on Clemson. Once the game with Clemson kicks off, however, Virginia fans can look forward to 10 consecutive weeks of Virginia football \u2014 assuming COVID-19 outbreaks don\u2019t lead to postponements or cancellations.","525":"The University of Virginia athletics department announced Friday that it recorded five new positive COVID-19 tests since its last report on Aug. 21. The athletic department says every new positive test came from individuals who recently returned to Grounds. Since its last report, UVa has brought 15 more athletic programs back to Grounds. That means all 25 of UVa\u2019s varsity sports programs are back in Charlottesville. The total number of student-athletes tested jumped from 282 in the last report to 568 for Friday\u2019s report. In total, there have been nine positives tests produced by the 568 student-athletes since testing began, according to UVa\u2019s latest information. Testing began when the Virginia football team returned to Grounds on July 5. Of the nine student-athletes who tested positive for COVID-19, none have required hospitalization. The football program did not report any additional positive tests in the latest update. Bronco Mendenhall\u2019s team has not reported a positive COVID-19 test since the July 24 report. That\u2019s good news for the Wahoos as they prepare for their season opener on Sept. 19 against Virginia Tech. Since returning to Grounds on July 5, 117 football student-athletes have been tested for COVID-19. The school has reported three positive tests since then, with none coming since the July 24 report. With 117 football players back, there are 451 athletes who play other sports back on Grounds and have been tested for COVID-19. Only six of those 451 athletes have produced positive tests, according to the numbers shared by UVa. Friday\u2019s report will be the final testing report before the school begins competition next weekend. Both soccer programs play next weekend, with the men\u2019s squad taking place in an exhibition on Sept. 11. The women\u2019s squad plays a match on Sept. 12. During the fall season, UVa\u2019s teams will follow the updated testing protocols recently announced by the ACC. The ACC testing protocols require three tests per week \u2014 beginning the first week of competition \u2014 for football, field hockey, soccer and volleyball players. The athletic department has not shared how many tests it\u2019s completed to this point, but rather the number of student-athletes tested.","526":"Jack Stelter loves competition and thrives when the stakes are high. The former Woodberry Forest swimmer will have an opportunity to challenge himself on college swimming\u2019s biggest stage after committing to the University of Tennessee for the 2021-22 school year. \u201cTennessee is the school of choice for me because I feel as though it will give me all the resources I need to succeed, both in and out of the pool,\u201d Stelter said. \u201cI believe that Tennessee is going to be in a position to win major titles in the coming years and I want to be a part of that. The team seemed very focused on one common goal and that was winning an SEC championship.\u201d Stelter swam three years at Woodberry Forest and left his mark on the program. As a senior, he captured two individual state titles and a pair of relay crowns for the Tigers. Not bad for someone that didn\u2019t take up the sport until his sophomore year in high school. Stelter started swimming for BASS in Orange and later for J.J. Bean and the Virginia Gators. \u201cThat was a fun experience, but as I got older, I wanted to play sports with my school friends,\u201d he said. \u201cI was planning to play football my sophomore year in high school, but changed my mind at the last minute. That decision had a huge impact on my life and swimming at Woodberry Forest for the three years helped me to develop not only as a swimmer, but as a person, in and out of the pool. I was fortunate enough to be able to train with J.J. Bean and the Gators in the summer months to keep me in shape during that gap time.\u201d The competitive drive was fueled at an early age by his brother, Sam, a rising senior swimmer a Woodberry Forest. \u201cEver since I was young, I was always competing with my brother,\u201d Jack Stelter said. \u201cI never liked to lose anything, whether it was a game of 1-on-1 basketball in my backyard, or challenging my brother to build a cooler Lego rocket ship. I was always finding something to do to compete.\u201d That competitive drive was evident earlier this year as Stelter led the Tigers to a second-place finish at the VISAA state championship meet. He captured state gold in the 100-yard freestyle (45.57) and the 200-yard freestyle (1:39.69) and set school records in the 200 and 500 free. In the relay events, he sparked the 400 free relay team and swam anchor leg on the 200-medley relay that both earned All-American honors. In addition, he captured gold in the 200 free relay to earn a clean sweep of school records at the state meet. Stelter said his state performance was pivotal in his recruitment to Tennessee. \u201cI believe that the coaches like my size and my time drops,\u201d he said. \u201cI also believe they see ways in which they can improve my technique. I dropped nearly three seconds in my 100, four seconds in my 200 and about 16 seconds in my 500 from junior to senior year. I began swimming competitively as a sophomore, so I believe that they saw quite a bit of potential in me. Also, because I am also new to the sport, I feel as though I am far from burned out and am motivated to get better.\u201d It\u2019s been a whirlwind year for Stelter. Last fall, he verbally committed to swim at Towson University. Those plans changed last spring, when the COVID-19 pandemic wreaked havoc on the country. Stelter reconsidered his options and decided take a year off from school. \u201cThe decision to take a gap year and decommit form Towson was a very hard decision,\u201d Stelter said. \u201cI was thrilled to be able to swim for [Towson coach] Jake Shrum. Had the coronavirus not happened, I would still be fully committed to Towson. However, at the end of the day, my family and I did not feel comfortable sending me to college in an area where the COVID numbers were rising, where most of my classes would be virtual and a swim season was iffy at best.\u201d After reopening his recruiting, Stelter had interest from several ACC and SEC programs and narrowed his choices down to Virginia Tech and Tennessee. \u201cThe decision to commit to Tennessee over Virginia Tech was very difficult for me,\u201d Stelter said. \u201cI believe that both programs are moving in the right direction and offer a lot for student-athletes. However, I like the idea of going somewhere completely new. A lot of people from Virginia go to either UVa or Virginia Tech, so I wanted to try something different. I also loved Knoxville and I believe the city itself has a lot to offer. After living in a small town all my life, I am excited about the idea of living in Knoxville.\u201d One of the major draws to the Volunteers\u2019 program is the specific training each swimmer receives. \u201cTennessee has a large coaching staff and three 50-meter pools,\u201d Stelter said. \u201cThis gives the program the ability to reach individualize practices. I feel as though the coaching staff will work with me to create a very specific and detailed plan about how I am going to drop a lot of time.\u201d During his gap year, Stelter plans to train with his former high school coach, Greg Guldin, to prepare for life as a collegiate swimmer. \u201cAt the collegiate level, I hope to have an impact soon,\u201d Stelter said. \u201cI would like to make the conference and NCAA teams. I believe that Tennessee has the ability to win conference championships and set themselves up to win NCAA championships in the future and I hope to be a part of the start of something great.\u201d","527":"Josh McCarron, one of the top recruits in the Virginia football team\u2019s 2021 recruiting class, stood on the steps of the Washington State Capitol in Olympia, Washington, on Thursday, wearing his high school jersey. Flanked by several peers, McCarron delivered an impassioned speech. \u201cThis is more than just sports,\u201d McCarron said at the end of his address. \u201cFor many, this is an opportunity to go to college. This is an opportunity to escape reality, to help deal with mental [health] issues. This is an opportunity to bring a group of young kids together and help them learn the skills to become future leaders. We need this and we are prepared to do whatever for it. We need your help to make this happen and want to help and support in whatever way possible. I ask you [Washington] Gov. [Jay] Inslee, will you let us play?\u201d McCarron joined a group of high-school athletes from Washington in asking Inslee for their fall sports seasons back. With numerous states playing high school football this fall, McCarron and others believe it\u2019s safe for Washington to do so as well. A July announcement from the Washington Interscholastic Activities Association pushed fall sports to the spring, but the athletes hope a reversal is a possibility. Michigan changed course Thursday after a similar initial decision, allowing high school football and a few other sports to take place this fall. On Aug. 14, the Michigan High School Athletic Association planned to move the season to the spring. Students created a few campaigns to save their seasons, and the state eventually flipped its decision. A recent executive order from Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer opened gyms across the state while also allowing organized sports to resume. It appears Inslee paid attention to the group of Washington high schoolers protesting and pleading for a fall season. \u201cThe Governor took notice, so we\u2019re speaking with him next week,\u201d McCarron told The Daily Progress. While the group is still working out a specific meeting time for next week, McCarron is hopeful he may regain his fall football season. Being an athlete in one of the states that postponed fall athletic competition to the spring brings with it emotional pain. McCarron knows players from across the country, and it\u2019s tough for the Everett, Washington native to see teams and friends in other states compete each weekend. According to the CDC, Washington had reported 3,153 COVID-19 cases in the past seven days as of Friday. Utah reported 2,894 in the same time frame. Utah, however, started high school football on Aug. 14, becoming the first state to kick off its 2020 season. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty painful and difficult to hear,\u201d McCarron said. \u201cWatching my friends from Utah, Georgia and Texas play their sport, and I\u2019m also in love with that same sport, it\u2019s just hard to watch.\u201d Georgia reported 14,214 cases in the past week, checking in as the state with the fourth-most COVID-19 cases in the last week, per the CDC data from Friday. While total case counts aren\u2019t the only relevant data point, and state population as well as population density can skew total case numbers, Washington has fared better at handling the virus in recent weeks than several states in the southern U.S. Despite impressive COVID-19 numbers in relation to the rest of the country, McCarron and his peers are on the verge of losing their fall sports seasons. At the beginning of McCarron\u2019s speech, he says spoke with a friend in Georgia and learned about the state\u2019s protocols for playing high school football. They include contact tracing, mask wearing and limited team periods to reduce potential exposure to the virus during practice. For those who do become ill, they take classes online while quarantining from peers. Some Washington schools, including McCarron\u2019s, are already providing instruction virtually, so he says accommodating online classes for sick students shouldn\u2019t be a problem. It\u2019s worth noting that there have been cancellations and postponements of high school games in Utah because of COVID-19 cases within teams. Other games in Utah and other states have been played safely this fall, though. With some states implementing health protocols and playing during the pandemic without creating major outbreaks due to games, McCarron and others believe Washington can craft a plan to safely play fall high school football. \u201cWe have lower cases than a lot of those states, and we have a lot better resources than a lot of those states, McCarron said,\u201d so what is stopping us from being in that group?\u201d The talented prospect emphasized the importance of his teammates and peers competing. He\u2019s locked into a scholarship offer with a Power 5 program, but some of his teammates need time on the field to put themselves in position to earn college scholarships. Others use the practices and games as a break from the stresses of everyday life. McCarron and company know the risk the virus presents. They also don\u2019t believe playing high school football games puts the community in greater danger. High schools in other states are competing this fall. After a few weeks watching from afar, McCarron wants his state to join in on the gridiron action. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty hard to watch, but I think we got our message across yesterday,\u201d McCarron said Friday, \u201cand I hope we have some good news coming soon.\u201d","528":"With the ACC Coastal Division title at stake, in a game replete with fourth-quarter drama, Virginia used 52 players in last season\u2019s football victory over Virginia Tech. The Hokies used 49. One year earlier, in a double-overtime contest won by Tech, 55 Cavaliers and 50 Hokies saw the field. Irrelevant on most occasions, game-day roster size is paramount this fall as the ACC and five other Football Bowl Subdivision conferences attempt to compete amid a pandemic. During a season in which COVID-19 and subsequent contact tracing could shelve a significant portion of a squad, how many available bodies do you need for a game? How many at each position? Should conferences establish minimums that, if not met, would mandate postponement or cancellation? If so, would walk-ons count toward the minimum? How many players can you prepare to play multiple positions? Those are among the questions coaches and league officials are pondering with the season less than a week away. In concert with the conference\u2019s medical advisory group, ACC schools appear inclined to be flexible with numbers and leave game fitness decisions to team doctors. Conversely, the Big 12 on Friday adopted a 53-man minimum that must include at least seven offensive linemen, four defensive linemen and a quarterback \u2014 walk-ons included. Like so many other questions surrounding the coronavirus, good luck discerning which approach is best. \u201cI think that it\u2019s going to have to be more nuanced,\u201d Virginia coach Bronco Mendenhall said. \u201cAt one point, the ACC coaches, this topic came up and it was an interesting discussion and an interesting dialogue. But the number of scenarios and the different thresholds and what might be at stake in the game based on record and some of the things that could be built in to variable standards by team I think is really hard to mitigate. \u2026 \u201cAnd I don\u2019t know if for some reason there [were] hard numbers, that would have to come from the medical community. And all of us, I\u2019m sure, are cross training some players, some positions, to ensure that we have enough, but man, really hard for me to say. I don\u2019t have a model in my head what it would look like. But I\u2019m sure there are some that have pretty strong feelings.\u201d With in-person learning yet to start at UVa, and the football team living in what Mendenhall describes as \u201ca fortress,\u201d the Cavaliers\u2019 training camp has been infection-free for weeks. But several of Virginia\u2019s opponents, including Virginia Tech, North Carolina and North Carolina State, confronted COVID-19 cases when students returned to campus. N.C. State and UNC paused workouts, and the Wolfpack\u2019s Sept. 12 road contest versus the Hokies was postponed until Sept. 26. The daily chaos is taxing. \u201cI\u2019m a basket case,\u201d Tech coach Justin Fuente said with a smile. From August until season\u2019s end, Fuente is rarely expansive with reporters. But this topic animated him. \u201cIt\u2019d be nice,\u201d Fuente said of measurable roster guidelines. \u201cI understand how difficult a task it is, too. I say that \u2014 football is such a different sport in terms of being so position specific. You can\u2019t line up your offensive linemen at DB, obviously. \u2026 If it hits one position group, it greatly affects not just your ability to play but the health and safety of the other players on the field for both teams. You can imagine \u2014 offensive line gets used a lot \u2014 but there\u2019s a bunch of positions where it\u2019s not just making sure you have a quarterback. It\u2019s the health and safety of the other people on the field. Do you end up playing with guys that should never be out there to begin with? \u201cI mean, we have a bunch of great kids in our program and some of them are really, really young and underdeveloped and are not ready to play in an ACC football game. Are we going to count those guys? Are we not? Nobody really knows. And I\u2019m not criticizing the fact, because I do believe it\u2019s a very difficult decision to make.\u201d Including walk-ons, Power Five rosters routinely exceed 100 \u2014 the FBS scholarship maximum is 85. The ACC usually caps travel squads at 72 but expanded the limit this year to 80. Similarly, the NFL has adjusted for this virus season. Rosters remain at 53, but the practice squad was expanded from 10 to 16. Moreover, the minimum time on injured reserve was reduced from eight weeks to three weeks. No matter the numbers, few will be surprised if infections disrupt schedules, beyond what we\u2019ve already seen with Virginia Tech-N.C. State. Miami is set to host UAB on Thursday, followed by a busy Saturday that includes four conference matchups: Duke-Notre Dame, Clemson-Wake Forest, Syracuse-North Carolina and Georgia Tech-Florida State. \u201cIf we\u2019ve got enough guys that are healthy enough to play, and it doesn\u2019t matter who they are [to] make the game safe, then we should play even if we\u2019re at a true disadvantage that some of our best players aren\u2019t playing,\u201d North Carolina coach Mack Brown said. \u201cThat should not determine whether we play or not. But we would wait and our doctor would be the only one that would tell us that we couldn\u2019t play. \u2026 \u201cI trust doctors, and I trust coaches. I know coaches are competitive, and they want to win. But none of us are going to put a young guy on the field that\u2019s not safe, for him, or for the opponent.\u201d","529":"When the Virginia football tam takes the field against Virginia Tech on Sept. 19 in Blacksburg, the Cavaliers hope to roll out a healthy first-team lineup. By the time the season ends \u2014 and UVa tries to navigate a stretch of 10 games in 10 weeks \u2014 the starting units could look drastically different. From injuries to positive COVID-19 tests putting players on the sideline for potentially weeks at a time, the 2020 fall season figures to deplete rosters. Bronco Mendenhall is preparing for this potential reality. Virginia\u2019s head football coach is placing an emphasis on cross training; practicing players at multiple position groups should athletes go down with injuries or positive tests for the coronavirus. \u201cThere\u2019s a possibility of an athletic offensive lineman learning some defense at defensive line,\u201d Mendenhall said. \u201cThere\u2019s the chance of a linebacker learning tight end or vice versa, or linebacker to running back or safety to running back.\u201d Mendenhall says the cross training isn\u2019t massively widespread as of early September, but he\u2019s moving players around in some capacity. He added that having even one player on each side of the ball capable of competing on the other side provides value. Mendenhall doesn\u2019t need dozens of players able to switch from offense to defense, but if the tight end group has multiple players test positive for COVID-19, bringing a linebacker into the fold for a couple weeks could help the team withstand the blow. While moving a linebacker to tight end is an extreme example of cross training, having cornerbacks who can play safety is something Mendenhall likes even in typical seasons. The UVa defensive backs embrace position versatility and understand that being able to play any position in the secondary increases their chances of seeing the field this fall. \u201cThe more you can do on the field, like whether you can play nickel, outside corner, boundary corner, free safety or our strong safety position, that\u2019s gonna benefit you on getting to the field, so a lot of the players that we have play multiple positions,\u201d cornerback Nick Grant said. Position versatility could prove critical should players miss chunks of time due to positive COVID-19 tests. Even if the team stays healthy, being able to mix and match in the secondary ensures defensive coaches can be creative against opposing passing attacks. Offensively, a few cross training possibilities make sense. Shane Simpson, a Towson transfer, plays running back. Despite not possessing enough size to be an outside receiver, he boasts excellent hands and is capable of lining up as a slot receiver when needed. Billy Kemp IV, a slot receiver, can make the switch to running back if needed, given his speed and quickness. Even some of Virginia\u2019s quarterbacks are candidates to cross train. Mississippi State transfer Keytaon Thompson is known for his athleticism. At 6-foot-4 and 215 pounds, Thompson could see practice reps at tight end or wide receiver. Freshman quarterback Ira Armstead holds similar athletic traits to Thompson. He\u2019s another potential option should the receiver group be diminished during the year. \u201cIt just makes sense for not only any year, but especially this year,\u201d Mendenhall said. \u201cThose are cross-training natural fits that certainly we\u2019ll consider, because again, it\u2019s not a normal year.\u201d Mendenhall embraced the challenge of quarantine throughout the spring, and he tried to get his team to do the same. He wants his squad determined to overcome the potential obstacles created by an unusual fall season. That includes understanding the selflessness of cross training. Guys may grow up believing they\u2019re destined to be a star at one position, but this fall Mendenhall needs them to put those dreams aside should the team need them to suit up elsewhere. \u201cAll I can really tell you is that I play defense, and that\u2019s all I got for you,\u201d safety De\u2019Vante Cross said.","530":"When Virginia announced its recruiting class for the 2020 early signing period in December, head coach Bronco Mendenhall raved about Ira Armstead. He felt the Cavaliers found an unheralded gem in the quarterback from Indiana. \u201cWe love his length, we love his athleticism, we love his measurables,\u201d Mendenhall said of Armstead. UVa\u2019s head coach even compared Armstead to Bryce Perkins, days before Perkins put together an electrifying performance in an Orange Bowl loss to Florida. Even with comparisons to Perkins by Mendenhall, few top-tier FBS programs showed interest in Armstead. Rivals ranked him as a two-star prospect, and Virginia was the only Power 5 squad to offer him a scholarship, according to the site. Several of the teams pursuing Armstead were squads at the FCS level. The FBS teams showing interest play in the MAC. Virginia entered the recruiting fold as the best team, at least in terms of recent on-field performance, pursuing the quarterback. Armstead selected UVa, giving himself a chance to showcase his talents at the ACC level. Armstead arrived at Virginia this past winter, but missed spring ball with the rest of his teammates due to COVID-19. Since returning to Grounds with the team this summer, Armstead has showed coaches why they fell in love with his game in the first place. Listed at 6-foot-3 and 210 pounds, Armstead possesses tremendous rushing ability and athleticism for a quarterback. The arm strength is there, too. \u201cHe was a mid-year [enrollee] but we didn\u2019t get obviously any work with him in the spring, but he\u2019s a really athletic player and has good arm strength,\u201d quarterbacks coach Jason Beck said. \u201cHe still [has] a ton to learn, a ton to adjust to, but he has the tools to be able to develop into a really good quarterback at this level.\u201d Understandably, the newcomer needs to learn the offense before competing for game reps at the position, but Virginia coaches like Armstead. Mendenhall went out of his way to praise Armstead during a Thursday media session, saying \u201cIra has been better faster than what we anticipated.\u201d Learning offensive coordinator Robert Anae\u2019s scheme remains the biggest challenge facing Armstead this preseason. Athletically, the Wahoos love what the freshman brings to the field. During his final two high school seasons, Armstead rushed for more than 1,700 yards and found the end zone with his legs a whopping 26 times. Much like Perkins, Armstead can turn a broken play into a long gain. Impressively, high school highlights also show Armstead tossing an accurate deep ball. He\u2019s a big play waiting to happen. \u201cHe\u2019s long and he\u2019s tall and he\u2019s fast and he\u2019s dynamic and he\u2019s productive and he\u2019s elusive,\u201d Mendenhall said. \u201cAnd he\u2019s catching up in terms of playing the position of quarterback, and he\u2019s catching up in terms of the scheme. He\u2019s catching up in terms of his assignments. But wow, the other parts are really impressive.\u201d Fortunately for Armstead, there\u2019s time to develop. Brennan Armstrong won the starting quarterback job this fall, and he\u2019s a redshirt sophomore. While there\u2019s no guarantee Armstrong retains the job for three seasons, there\u2019s a scenario where Armstead waits his turn for three years before gunning for the starting job. A redshirt is a possibility for Armstead, but that doesn\u2019t mean he won\u2019t take the field in 2020. Positive COVID-19 tests and injuries could lead to Armstead playing at quarterback. His athleticism also means he\u2019s a prime candidate to practice at other positions should depth be an issue late in the season as UVa attempts to navigate a stretch of 10 games in 10 weeks. Mississippi State transfer quarterback Keytaon Thompson may also practice at other positions given his athleticism and role as a backup. Mendenhall loves Armstead\u2019s athleticism. In what\u2019s expected to be a strange college football season, UVa fans may see a glimpse of Armstead\u2019s talents earlier than originally expected. If not, the Indiana quarterback will attempt to follow Armstrong\u2019s path of serving as a backup quarterback and learning the offense. In a few years, UVa fans may see the starting role passed from Armstrong to Armstead.","531":"Labor Day weekend is known for family cookouts, a final trip to the beach and the start of the football season. In Central Virginia, the September holiday often is highlighted by the annual Charlottesville Women\u2019s Four Miler. Despite a global pandemic, a new course and a unique format, this year\u2019s Four Miler, which concluded Monday at Foxfield, was completed successfully. \u201cIt was such a wonderful weekend,\u201d co-race director Audrey Lorenzoni said. \u201cand I have had nothing but rave reviews.\u201d The Four Miler, which is recognized as the oldest and largest all-women\u2019s footrace in Virginia, has been a staple in the area for more than 30 years. The event has raised more than $3.5 million to local charities. The race traditionally is run on a Saturday morning over a two-mile stretch of Garth Road. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, a traditional version of the race was not possible. But Lorenzoni and other race organizers found a creative way to safely put on the event under this year\u2019s unique circumstances. First, the race was moved to the Foxfield turf course, which is traditionally reserved for steeplechase races. This was the first time since 1987, when UVa hosted the NCAA Cross Country Championships, that runners were permitted to compete on the grounds. \u201cWe are so grateful to Foxfield and the people who made it possible for us to host this event this year on the grounds,\u201d Lorenzoni said. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t have done it without the help of Gerald Shifflett, Jack Sanford and the Foxfield board.\u201d In addition to the new venue, the other big change was the race format. Instead of all runners competing at once, the race was held over four days to allow runners to compete in a socially distant setting. A virtual race option also was added to this year\u2019s event for runners that wanted to participate, but were unable to come to Foxfield. Lorenzoni said approximately 619 women took part in the race in person at Foxfield over the four days and approximately 320 others took part in the event virtually. \u201cWatching women get out of their cars and walk up to the start with their daughters, sisters, mothers or best friends and start the race together was special,\u201d Lorenzoni said. \u201cIt was also special to watch the women who ran or walked alone.\u201d Rachel Ward, a two-time state champion at Albemarle High School, submitted the fastest recorded time for the event (24:50). It was ninth Four Miler victory for Ward, a 30-year-old nurse at UVa Medical Center, but the win is considered unofficial since it was self-timed. Lorenzoni said the event has raised more than $30,000 for local causes so far and fundraising will continue through the end of the month. This year\u2019s race is raising money for the UVa Breast Cancer Center, Legal Aid Justice Center, The Blue Ridge Area Food Bank and Foxfield. Holding the Four Miler over four days at a new course was a big undertaking, but Lorenzoni and her staff was able to successfully hold the event thanks in large part to the help of race volunteers. \u201cWe had amazing volunteers who helped all four days, including Tom Hitz (head of parking committee), Dr. Robert Wilder, director of UVa\u2019s Runner\u2019s Clinic (head of medical team), Arthur and Liz Lichtenberger, Megan McGroddy, Rick Willis and Marti Naro,\u201d Lorenzoni said. \u201cWe had more wonderful help with setting up and taking down the course, including Adrian Lorenzoni, Mark Lorenzoni and Jack Masloff. We also had many more volunteers that helped keep the participants safe.\u201d Audrey Lorenzoni hopes the event helped to bring back some feeling of normalcy to the area, especially the running community. \u201cIt was truly an emotional event this year, more so than past years, as 2020 has been a challenging year for all of us and watching the women do something for themselves was very moving,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was such a positive weekend and everyone seemed to really love it.\u201d","532":"Despite a handful of key players departing, the Virginia men\u2019s soccer team enters an abbreviated 2020 fall season with the pressure of expectations. The Cavaliers were named the ACC North Region favorite Tuesday after a vote conducted by the conference\u2019s head coaches. COVID-19 led to a shortened fall schedule, and it also led to the ACC creating North and South Regions this fall. The Cavaliers received nine of the 11 first-place votes for teams in the North. Pittsburgh received a pair of first-place votes and is projected to finish second in the region. Virginia Tech, Syracuse, Louisville and Notre Dame round out the North Region. UVa also received one vote to win the ACC this season. Clemson led the way with five votes, while Wake Forest earned four. North Carolina joined UVa by receiving one vote as well. ACC favorite Clemson led the way in the South Region voting, followed by Wake Forest, North Carolina, N.C. State and Duke. Virginia was the only team in the North Region to receive a vote to win the ACC, while three of the five South Region teams earned votes to win the league this fall. UVa begins its ACC title defense without key contributors such as Joe Bell, Daryl Dike and Henry Kessler, but the Wahoos return goalkeeper Colin Shutler as well as Nathaniel Crofts, an offseason force for the group. The forward is the lone UVa player to earn a spot on the 11-player preseason watch list. The Cavaliers open their six-game regular season on Oct. 3 at Virginia Tech. They play a pair of home exhibitions prior to the trip to Blacksburg, hosting Clemson on Saturday before hosting Syracuse on Sept. 18. The ACC quarterfinals begin on Nov. 15. UVa women picked third The Virginia women\u2019s soccer team was picked to finish third in the ACC in Tuesday\u2019s preseason coaches poll. Steve Swanson\u2019s team received two first-place votes. A year after falling just short in the ACC Championship Game, the Cavaliers hope to take home the conference title. Laurel Ivory returns at goalkeeper, while star sophomore Diana Ordonez paces the team\u2019s attack. UVa enters the fall slate loaded at multiple positions. Ordonez and junior forward Alexa Spaanstra both earned spots on the preseason All-ACC team. Even with the Cavaliers returning talent from a successful 2019 team, the conference is talented. North Carolina, which won the ACC a season ago and lost in the national championship match, enters the year as the team to beat, according to the ACC coaches. The Tar Heels earned eight of the 13 first-place votes. Florida State also sits ahead of the Cavaliers, earning the No. 2 selection in the 13-team league. The Seminoles garnered three first-place votes. There won\u2019t be an NCAA championship this fall due to COVID-19, but UVa begins its season Saturday with a matchup against Virginia Tech. There\u2019s still plenty to play for despite the NCAA postseason likely taking place in the spring. UVa plays 11 games this fall. Each contest comes against ACC foes, but three of the 11 matches will be designated as nonconference games. The Saturday season opener against the Hokies is one of the matches deemed a nonconference game. The Wahoos open conference play on Sept. 17 at Duke. The regular season comes to a close on Nov. 1. ACC Tournament quarterfinal matches begin on Nov. 10.","533":"If the ACC has anything to say about it, the Virginia men\u2019s basketball team will enter its national title defense in 2020-21 with a spot in the NCAA Tournament locked up. Reports surfaced Wednesday morning that the league\u2019s coaches agreed to propose that the NCAA Tournament allow every eligible team to compete in the event this spring. ACC head coaches, including UVa\u2019s Tony Bennett, shared statements backing up the reports. \u201cObviously, many details still need to be worked out and considered regarding an all-inclusive NCAA Tournament, but the ACC head coaches are united in strongly pursuing this,\u201d Bennett wrote in a statement. \u201cWe feel it\u2019s a way to incentivize the regular season without mandating a total number of games. It provides options, excitement and the necessary flexibility for every D1 program to participate in the 2021 NCAA Tournament.\u201d According to Stadium\u2019s Jeff Goodman, 346 teams are currently eligible to compete in the NCAA Tournament. It\u2019s unclear how realistic the proposal\u2019s implementation is, especially given the potential COVID-19 risks associated with every Division I program playing tournament games. Potential postponements could make completing the massive tournament a major challenge. Logistical challenges exist, but Bennett believes an all-inclusive 2021 NCAA Tournament could be special for all involved. \u201cIt has the potential to be one of the best feel-good stories in college sports,\u201d Bennett wrote. \u201cUltimately, the safety of the student-athletes is paramount as we navigate through these unprecedented times and this is a way for that to best be accomplished.\u201d As of early September, the NCAA Tournament feels far away. The start of the season remains in question. Programs hope to begin playing games in November, but it\u2019s unclear what the extent of potential nonconference alterations will be from league to league. COVID-19 threatens to disrupt at least the early stages of the season. The Pac-12 announced in August that it wouldn\u2019t play any sporting events until 2021. Barring a change of plans, that league won\u2019t begin competition in November like others leagues. Uncertainty surrounding the schedule adds some clarity to the ACC\u2019s unprecedented suggestion. Without a standard schedule, allowing every team into the field reduces the potential for teams to miss out on the Big Dance due to a limited body of work. There\u2019s sound logic behind wanting every team to have a chance to play in the tournament. On the other hand, the logistics of seeding and playing a tournament with roughly 350 teams creates a massive undertaking for everyone involved. Creating a safe environment for teams to compete amid a pandemic may also be a challenge, depending on how well COVID-19 testing and treatments advance in coming months. \u201cWe are united,\u201d Louisville coach Chris Mack said in a statement. \u201cThe safety of our players is paramount. The ability to incentivize the regular season without mandating a select number of non-conference and conference games provides options and flexibility for all member institutions. As ACC head coaches, we strongly believe it\u2019s in the game\u2019s best interest to have an all-inclusive 2021 NCAA Tournament.\u201d Several other programs, including the North Carolina\u2019s men\u2019s basketball Twitter account, shared support. UNC released a graphic supporting the idea. It mentioned the event being a celebration of college basketball. While the logistics can make even the best event planner\u2019s head spin, ACC coaches believe an all-inclusive NCAA Tournament is best for the sport in 2020-21. \u201cThis is not a regular season,\u201d Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski said in a statement. \u201cIt is clearly an irregular season that will require something different. Our sport needs to be agile and creative. Most importantly, an all-inclusive postseason tournament will allow a unique and unprecedented opportunity for every team and every student athlete to compete for a national championship.\u201d","534":"The first University of Virginia athletic event of the fall has been canceled. While it wasn\u2019t slated to count in the regular-season standings, the UVa men\u2019s soccer team\u2019s Friday home exhibition with Clemson was canceled after the Tigers reported two positive COVID-19 cases within their program. The exhibition won\u2019t be made up. \u201cThe health and safety of our student-athletes comes first,\u201d Clemson head coach Mike Noonan said in a statement. \u201cWe have trained really well and our student-athletes have been committed to doing things the right way. We\u2019ve made the decision not to travel to Virginia for this exhibition, and will use the time to continue to monitor our team and try to prevent further spread. We have a tremendous amount of respect for our opponent and hope to see them down the road.\u201d Clemson and Virginia, which met in the ACC Championship Game last season, aren\u2019t scheduled to play each other during the regular season, although the two programs could square off in the ACC Tournament later this fall. With the exhibition canceled, the women\u2019s soccer team will start the fall season for Virginia athletics. The Cavaliers host Virginia Tech on Saturday night in a regular-season match. It will be considered a nonconference matchup even though it\u2019s against a conference foe. The Virginia men\u2019s soccer team is still scheduled to play an exhibition on Sept. 18. Syracuse is expected to come to Charlottesville for the match. The team\u2019s six-game regular season begins on Oct. 3 at Virginia Tech. The Wahoos, who made the national championship match last season, were picked as the ACC North Region favorite earlier this week.","535":"Virginia\u2019s 2020 season opener against Virginia Tech in Blacksburg has earned a prime-time television slot, the ACC announced Friday. The Hokies will host the Cavaliers at 7:30 p.m. on Sept. 19 in a game that will be televised nationally on ABC. ACC officials announced previously that the game would receive either the 3:30 p.m. or 7:30 p.m. time slot. Miami and Louisville will play at 3:30 p.m., with the Commonwealth Cup earning the night kickoff time. Brennan Armstrong will start his first game for the Cavaliers at quarterback in the rivalry contest. Hendon Hooker, who started against UVa last season, is expected to start the game for Virginia Tech. The two teams played a back-and-forth contest last season, with Virginia winning 39-30 in Charlottesville. The victory, which was spearheaded by 475 yards of total offense from Bryce Perkins, marked UVa\u2019s first win in the series since 2003. Virginia last won in Blacksburg in 1998, when the Wahoos erased a 22-point halftime deficit to defeat the Hokies 36-32. Ahmad Hawkins scored the game-winning touchdown on a 47-yard reception with just over two minutes left in the fourth quarter. Bronco Mendenhall\u2019s team won\u2019t have to deal with a sold-out Lane Stadium this fall due to precautions related to COVID-19. Virginia guidelines only allow a maximum of 1,000 fans per contest. Even without the same home-field advantage, the Hokies pose a stiff test. They have multiple quarterbacks with experience and several talented players on the defensive side of the football. UVa will need its A-game to pick up a prime-time win in arguably the most intriguing game of the Sept. 19 weekend.","536":"A six-month stretch without University of Virginia sports finally comes to an end Saturday. The Cavaliers\u2019 women\u2019s soccer team hosts Virginia Tech Saturday at 6 p.m. to mark the long-awaited return of UVa athletic competition. The lack of sports goes back to mid-March, when the pandemic swiftly ended the NCAA\u2019s spring athletic season. The Virginia baseball team hosted Field Trip Day on March 11 with hundreds of excited kids watching the action. The swimming and diving and men\u2019s tennis teams also competed on that day. During the baseball game, UVa announced that classes would transition online because of the pandemic. The next day, the ACC Tournament was canceled, ending the season for Tony Bennett\u2019s men\u2019s basketball team. The cancellation of spring sports followed, sending student-athletes to their respective homes across the country, unsure when they\u2019d come back to Charlottesville. In early July, athletes began returning to Grounds, but uncertainty remained as conferences across the country canceled fall seasons. \u201cPersonally, I don\u2019t think I would have told you that this was ever gonna happen,\u201d fifth-year senior soccer player Anna Sumpter said of playing a match this fall. \u201cTwo months ago, I think we were kind of in a phase where we were training, but we weren\u2019t sure exactly what we were training for and it was all on our own. It\u2019s been a really, really weird offseason. Everybody was kind of pessimistic about making it happen, but it\u2019s been amazing to see kind of how all the staff and everybody involved has done everything in their power to make it happen.\u201d Saturday\u2019s match doesn\u2019t signal a return to the way things used to be on the field, but it brings the student-athletes one step closer to athletic normalcy. COVID-19 still figures to postpone games across the athletic department. UVa announced Thursday the cancellation of a Friday men\u2019s soccer scrimmage because a pair of Clemson players tested positive for the virus. If positive cases within the student body or local community rise to a rate deemed unsafe but local health officials or university officials, there\u2019s a chance seasons could be cut short before finishing. Saturday doesn\u2019t mark the finish line for the return to regular athletic competition. On the other hand, Miami hosted a football game Thursday night against UAB to open the ACC football season. The Duke women\u2019s soccer team beat Wake Forest 4-3 Thursday night in a thrilling matchup. ACC programs are competing this fall. There\u2019s a path to playing games, and it includes being tested for COVID-19 three times a week and limited fan attendance at games. It\u2019s unusual, but the ACC believes it can work. Throughout the return to Grounds, UVa\u2019s athletic programs have worn masks during practices and followed social distancing guidelines when not competing. The effort to limit exposure to the virus has helped the athletic programs reduce positive COVID-19 cases within each team. Those efforts have Virginia in a position to return to athletic competition this fall. \u201cYou feel really happy for the players because they\u2019ve done a lot of work to get here, and a lot hasn\u2019t been on the field, it\u2019s just been doing the things they need to do to be able to be on the field,\u201d Virginia women\u2019s soccer coach Steve Swanson said. The reward for an offseason of following strict safety guidelines is an opening match at home against Virginia Tech. The game against UVa\u2019s biggest rival is technically a nonconference match, as the Cavaliers will play three games against ACC teams this season that don\u2019t count in the conference standings. Eight games will count as ACC contests. Hosting the Hokies provides a bit of added intensity in any sport, but after such a long break from athletic competition, the Cavaliers are happy to face just about anyone. \u201cIt\u2019s always a competitive and high-intensity game,\u201d Sumpter said. \u201cWith this season, though, I think we are just so excited to play against somebody other than ourselves that I don\u2019t think it would matter who we\u2019re playing.\u201d Sumpter says she didn\u2019t truly believe a fall season would happen until this week. \u201cI think it was almost a fantasy for a while,\u201d Sumpter said. Barring a last-minute postponement or cancellation, the match isn\u2019t a fantasy. UVa will host Virginia Tech on Saturday night in the first sporting event for the athletic department since March. It\u2019s been a long road, and there\u2019s still plenty of work to be done, but the Cavaliers sit on the verge of meaningful athletic competition. \u201cI think the team deserves a ton of credit for getting this far, and we\u2019re excited,\u201d Swanson said. \u201cHopefully we can bring some measure of normalcy this fall to what is an unusual year academically and sports-related wise.\u201d","537":"The Virginia athletics department reported five new positive COVID-19 cases on Friday night in its latest round of testing results. The athletic department, which specified that this will be the last report issued, also announced that all 27 of the school\u2019s athletic programs are back on Grounds. According to the release, four of the five new positive cases came from recent arrivals to Grounds. The student-athletes who tested positive will self-isolate for at least 10 days while also keeping tabs on their symptoms. If symptoms or a fever persist, the isolation period could span longer than 10 days. Close contacts of student-athletes who test positive must self-quarantine for at least two weeks. The total number of student-athletes tested for COVID-19 since testing began on July 5 is 768. For the first time, the department also announced the total number of tests administered to student-athletes. UVa has given 2,164 tests to student-athletes with 14 total positive tests. The percentage of positive tests sits below 1%. None of the 14 student-athletes who tested positive have required hospitalization. It\u2019s also worth noting that zero football players tested positive in the latest round of testing. Bronco Mendenhall\u2019s program hasn\u2019t reported a positive COVID-19 test result since July 24. The Cavaliers are scheduled to open the season on Sept. 19 against Virginia Tech. A total of 118 football players have been tested since July 5, and student-athletes have produced three positive tests since returning to Charlottesville. It\u2019s been roughly six weeks since the football program reported a positive test, though. The women\u2019s soccer program opens its season Saturday against Virginia Tech in the first UVa athletic competition since March. The soccer teams, as well as football, field hockey and volleyball will all receive three COVID-19 tests per week during their respective seasons, per ACC guidelines.","538":"Next Saturday\u2019s season-opening Commonwealth Cup has been postponed due to COVID-19 issues at Virginia Tech, both schools announced Saturday morning. No makeup date for the game, which was slated to air in prime time on ABC, was immediately given. Virginia Tech also announced that it will pause its football practices for four days to address its coronavirus issues. \u201cThe safety, as well as the physical and mental well-being of these young men and women entrusted to our care by their families remains our top priority,\u201d Virginia Tech athletic director Whit Babcock said in a statement. \u201cWhile we share the disappointment of everyone who hoped to begin the football season against our in-state rival, we remain optimistic that a full ACC football schedule can be played thanks to the flexibility the present format permits. Despite this delay, our schedule still aligns closely with the Southeastern Conference and Big 12 football timelines.\u201d Virginia will now open its season on Sept. 26 at home against Duke. The ACC announced on Saturday morning that the Cavaliers\u2019 matchup with the Blue Devils, which was originally scheduled for Nov. 14, was being moved to late September. Both teams previously had a scheduled bye week on Sept. 26, which made the move possible. The Cavaliers have had limited success with scheduled openers this season. The Wahoos were originally scheduled to open the season with Georgia in Atlanta on Labor Day, but the pandemic caused a change in plans. UVa later scheduled VMI, but the Keydets eventually opted out of a fall football season. Virginia Tech replaced VMI as the Cavaliers\u2019 season opener, but positive COVID-19 tests within the Hokies\u2019 program led to the postponement of the Commonwealth Cup. \u201cThese are very challenging times. We understand and respect the decision by Virginia Tech,\u201d Virginia director of athletics Carla Williams said in a statement. \u201cWith so much uncertainty, flexibility in scheduling becomes incredibly important. I know both teams and both fan bases were looking forward to opening the season next weekend. We\u2019ll work with the conference and Virginia Tech to reschedule.\u201d Virginia Tech is now scheduled to open the season on Sept. 26 against N.C. State at Lane Stadium. \u201cMy primary concern continues to be the well-being of the student-athletes on our football team,\u201d Virginia Tech coach Justin Fuente said in a statement. \u201cI hurt for them because I know how badly they want to compete. I also appreciate that these young men have been dealing with the same stress, uncertainty and anxiety as their fellow Virginia Tech students over the past few months as their spring semester was dramatically altered. Then they were forced to find a way to train on their own, and to their credit, they found a way to get it done.\u201d If UVa doesn\u2019t alter it schedule, it faces a stretch of 10 games in 10 weeks without any bye weeks. Without a game until Oct. 3, however, there\u2019s a possibility the Cavaliers alter their schedule to add a game on Sept. 19 or Sept. 26 to open up a bye week at some point during the season. Altering the schedule could also open up a week to play Virginia Tech later in the season. The Hokies have a bye week on Nov. 28, which is the same week the Cavaliers are scheduled to play at Florida State. The Seminoles don\u2019t have an opponent on Sept. 19. A few other minor schedule tweaks could create an open date for both the Hokies and Cavaliers to keep the annual rivalry game alive. Regardless of how the schedule may shake out in the coming days, the Wahoos won\u2019t open the season at Virginia Tech. It\u2019s challenging news for a program excited about competing in Blacksburg. The Cavaliers hoped to beat Virginia Tech on the road for the first time since 1998. It\u2019s even tougher for UVa because the Cavaliers did everything they needed to do to play in the game, but positive tests within the opposing locker room caused the postponement. The frustration within the UVa team was evident on social media Saturday morning. \u201cOur commitment, sacrifices and desire to play show up in the numbers,\u201d UVa running back Wayne Taulapapa said. \u201cUVa athletics set the standard and this family fought every day to uphold it. At the end of the day we\u2019ll control what we can control.\u201d Taulapapa remained relatively calm, while linebacker and vocal leader Charles Snowden was more pointed in his remarks. After tweeting for Virginia Tech players to stop tweeting about wanting to play and show that desire through actions, Virginia Tech wide receiver Tre Turner responded. Turner tweeted, \u201cI\u2019m ready whenever, wherever bro.\u201d \u201cNahhh y\u2019all not,\u201d Snowden replied. \u201cIf that were the case we\u2019d be seeing you in 7 days, so I\u2019m not [trying to] hear that. Get your guys to start doing the right thing.\u201d The Cavaliers announced five new COVID-19 test results within the athletic department Friday night. The football team hasn\u2019t reported a positive COVID-19 test since July 24. The program has recorded three total positive tests of the 118 student-athletes tested since players returned to Grounds on July 5.","539":"UVa will now open its season on Sept. 26 against Duke at Scott Stadium. The Cavaliers have had bad luck with scheduled openers this season, but they hope to complete the game against Duke without issue. Matchups with Georgia, VMI and Virginia Tech have all been canceled or postponed due to changes stemming from COVID-19. Duke and Virginia were originally scheduled to play on Nov. 14. Both teams had an open date on Sept. 26, which made the move possible. \u201cI appreciate the quick action taken by the ACC and the willingness of Duke University to reschedule this game,\u201d Virginia director of athletics Carla Williams said in a statement. \u201cIt was really important for the players to have the opportunity to compete given the commitment they have shown each other and the program over the last few months.\u201d The Nov. 14 date is now open for UVa. The ACC hopes to reschedule the Commonwealth Cup for later this season. Virginia Tech plays Miami on Nov. 14. The schedule change means Virginia opens the season at home, and the Cavaliers won\u2019t start the season Oct. 3 at Clemson. UVa beat Duke 48-14 last season, but fell to Clemson 62-17 in the ACC Championship Game. Brennan Armstrong\u2019s first start for UVa will come against a less prominent opponent and at home thanks to the schedule change. Armstrong takes over at quarterback for the Cavaliers after two seasons with Bryce Perkins as the starter. Virginia head coach Bronco Mendenhall boasts an impressive record against Duke during his UVa tenure. The Cavaliers are undefeated against the Blue Devils since Mendenhall took over the program. UVa is 5-0 in its past five meetings with Duke.","540":"The ACC announced football kickoff times for its Sept. 26 games on Monday, and Virginia\u2019s season opener against Duke will kick off at 4 p.m. in Scott Stadium. The game will air on the ACC Network. UVa was planning on playing Virginia Tech this weekend, but COVID-19 cases within the Hokies\u2019 football program led to a postponement. The Cavaliers will wait a week to open the season with the Blue Devils. Bronco Mendenhall\u2019s team dominated Duke a season ago, winning 48-14 in Charlottesville. UVa forced five turnovers in the victory, and the rushing attack performed well for the Wahoos. Bryce Perkins and Wayne Taulapapa combined for five touchdowns on the ground. Joe Reed, now a member of the Los Angeles Chargers, returned a kickoff 95 yards for a touchdown in the blowout. UVa led 27-0 to open the game and 48-7 late in the fourth quarter. Duke opened its 2020 fall season last weekend against Notre Dame. The Blue Devils lost 27-13, but put up a solid fight against the heavily favored Fighting Irish. Chase Brice, a transfer from Clemson, earned the starting quarterback job for Duke in the preseason. He threw for 259 yards and added a rushing touchdown in his Duke debut. While UVa won\u2019t face anyone before hosting Duke, the Blue Devils will have two games under their belt before making the trip to Charlottesville. They are set to host Boston College this Saturday at noon. Under current guidelines, fan attendance at the UVa-Duke game will be limited to 1,000 people. Those fans will be comprised of family of the coaches and student-athletes.","541":"Virginia Tech\u2019s decision not to play against rival Virginia on Sept. 19 due to the large number of athletes unavailable because of COVID-19 protocols didn\u2019t come down to a razor-thin margin or a few key players\u2019 statuses. The Hokies could not safely field a football team. \u201cIn my opinion, it wasn\u2019t even close,\u201d Virginia Tech coach Justin Fuente said. Speaking with the media Monday, two days after Tech informed the ACC and UVa it could not play the game, forcing its postponement to a date that remains to be determined, Fuente praised his team\u2019s efforts to protect itself from the virus, rebuffed criticism that the program could have still played Saturday and acknowledged he isn\u2019t certain what comes next. \u201cThis had nothing to do with competitive advantage,\u201d said Fuente. \u201cThere\u2019s no way we could walk out there and safely put our kids on the football field. That\u2019s just the facts.\u201d Virginia Tech has declined to release testing results for its athletic department, citing a questionable interpretation of FERPA, a federal privacy law. (Virginia attorney general Mark Herring\u2019s office declined to answer whether FERPA would prevent a state university from publicly revealing data including number of tests administered and number of positives results returned.) But Fuente said his program had its COVID-19 situation under control before a sudden spike following the return of students to campus last month. He Fuente said it is not believed the rise in cases within his program stemmed from a single event, like a party. \u201cWe have been really, really good all summer long and all through fall camp. I can tell you that much,\u201d said Fuente. \u201cWe were knocking it out of the park.\u201d Fuente\u2019s program is currently in a four-day pause as it hopes to limit the spread of the virus and get players back from contact tracing quarantines. He said the team will reassemble Tuesday but won\u2019t practice until Wednesday at the earliest. The Hokies open the season Sept. 26 at home against North Carolina State now. \u201cI don\u2019t know who we have back right now or who we\u2019ll have back tomorrow,\u201d Fuente said. \u201cSo trying to find a way to piece it together is where we\u2019re at right now and what it\u2019s going to look like, how long we\u2019ll know, how many practices we\u2019ll get, I\u2019ve got no clue right now.\u201d The postponement of UVa-Tech led to Virginia and Duke moving their game from November to Sept. 26. It was a decision Blue Devils coach David Cutcliffe learned of Friday night, on the eve of his team\u2019s season opener at Notre Dame. Cutcliffe decided not to tell his players and staff, not wanting to distract them from the game against the Irish. Saturday morning, he walked into the team\u2019s pre-game meal. \u201cPeople have their phones out. All their talking about is the change of the Virginia game,\u201d said Cutcliffe. \u201cI had no idea it was going to be released by the ACC. My suggestion is, we wait til Sunday to release those changes out of a respect to teams and staffs that are preparing to play a game.\u201d Hunter suspended Earlier Monday, Virginia Tech announced that safety Devon Hunter has been suspended indefinitely \u201cfor not upholding the high standards\u201d the program has for players. The 6-foot, 220-pound junior from Chesapeake was a likely starter this season, after playing in 23 games over the past three seasons. The former four-star prospect figured to take over at strong safety for Reggie Floyd, a senior on last year\u2019s team.","542":"The rookie from UVa didn\u2019t have a chance to compete in a preseason contest this year due to COVID-19, meaning his first game action in an NFL uniform came in a regular-season game. Reed and the Los Angeles Chargers opened the season on the road against the Cincinnati Bengals, and while the speedster from Virginia didn\u2019t have much of a preseason to prepare for Week 1, he showed why the Chargers drafted him. After one week of NFL games, Reed holds the longest kick return in the NFL. He returned a kickoff 46 yards, setting up the Chargers\u2019 only touchdown in a 16-13 win. \u201cI\u2019m just happy I had the opportunity,\u201d Reed said. \u201cI had a couple touchbacks; they had a couple of squibs. I told myself if I had the opportunity to take one out of the end zone, I was just gonna do my best to make an impact.\u201d He certainly made an impact, bobbing and weaving his way through defenders on the left side of the field. Reed did an excellent job seeing blocks and patiently hitting holes to turn a good return into a great return. Reed told media members Monday that the kickoff return scheme features similarities to UVa\u2019s, and he feels comfortable with what the special teams coaches want from him in the return game. When it comes to executing a kick return in the NFL compared to college, Reed says it\u2019s similar. There is one major difference, though. \u201cNot too much different, other than everybody\u2019s a lot faster,\u201d Reed said with a smile. \u201cThe holes open and close a lot faster than they do in college, so that\u2019s one thing that I noticed on my first return. It\u2019s a learning experience just to have quicker vision, quicker reaction skills.\u201d Also a wide receiver, Reed enters Week 2 still seeking his first reception. While he wasn\u2019t involved much offensively, Reed did see the field for three offensive snaps and nine special teams plays, according to numbers from Pro Football Reference. The Chargers typically rely on Keenan Allen and Mike Williams as their two top receivers, so finding consistent playing time at receiver could take a few weeks for Reed. The rookie felt a few jitters before the game, but Week 1 served as an opportunity to get a taste of what NFL action is like. \u201cI felt nervous,\u201d Reed said. \u201cIt was a mixture of being both nervous and excited, kind of a weird feeling. I think I was more excited than nervous, but I definitely felt the nerves tingling before the game, but after my first play, I was good to go.\u201d Reed took the field on punt coverage early, which helped him gain a feel for the game as the nerves slowly dissipated. While Reed still has plenty of room to improve offensively to earn more snaps, he landed on the Chargers roster in part due to his ability to impact the game on special teams. With a 46-yard kickoff return in his first return as a professional, Reed is off to a great start in his return role. \u201cI know how important special teams is to win a football game, so I just did what I could to help spark the football team,\u201d Reed said. Reed found time in the whirlwind of opening his NFL career to take a quick picture with former UVa defensive lineman and current Cincinnati Bengal Andrew Brown. A few former Virginia coaches saw the image and reached out to Reed about the picture and his Week 1 performance. Though he\u2019s 2,500 miles away from Charlottesville, Reed felt the Virginia connection when wide receivers coach Marques Hagans, head coach Bronco Mendenhall, special teams coordinator Ricky Brumfield and former UVa defensive line coach Vic S\u2019oto reached out. \u201cAndrew Brown and I took a picture together and Coach Mendenhall texted us and told us he loved us,\u201d Reed said. \u201cI heard from Coach Brumfield. I heard from Coach Hagans. I heard from Coach S\u2019oto, one of my older coaches, so I heard from quite a bit of the staff yesterday, which was very nice.\u201d With a support system behind him, Reed hopes to build on his first NFL game. When asked if teams and fans should expect more dynamic returns from Reed, he was succinct in his response. \u201cYes,\u201d Reed said confidently. \u201cThat\u2019s the standard for myself.\u201d","543":"The Virginia football team believed its season opener would come Sept. 19 at Virginia Tech. The Cavaliers were following COVID-19 protocols and working out with the expectation of a season opener in Blacksburg. When they were told the game was postponed due to circumstances outside their control \u2014 positive tests and contact tracing issues within Virginia Tech\u2019s program \u2014 the Wahoos were frustrated. \u201cI shared with them that the game was postponed because of COVID-related issues at Virginia Tech, and yeah, they didn\u2019t take it well,\u201d Virginia coach Bronco Mendenhall said on his Tuesday radio show. \u201cIt was really hard for them, especially the upperclassmen. And let\u2019s face it, no one knows how long the season is going to go. The uncertainty has already shown with games being postponed, games being canceled, games being moved around, and what they were clear and hopeful for is they would get that one in, for sure.\u201d The ACC plans to reschedule the Commonwealth Cup, but the game currently isn\u2019t on the Cavaliers\u2019 schedule. Virginia will open its season with Duke on Sept. 26, after a schedule change moved that game from Nov. 14 to Sept. 26. \u201cI appreciate the quick action taken by the ACC and the willingness of Duke University to reschedule this game,\u201d UVa director of athletics Carla Williams said in a statement. \u201cIt was really important for the players to have the opportunity to compete given the commitment they have shown each other and the program over the last few months.\u201d Sharing the news of the postponement wasn\u2019t easy for Mendenhall, in large part because of how well the team has done following COVID-19 protocols. The Cavaliers haven\u2019t reported a positive COVID-19 test since July 24. The postponement was beyond UVa\u2019s control. Virginia Tech coach Justin Fuente reached out to Mendenhall after the postponement to apologize for the situation, which left both teams disappointed at missing out on the in-state rivalry. \u201cJustin called later that day, mid-morning I think, and was really professional and we had a great conversation about the unique challenges we face,\u201d Mendenhall said. \u201cSome things we anticipated correctly, some things we underestimated, some things we overestimated. He was apologetic that they just didn\u2019t get it done or couldn\u2019t get it done for that time period or that game and we then kind of moved toward commonalities of what we\u2019re managing and this unique time.\u201d Postponing left fans, players and coaches upset, but the decision was made with the health and safety of the student-athletes in mind. The Hokies didn\u2019t have an adequate number of players available for the game, and it made sense to for Virginia Tech to pause football activities to gain a better handle on the spread of the virus within the team. Mendenhall emphasized on his radio show that he still spends much of his time during practice focused on virus protocols. He wants his team to limit potential exposure to the virus, and he\u2019s comfortable leaning on coordinators and other coaches to focus on the football preparation ahead of an upcoming season opener. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing that matters more to me than the health and safety and just how happy and well my team is,\u201d Mendenhall said. \u201cThat\u2019s first.\u201d UVa\u2019s players appear trusting of Mendenhall\u2019s recommendations, restrictions and guidelines. With zero positive cases within the program in nearly two months, Virginia\u2019s players have shown a commitment to limiting potential spread of COVID-19 within the team. Despite a handful of changes for the season opener on UVa\u2019s fall schedule, Mendenhall believes following the protocols can still lead to a safe and successful fall football season. A few minor setbacks haven\u2019t deterred the Cavaliers just yet. They\u2019re hopeful their efforts will be rewarded by safely completing the game against Duke. \u201cThat\u2019s really what my team said is, \u2018There\u2019s a difference between saying you want to play and showing you want to play,\u2019\u201d Mendenhall said. \u201cThe protocols and the numbers really bear that out, and I\u2019m not saying we\u2019re not at risk or that it couldn\u2019t happen to us because the actions of a few can really skew the numbers and have a team affected so quickly. To this point, our team has shown through diligence and the protocols, again with zero positives currently, that it can be done.\u201d","544":"While it hasn\u2019t been without bumps in the road\u00a0\u2014 UVa\u2019s game at Virginia Tech originally scheduled for this weekend was postponed\u00a0\u2014 ACC football is back. Miami opened the season with a pedestrian 31-14 victory over UAB last Thursday. The Saturday action featured an impressive Clemson team taking care of Wake Forest and yet another disappointing loss for a Florida State program desperately fighting to regain national relevancy. Week 1 rust was evident, but ACC football returned after months of uncertainty made a return seem unlikely at best. Given the remaining uncertainty surrounding the season, we\u2019re going to be flexible with our power poll. Expect significant early movement as teams adjust to the regular season following an odd offseason. 1. Clemson (1-0, 1-0 ACC, No. 1 last week) The No. 1 team in the nation is the obvious choice for the No. 1 team in our ACC power poll. Clemson beat Wake Forest 37-13, but the scoreboard doesn\u2019t accurately reflect the dominance. The Tigers led 37-3 late in the third quarter before taking their foot off the gas. Trevor Lawrence completed 22 of his 28 passes for 351 yards and a touchdown. He added another two touchdowns rushing. Next: vs. The Citadel, Saturday, 4 p.m. 2. North Carolina (1-0, 1-0 ACC, No. 3 last week) UNC looked sluggish early, holding just a 7-3 lead over Syracuse at halftime. Eventually, however the Tar Heels settled into the game. Thanks to 21 fourth-quarter points, UNC opened the season with 31-6 win over the Orange. The Tar Heels outgained Syracuse by more than 250 yards. Next: vs. Charlotte, Saturday, 3:30 p.m. 3. Notre Dame (1-0, 1-0 ACC, No. 2 last week) The Fighting Irish opened the fourth quarter with a 17-13 lead over Duke before scoring all 10 points of the final quarter. While Notre Dame won, the 27-13 victory over Duke wasn\u2019t overwhelmingly impressive. Look for Notre Dame\u2019s offense to improve as the season progresses. Next: vs. South Florida, Saturday, 2:30 p.m. 4. Virginia (0-0, No. 4 last week) UVa made headlines last weekend despite not playing a game. The headlines came from scheduling changes. The Cavaliers\u2019 scheduled game for Sept. 19 against Virginia Tech was postponed due to issues related to COVID-19 within Virginia Tech\u2019s program. New starting quarterback Brennan Armstrong is now scheduled to start his first game on Sept. 26 against Duke. Next: Bye 5. Pittsburgh (1-0, No. 7 last week) Pitt beat Austin Peay 55-0 to open its season. While a win over an FCS team doesn\u2019t mean much long term, the Panthers showed an ability to move the football in addition to playing suffocating defense. They allowed just 137 total yards in the blowout victory. Next: vs. Syracuse, Saturday, noon 6. Louisville (1-0, No. 5 last week) The Cardinals open the season 1-0 after beating Western Kentucky 35-21. Micale Cunningham threw for 343 yards and three touchdowns while averaging 10.3 yards per pass attempt and 18 yards per completion. Defense remains the question mark for Louisville. Next: vs. Miami, Saturday, 7:30 p.m. 7. Georgia Tech (1-0, 1-0 ACC, No. 15 last week) Hey, we said there would be significant early season movement in the power poll. A 16-13 road victory over Florida State pushes the Yellow Jackets to No. 7. While Georgia Tech might quickly fall back in later weeks, we\u2019ll give credit to Geoff Collins\u2019 team for beating the Seminoles on the road. Freshman quarterback Jeff Sims made a few mistakes, but played well for the Yellow Jackets. Saturday brings a major test. Next: vs. UCF, Saturday, 3:30 p.m. 8. Miami (1-0, No. 9 last week) The Hurricanes beat UAB 31-14 despite a shaky passing game. On the ground, however, the Hurricanes performed well. They racked up 337 rushing yards and three touchdowns in the victory. If tight end Brevin Jordan can establish himself as a reliable No. 1 receiving option in future weeks\u00a0\u2014 he caught three passes for 51 yards and a touchdown against UAB\u00a0\u2014 Miami\u2019s passing game may take a significant step forward. Next: at Louisville, Saturday, 7:30 p.m. 9. Virginia Tech (0-0, No. 6 last week) The Hokies have yet to take the field, but COVID-19 issues within the program forced a postponement of the Commonwealth Cup. Days later, safety and team leader Devon Hunter was suspended following an arrest. It\u2019s been a rough few days for the Hokies, who returned to practice Wednesday. Next: Bye 10. Wake Forest (0-1, 0-1 ACC, No. 8 last week) It\u2019s hard to know much about Wake Forest through one week. The Demon Deacons fell to Clemson 37-13, but Clemson is well above teams in the middle of the ACC in terms of both talent and execution levels. Saturday\u2019s contest should give more insight into the quality of Dave Clawson\u2019s team. Next: at N.C. State, Saturday, 8 p.m. 11. Duke (0-1, 0-1 ACC, No. 13 last week) The Blue Devils kept it close Saturday at Notre Dame, losing 27-13 but only trailing 17-13 after three quarters. New quarterback Chase Brice played adequately, and the defense held its own in the loss. Duke doesn\u2019t look the part of an ACC title contender, but it could finish the year with a winning record if it maintains steady play. Next: vs. Boston College, Saturday, noon 12. Boston College (0-0, No. 11 last week) The Jeff Hafley era at BC begins Saturday at Duke. Expectations are low in Year 1 for the new head coach. Improving the defense will be critical if the Eagles want to compete consistently this fall. Next: at Duke, Saturday, noon 13. N.C. State (0-0, No. 12 last week) We will get our first look at the Wolfpack on Saturday night, when they host Wake Forest. N.C. State will need improvement in every phase of the game compared to last season to be competitive. Next: vs. Wake Forest, Saturday, 8 p.m. 14. Florida State (0-1, 0-1 ACC, No. 10 last week) Florida State hosted Georgia Tech last weekend as a nearly two-touchdown favorite. Mike Norvell\u2019s group lost 16-13, struggling to muster any offensive rhythm despite jumping out to a 10-0 lead. It was a disappointing showing for the Seminoles, who start the season with a loss to a middle-of-the-road Georgia Tech squad.\u00a0Next:\u00a0Bye 15. Syracuse (0-1, 0-1 ACC, No. 14 last week) Syracuse kept the game tight with North Carolina until the final quarter. A 10-6 deficit turned into a 31-6 loss. The offense struggled all game, and the Orange were unable to slow down Sam Howell and UNC\u2019s offense for a full 60-minute contest. Next: at Pitt, Saturday, noon","545":"Part two of the Virginia men\u2019s basketball team\u2019s national title defense begins at the end of November. The NCAA announced Wednesday that Nov. 25 will serve as the starting date for the 2020-21 college basketball season. Tina Thompson and the UVa women\u2019s basketball program can also begin on Nov. 25. \u201cThe new season start date near the Thanksgiving holiday provides the optimal opportunity to successfully launch the basketball season,\u201d NCAA senior vice president of basketball Dan Gavitt said. \u201cIt is a grand compromise of sorts and a unified approach that focuses on the health and safety of student-athletes competing toward the 2021 Division I basketball championships.\u201d The UVa men\u2019s basketball team was previously scheduled to begin its season on Nov. 10 against Gardner-Webb, according to game contracts obtained by The Daily Progress. It\u2019s unclear how Virginia\u2019s schedule may shake out this fall. The Cavaliers were scheduled to play double-digit nonconference games, and four of those games were scheduled to occur prior to Nov. 25. In addition to the season opener, UVa was supposed to face Temple in Charlotte on Nov. 13. A Nov. 16 home game against Long Beach State represented the second home contest of the year, and three days later the Cavaliers were scheduled to face James Madison in Harrisonburg at the Dukes\u2019 new arena. The next game for UVa was going to come in the Wooden Legacy Classic in Los Angeles. The field included Georgetown, Kansas and UCLA. National college basketball reporter Jon Rothstein recently reported that Wooden Classic may take place in Orlando instead. It\u2019s unclear if the field would remain the same, especially given an announcement from the Pac-12 earlier this summer saying it didn\u2019t expect to allow competition until 2021. UCLA is a member of the Pac-12. While the schedule for the season remains uncertain, a few firm plans were created by the NCAA. Practices can begin on Oct. 14, marking roughly one month until the start of official practices. Prior to the start of official practices, there\u2019s a \u201ctransition period\u201d the NCAA announced Wednesday. The period starts on Sept. 21 and runs through Oct. 13. During that team strength and conditioning, sport-related meetings and skill instruction are allowed for up to 12 hours per week. Only eight of the hours can be used on skill instruction, and student-athletes must receive two days off each week. Teams are recommended to play at least four nonconference games this season. Programs will also aim to play a minimum of 13 regular season games and a maximum of 27. Virginia enters the 2020-21 season as one of the favorites to contend for a national championship. Tony Bennett\u2019s team returns Kihei Clark at point guard to go with Marquette transfer Sam Hauser at small forward and Jay Huff at center. Casey Morsell and Tomas Woldetensae add important depth at the shooting guard spot. Several other players should find time on the court for a program that won the 2018-19 national title. UVa finished the 2019-20 season on a hot streak before COVID-19 canceled the season before the Wahoos took the court for postseason action. They\u2019re hopeful the virus doesn\u2019t impact the postseason this spring.","546":"After originally being moved to the start of the season, the Virginia football team\u2019s rivalry game with Virginia Tech is returning to the end of the season. The ACC announced Thursday that the two football programs will play Dec. 12 in Blacksburg. Game time and television information are yet to be determined. The Sept. 19 game between the two programs was postponed after Virginia Tech players tested positive for COVID-19 and additional players needed to quarantine due to contact tracing protocols. UVa players were frustrated by the postponement. \u201cIt was really hard for them, especially the upperclassmen,\u201d Virginia head coach Bronco Mendenhall said on his Tuesday radio show. \u201cAnd let\u2019s face it, no one knows how long the season is going to go. The uncertainty has already shown with games being postponed, games being canceled, games being moved around, and what they were clear and hopeful for is they would get that one in, for sure.\u201d The rescheduled game gives UVa a chance to play for the Commonwealth Cup this fall. Adding the game to the schedule doesn\u2019t mean the game is certain to be played, though. North Carolina\u2019s game with Charlotte, which was scheduled for Saturday, was canceled after positive tests and contact tracing within Charlotte\u2019s program left it unable to compete. COVID-19 will likely remain an obstacle throughout the season, making every game on Virginia\u2019s schedule tentative. UVa is hopeful it can compete with the Hokies again after it won last season\u2019s matchup 39-30, picking up its first win in the rivalry in 15 seasons. The Cavaliers haven\u2019t won in Blacksburg since 1998. Barring any drastic changes, the Wahoos will likely face the Hokies in an unusual road environment. Current guidance limits attendance at UVa and Virginia Tech home football games to 1,000 people. Regardless of the restrictions, both teams will accept whatever conditions are required to complete the game safely this season.","547":"His dream moment didn\u2019t go quite as he drew it up in his head. \u201cMine didn\u2019t really turn out ideally,\u201d Waddell laughed. \u201cI called my mom, I called my dad, I called my sister, and none of the three answered.\u201d Eventually, the former Virginia pitcher reached his family. He shared calls with all three before turning his attention toward joining the Pirates and making his MLB debut. \u201cBy the time I got a hold of everybody, it was awesome,\u201d Waddell said. \u201cIt was really cool to share. They were obviously very excited, and it was just a cool moment to share. It\u2019s kind of hard to put into words.\u201d Waddell\u2019s debut came on Aug. 14 against the Cincinnati Reds. While the Pirates lost 8-1, Waddell saw his first MLB action, marking a significant moment in his professional career. His long road to the majors has included multiple seasons at the minor league level since leaving UVa in 2015. Eventually, the grind paid off. Despite the challenging road to the highest level facing professional baseball players, Waddell embraced the many seasons it took to reach the top of the game. \u201cNo matter what field it is in the world, if you have a job where you get to what you love to do every day, it\u2019s something you can\u2019t really take for granted,\u201d Waddell said. Appearing in an MLB game brings with it plenty of pressure. Waddell spent a few days with the team before appearing in a game, which he said helped him acclimate to the top level of professional baseball, but he had to wait toward the end of the Aug. 14 contest to take the field. The Pirates called his number in the seventh inning. \u201cThat phone rings, your heart gets beating a little bit faster, you start mentally getting going,\u201d Waddell said of the call to the bullpen. \u201cThat first one you gotta take some breaths.\u201d Nerves took over after Waddell realized he\u2019d take the field. He did his best to slow down to breathe and remain in the moment, but the stage, even without a packed stadium because of COVID-19, can make even the finest athletes anxious. \u201cI felt it, especially on the jog in from the pen, but when I got to the mound I kind of took a moment and looked around and took some breaths and tried be like, \u2018Alright, here we go, let\u2019s focus, it\u2019s time to get the job done,\u2019\u201d Waddell said. After he found the strike zone, Waddell managed to settle in. The left-handed pitcher tossed 1 1\/3 innings, allowing two hits and a run in his first action. He struck out two batters. \u201cFirst and foremost, it was a lot of fun,\u201d Waddell said. \u201cIt\u2019s something that you dream about your whole life and you work towards, and to be able to accomplish that is really cool.\u201d Waddell appeared again, on Aug. 20. This time, he logged two shutout innings in a 2-0 loss to Cleveland. The former UVa star has just a few innings of major league experience under his belt, but he wants to stay focused on what got him to the big leagues in the first place. He\u2019s hopeful to earn more time with the Pirates either at the end of the regular season or in future seasons. Waddell wants to continue working on his craft in hopes of becoming a regular member on the active roster. He credits his time at UVa for helping him eventually reach the major leagues and still feels a close connection to the school and coaching staff as he embarks on additional professional endeavors. Some former teammates and many coaches reached out to Waddell following his MLB debut, sharing in the moment. \u201cI grew so much as a baseball player at Virginia and with those guys the three years that I was there,\u201d Waddell said. \u201cThat coaching staff, you know, I honestly would not be the same baseball player I am today without them. To hear from all those guys and to kind of share that moment with them as well, I think it\u2019s something that\u2019s really, really special.\u201d A month after making his first MLB appearance, Waddell appreciates the moments earlier in his life that led to him fulfilling his childhood dream. \u201cIf I don\u2019t get the opportunity to play there, and that coaching staff doesn\u2019t give me that opportunity, who knows where I\u2019m at today,\u201d Waddell said. \u201cIt\u2019s a really cool event, but at the end of the day, it\u2019s really a culmination of a lot of other events that have come together.\u201d","548":"The ACC staged seven football games last week, four with fans, three without. Three contests have been rescheduled, another canceled, and the date of the league\u2019s championship game remains uncertain. No one thought sports in a pandemic would be linear. \u201cIt\u2019s been,\u201d ACC commissioner John Swofford said Friday, \u201cat least through the first week, what we would have expected. \u2026 We did anticipate that we would need to be very flexible and nimble in terms of our scheduling, and that indeed came into play before we ever played a game.\u201d Coronavirus hiccups aside, Swofford is encouraged by not only the trust among the conference\u2019s 15 schools but also protocols that entail, in some cases, private jets transporting COVID-19 tests to a Durham, North Carolina, lab for rapid processing. During our half-hour conversation, Swofford also said he anticipates the ACC scheduling a full complement of 20 men\u2019s basketball league games, plus a handful of nonconference dates. He hopes the latter includes the 22nd annual ACC-Big Ten Challenge. Before unpacking basketball further, let\u2019s dive into the present: football. The ACC announced Aug. 18 that league schools would test athletes in contact sports such as football and soccer three times per week for COVID-19, with a day-before-competition test in football administered by a third party selected by the league office. Swofford revealed Friday that MAKO Medical Laboratories is coordinating those tests. Depending on the school\u2019s location, MAKO either flies or drives the tests to Durham for processing, with results available no later than early morning of game day. These are the more expensive PCR, or molecular, tests, as opposed to antigen tests that can be processed in minutes, and the schools are paying the bill. \u201cWe\u2019ll see how the antigen tests evolve and take the advice of our medical advisory committee,\u201d Swofford said. \u201cBut right now that advice is that this is the best approach and the most dependable approach based on the quality of the tests and the availability of the tests. \u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s something that\u2019s just necessary in order to play this season. \u2026 It\u2019s a cost that\u2019s worth it in terms of protection of our players.\u201d Swofford said ACC schools have been diligent throughout the past six months not to compromise the availability of tests in their respective communities. \u201cOur schools and the conference office are comfortable that it\u2019s not taking away from any type of similar testing that\u2019s needed in any of our locales,\u201d he said. Miami, Louisville, Florida State, Notre Dame, Pittsburgh, Wake Forest and North Carolina hosted football games last week, the first four with limited attendance, the latter three without spectators, decisions based on local protocols. Chaired by Cameron Wolfe, an infectious disease expert at Duke, the ACC medical advisory group has not detected any virus spread from competition or practice, Swofford said. But infections among the student bodies at Virginia Tech and North Carolina State spilled into the football programs, forcing the postponement first of N.C. State\u2019s game at Tech and later the Hokies\u2019 contest versus Virginia. The Cavaliers\u2019 Nov. 14 date with Duke then was moved to next week to avoid UVa having consecutive open dates. Also, North Carolina\u2019s nonconference game versus Charlotte, scheduled for Saturday, was canceled Thursday because the 49ers have too many offensive linemen quarantined. Based on the input of coaches and the medical advisory panel, the ACC has not adopted an overall roster minimum for football competition but does recommend having at least seven scholarship offensive linemen available. Virginia Tech\u2019s Justin Fuente and UVa\u2019s Bronco Mendenhall supported the flexible guidelines. \u201cI think that says good things about the culture of the league and trust factor in the league,\u201d Swofford said. \u201cThe communication flow has just been outstanding through all of [the postponements]. We went into the year emphasizing, look, this is going to be different than anything we\u2019ve ever experienced and there\u2019s going to need to be trust among the institutions. There\u2019s going to need to be empathy. There can be a problem at any institution at any time. \u201cI hate that one school, in this instance Virginia Tech, has been affected twice right out of the gate.\u201d Though the Commonwealth Cup game has been rescheduled for Dec. 12, the ACC title contest remains an either\/or of Dec. 12 or Dec. 19. Swofford said the conference is engaged with its bowl partners to determine what postseason might resemble. The NCAA Division I Council this week recommended that the men\u2019s basketball season start Nov. 25, the day after Thanksgiving. Moreover, the NCAA hopes to play its championship tournament as scheduled, in March and April. ACC coaches unanimously and publicly lobbied for this season\u2019s NCAA Tournament to include all 346 eligible teams, rather than the standard 68. But the logistics, especially during a pandemic, were untenable. \u201cUnfortunately we didn\u2019t get much buy-in from our colleagues [nationally] on that,\u201d Swofford said. \u201cBut I think it was certainly something worth considering and could have worked well given the extreme nature of what we\u2019re dealing with this year.\u201d With the NCAA basketball decisions in hand, a six-member ACC subcommittee, armed with the conference\u2019s lessons from planning for football and fall Olympic sports, is working on schedule recommendations to forward to the league\u2019s athletic directors. The subcommittee includes three coaches (Virginia\u2019s Tony Bennett, Duke\u2019s Mike Krzyzewski and N.C. State\u2019s Kevin Keatts) and three ADs (North Carolina\u2019s Bubba Cunningham, Notre Dame\u2019s Jack Swarbrick and Louisville\u2019s Vince Tyra). Swofford does not anticipate an NBA-like bubble for college basketball but does expect the disruptions that have already affected football. \u201cI think that\u2019s what we\u2019re all trying to find,\u201d Swofford said. \u201cWhere\u2019s the sweet spot, whether it\u2019s in sports or other aspects of life?\u201d","549":"The University of Virginia athletics department announced a COVID-19 testing update Monday, sharing that there were 22 positive tests out of the 703 tests administered to student-athletes and staff members last week. That\u2019s a positivity rate of 3.1%. UVa did not specify which sports the positive tests came from. Head football coach Bronco Mendenhall shared Monday that none of those positives come from within Virginia\u2019s football team. \u201cI was calculating today, I think my team has been back 12 weeks,\u201d Mendenhall said. \u201cWe\u2019re anxious to play football, and they have done an absolutely remarkable job of managing the virus. As of today, we still have zero positive tests within our team, and that\u2019s an amazing accomplishment by them and I\u2019m looking forward to helping them play football now in a real game.\u201d The Cavaliers are scheduled to play Duke on Saturday. Several previously scheduled season openers for the football team were postponed or canceled due to COVID-19. Fortunately, limited positive test results within UVa\u2019s program leave it in a position to face the Blue Devils this weekend. The football players will be tested three times this week, with the first tests coming Monday. The other tests come Wednesday and Friday, per ACC guidelines. The results of the Monday tests were not included in the Monday release by UVa. UVa\u2019s football program hasn\u2019t reported a positive COVID-19 test since July 24. Since the football team returned on July 5, UVa athletics has conducted 3,805 total COVID-19 tests. Of those 3,805 tests, 42 were positive. That\u2019s a positivity rate of 1.1% across the entire athletic department. Those who test positive self-isolate for a minimum of 10 days. Close contacts of those who test positive self-quarantine for a minimum of 14 days. Mendenhall praised the football team\u2019s commitment to following virus protocols during Monday\u2019s press conference. In addition to wearing masks, washing hands and practicing social distancing, Mendenhall says he\u2019s implemented additional measures to reduce potential exposure or contact tracing woes. UVa changed how it huddles offensively to place some offensive linemen apart from each other to help limit the amount of direct contact they share with each other during practices. Mendenhall also uses an air horn to direct practice. Every 10 minutes, he blows the horn twice and players stretch out their arms to separate from each other and ensure good distancing at that moment. Senior linebacker Charles Snowden echoed Mendenhall\u2019s comments about following protocols, while also admitting that even when student-athletes follow protocols well there\u2019s still a chance of exposure that leads to positive tests. \u201cThis virus is really unpredictable,\u201d Snowden said. \u201cI mean, sometimes it\u2019s better to be lucky than good. I don\u2019t know if we\u2019ve been any better or worse than other programs, but I\u2019m just really proud of my guys for following those protocols.\u201d","550":"Bronco Mendenhall\u2019s first weekly press conference of the 2020 fall football season featured a familiar style, but Mendenhall took the call via Zoom. Reporters joined virtually as Mendenhall distanced himself from those nearby to safely speak with the media amid a pandemic. While this fall season features plenty of unusual occurrences due to COVID-19, the Cavaliers are scheduled to open their season Saturday against Duke. They hope this game can actually happen after seeing several season openers canceled or postponed due to COVID-19. \u201cIt\u2019s been a challenge,\u201d Mendenhall said. \u201cThe simplest narrative is probably of the boy who cried wolf, and the players I think realize now that we\u2019ve made it to a Monday of game week that this one is real.\u201d A real game means a real opponent. Even though the Cavaliers have yet to compete this fall, the Blue Devils are 0-2 overall and in the ACC after a pair of games to open their season. After a subpar offensive season in 2019, Duke head coach David Cutcliffe decided to take play calling duties this fall. It\u2019s the first time the offensive mind has called plays since 2007. \u201cDavid Cutcliffe is a master teacher and a master football coach,\u201d Mendenhall said. \u201cHe maximizes his resources every year and is innovative and his teams execute well and are just so disciplined and they play hard.\u201d Unfortunately for the Blue Devils, Cutcliffe\u2019s offensive genius has yet to translate to the field this season. Duke opened the season with a 27-13 loss to Notre Dame before falling 26-6 to Boston College in Week 2. The offense showed improvements in Week 2, but five turnovers cost Duke from turning yardage into points. The Blue Devils also missed a field goal in the loss. Duke\u2019s new quarterback \u2014 Clemson transfer Chase Brice \u2014 has shown flashes through two games, but the offense has yet to find a consistent rhythm. Defensively, however, the Blue Devils feature a solid group with an impressive defensive line. There\u2019s also some talent within the secondary. \u201cThey\u2019ve got a good team,\u201d Virginia senior wide receiver Terrell Jana said. \u201cThey fly around a little bit \u2026 their DBs are pretty good, but I think our game plan against them is pretty good.\u201d Duke is better than its record indicates, but few expect the Blue Devils to finish in the top half of the ACC. Depth chart released Virginia\u2019s depth chart, which was released Monday, wasn\u2019t too surprising, with many of the starters matching up with last year\u2019s Orange Bowl starting lineup. One big change will be a quarterback, where Brennan Armstrong will start, with Lindell Stone, Keytaon Thompson and Iraken Armstead all potentially seeing the field should Armstrong go down with injury. At running back, Wayne Taulapapa earns the starting nod. Shane Simpson and Perris Jones are listed as backups. The Cavaliers are still hopeful that Indiana transfer Ronnie Walker Jr. will have his waiver approved by the NCAA in the final appeal process. \u201cOur administration is literally checking with the NCAA every day,\u201d Mendenhall said. \u201cThat will continue until we get a final answer, and hopefully a reasonable and accurate answer this time.\u201d Along the offensive line, Bobby Haskins is still battling an injury. Mendenhall hopes he\u2019ll be available for the Clemson game, but doesn\u2019t expect him to be ready this week. The same applies to linebacker Rob Snyder. Additionally, Penn State transfer Alex Gellerstedt decided to opt out of the 2020 fall season within the past week. The offensive lineman missed all of last season with an injury suffered during preseason camp. He\u2019s yet to play a game for UVa. On special teams, Nash Griffin and Brian Delaney are listed as co-starters at punter. Delaney is the team\u2019s placekicker, and he hopes to earn the starting punter gig this season as well. Billy Kemp IV earns the nod as the starting punt returner. Interestingly, James Madison transfer D\u2019Angelo Amos is not on the three-deep at punt returner. Amos, also listed as a backup safety, was one of the best punt returners at the FCS level. Tavares Kelly Jr. is listed as the team\u2019s starting kickoff returner. Shane Simpson is also included on the two deep. Defensively, there were no surprises. Only two underclassmen \u2014 sophomore defensive tackle Jowon Briggs and sophomore linebacker Nick Jackson \u2014 are expected to start on the defensive side of the ball. Clemson kickoff set UVa\u2019s focus is set on Duke for this week. Next week, the Cavaliers face arguably the best team in the country this season. Virginia travels to Clemson on Oct. 3 for a rematch of last season\u2019s ACC Championship Game. The ACC announced Monday that the game will kick off at 8 p.m., and it will air on the ACC Network. Sorry, Comcast subscribers.","551":"Barring yet another postponement or cancellation for the Cavaliers, they host Duke on Saturday afternoon as Brennan Armstrong earns his first start as Virginia\u2019s quarterback. After this weekend, assuming Virginia Tech can actually take the field safely Saturday despite not having a full roster of players available due to positive COVID-19 tests and contact tracing, every ACC squad will have completed a regular season game. Positive COVID-19 tests led to the postponement of this weekend\u2019s Notre Dame-Wake Forest game, however, reminding ACC fans that every game is tentatively scheduled this fall. If UVa and Virginia Tech suit up this weekend, the ACC Power Poll will at least have a data point from every squad to accurately rate teams. Even with the data points piling up the ACC Power Poll ranking committee\u00a0\u2014 me\u00a0\u2014 loves to keep readers on their toes. Unfortunately for those who aren\u2019t Clemson fans, we haven\u2019t had a chance to create much drama at the top of the poll. The middle and bottom, however, feature plenty of movement this week after an exciting weekend of ACC football. 1. Clemson (2-0, 1-0 ACC, No. 1 last week) The Tigers dispatched the Citadel 49-0 for an easy September victory. Most FCS teams struggle with Power 5 competition, and Clemson isn\u2019t an ordinary Power 5 foe. Dabo Swinney\u2019s team cruised to its seven-touchdown victory, with backup quarterback D.J. Uiagalelei showing a glimpse to the future with 75 passing yards and a pair of rushing touchdowns in relief of Trevor Lawrence. Next: Bye 2. Notre Dame (2-0, 1-0 ACC, No. 3 last week) The Fighting Irish return to No. 2 in the poll after a dominant Week 2 win over South Florida. Brian Kelly\u2019s squad racked up 429 yards of offense in a 52-0 victory. Notre Dame ran for six touchdowns, as quarterback Ian Book accounted for three of those six touchdowns. The only downside comes from positive COVID-19 tests within the program, postponing this week\u2019s game against Wake Forest. Next: Bye 3. North Carolina (1-0, 1-0 ACC, No. 2 last week) UNC\u2019s game against Charlotte was canceled after positive COVID-19 tests within Charlotte\u2019s program. Unfortunately, the Tar Heels won\u2019t take the field again until October. Next: Bye 4. Miami (2-0, 1-0 ACC, No. 8 last week) All offseason analysts and experts sung Louisville\u2019s praises. Well, the Cardinals were no match for the Hurricanes on Saturday. D\u2019Eriq King threw for 325 yards and three touchdowns to pace Miami\u2019s offense in a 47-34 road win. Tight end Brevin Jordan hauled in seven receptions for 120 yards and a touchdown in the impressive offensive showing. While \u201cThe U\u201d isn\u2019t quite back, the victory is a good start for a program seeking to regain national prominence. Next: vs. Florida State, Saturday, 7:30 p.m. 5. Virginia (0-0, 0-0 ACC, No. 4 last week) Fingers crossed that Duke and Virginia remain safe this week. Bronco Mendenhall\u2019s group is excited to play its first game of the season Saturday, and it seems like that\u2019s finally going to happen after a few postponements and cancellations outside UVa\u2019s control. Expect early jitters and rust from the Wahoos, but the Cavaliers may surprise ACC pundits this fall. Brennan Armstrong is a capable quarterback, and UVa\u2019s defense has the potential to be excellent. Next: vs. Duke, Saturday, 4 p.m. 6. Pittsburgh (2-0, 1-0 ACC, No. 5 last week) Pitt\u2019s defense is good. That\u2019s not an issue for the Panthers, but the offense remains a work in progress. The Panthers beat Syracuse 21-10 behind a solid defensive showing, but Pitt missed three field goals and turned the ball over twice in a rather pedestrian offensive outing against a weak Syracuse squad. Pitt holds the potential to make the ACC Championship Game, but the offense needs to perform much better. Next: vs. Louisville, Saturday, noon 7. Louisville (1-1, 0-1 ACC, No. 6 last week) Louisville scored 34 points against Miami, but failed to consistently stop the Hurricanes\u2019 offense. The Cardinals fell 47-34 in a disappointing home loss. While Louisville\u2019s offense possesses plenty of firepower, poor defensive showings may hold the Cardinals back from the top of the ACC standings. Next: at Pitt, Saturday, noon 8. Boston College (1-0, 1-0 ACC, No. 12 last week) An impressive showing against Duke opened the Jeff Hafley era at Boston College. The Eagles beat the Blue Devils 26-6 in a game determine largely by turnovers. Duke committed five turnovers, while Boston College gave the ball away just once. Next: vs. Texas State, Saturday, 6 p.m. 9. Virginia Tech (0-0, 0-0 ACC, No. 9 last week) Head coach Justin Fuente told the media earlier this week that Virginia Tech won\u2019t have a full roster Saturday against N.C. State, and he hopes the Hokies can play. There\u2019s a chance the Hokies don\u2019t take the field for a game until October. It\u2019s hard to know what to expect when Virginia Tech does suit up, especially if it\u2019s missing key players. Next: vs. N.C. State, Saturday, 8 p.m. 10. N.C. State (1-0, 1-0 ACC, No. 13 last week) The Wolfpack matched their ACC win total from a season ago with a 45-42 triumph over Wake Forest. Three N.C. State players rushed for over 50 yards with all three doing so in 14 or fewer carries. As a team, N.C. State racked up 270 yards on the ground in the three-point victory. Next: at Virginia Tech, Saturday, 8 p.m. 11. Georgia Tech (1-1, 1-0 ACC, No. 7 last week) Well, Georgia Tech\u2019s stint in the top 10 of the power poll was fun while it lasted. Despite opening the game with a touchdown and earning a quick 7-0 lead, Georgia Tech fell 49-21 to UCF. There\u2019s no shame in losing to UCF, but the Yellow Jackets looked abysmal defensively, allowing 660 yards. Next: at Syracuse, Saturday, noon 12. Wake Forest (0-2, 0-2 ACC, No. 10 last week) The Demon Deacons couldn\u2019t stop the run in a 45-42 loss to N.C. State. Opening with Clemson put Wake Forest in a hole to start the season. A loss to the Wolfpack makes the hole even deeper. Next: Bye 13. Florida State (0-1, 0-1 ACC, No. 14 last week) After a week off, Florida State returns to action against an undefeated Miami squad. The Hurricanes should provide a stiff test for Mike Norvell\u2019s team, which lost its opening game to Georgia Tech. Next: at Miami, Saturday, 7:30 p.m. 14. Duke (0-2, 0-2 ACC, No. 11 last week) Through two games, Duke has scored a total of 19 points. That won\u2019t cut it in any league, especially not the ACC. Five turnovers doomed the Blue Devils in a 26-6 loss to Boston College. They need to take care of the football to have a shot to beat UVa this Saturday. Next: at Virginia, Saturday, 4 p.m. 15. Syracuse (0-2, 0-2 ACC, No. 15 last week) If you thought Duke\u2019s offensive output was lame, Syracuse will make you cringe. It\u2019s up to just 16 points scored through two games. The Orange fought hard against Pitt, only losing 21-10, but the offense never came. Unfortunately for Syracuse, there\u2019s little reason for optimism moving forward. Syracuse simply isn\u2019t a quality ACC team this fall. Next: vs. Georgia Tech, Saturday, noon","552":"Defense carried the Virginia football team during the early portion of last season. The Cavaliers opened 2019 with a gritty 30-14 win over Pittsburgh, which included a pair of interceptions and a second-half shutout. The defense held strong in a tough October loss to Miami, which also marked the game cornerback Bryce Hall saw his senior season end due to injury. Injuries, like the one suffered by Hall, played a critical role in the decline of UVa\u2019s defensive unit, which dipped dramatically late in the season. As inexperienced players took the field, opposing offenses took advantage. In the first eight games of the 2019 season, Virginia allowed an average of 281.5 yards per game. If the Cavaliers maintained that average all season, they would\u2019ve ranked fourth nationally in yards per game allowed. The final six games of the season didn\u2019t go nearly as well. Against better competition and with UVa reeling from injuries, the defense allowed an average of 492.3 yards per game. If UVa maintained that measure all season, the Cavaliers would\u2019ve ranked second-to-last nationally in yards allowed per game. Virginia started the season as one of the best defenses in the country before ending the year as one of the nation\u2019s worst units, at least statistically. For the first seven games of the 2019 season, no Virginia opponent reached 350 total yards. Each of the team\u2019s last seven foes surpassed that mark. \u201cThe expectation is for them to be better than last year\u2019s defense from Game 1 all the way through Game 13 or Game 14 or however many \u2014 12 \u2014 whatever the season calls for this year, as many as we can possibly play,\u201d head coach Bronco Mendenhall said. \u201cLast year, we started very strong and through about Game 7 I think [the defense] really carried our team. Our offense caught up and then when the defense, especially the secondary, was depleted, our offense kind of took over and became the team\u2019s identity down the stretch.\u201d Bryce Perkins and UVa\u2019s offense bailed out the defense toward the end of last season, but the offensive efforts weren\u2019t enough against Clemson or in the team\u2019s Orange Bowl defeat against Florida. Virginia allowed a combined 98 points in its final two games of the season. Entering this fall, the most recent on-field memories of UVa\u2019s defense fill players and coaches with anger and frustration. \u201cWe have a bad taste in our mouth right now,\u201d co-defensive coordinator Nick Howell said this spring. Fortunately for Virginia, the team returns an abundance of defensive experience. Richard Burney, Jowon Briggs and Mandy Alonso start on the defensive line. All three played critical roles last season, with Briggs being one of two sophomores expected to start on defense this season. At linebacker, Charles Snowden headlines a veteran group that also includes Zane Zandier and Noah Taylor. Sophomore Nick Jackson earns a starting nod entering Week 1. The secondary, which struggled last season, returns a healthy group of contributors. Nick Grant and De\u2019Vante Cross will start at cornerback, while Brenton Nelson and Joey Blount take safety roles. Of the 11 starters on Virginia\u2019s defense, nine are upperclassmen. \u201cI know we have the talent, and I know we have the want to, now it\u2019s just kind of going out and doing it,\u201d Snowden said. Given the risk of players missing time for COVID-19 in addition to regular injuries, depth takes added importance this fall. Two James Madison transfers add important depth at key positions. Aaron Faumui isn\u2019t with the team this fall, leaving them in need of defensive line help. Adeeb Atariwa, a graduate transfer from JMU, is expected to see time in his place. D\u2019Angelo Amos, a safety from JMU, is listed as the primary backup to Blount in the secondary. Should injuries pop up, it wouldn\u2019t be a surprise to see Amos earn more snaps as the season progresses. Other returners defensively include cornerbacks Darrius Bratton and Heskin Smith. Ben Smiley III is a redshirt freshman defensive end who teammates and coaches compliment regularly. At linebacker, Matt Gahm, Elliott Brown and Josh Ahern are among the group of key returners. Rob Snyder won\u2019t be available for Week 1, but the linebacker should work into the rotation later in the season. \u201cIt definitely puts fire on us because right now we\u2019re all healthy and we\u2019re all ready to play, and it hasn\u2019t been like that in a while,\u201d Alonso said. \u201cIt feels good to have the group all together and intact right now, and we\u2019re looking forward to playing together on the field.\u201d On paper, there\u2019s potential for Virginia\u2019s defense to perform like it did at the beginning of last season, when it helped the Cavaliers win games. If the defense can become an elite ACC squad, it will take pressure off new quarterback Brennan Armstrong and Virginia\u2019s offense. Mendenhall\u2019s group wants to be more consistent this fall, and it has the pieces to achieve that goal. \u201cI think the defensive players are anxious to reestablish what they can play like with a full and healthy roster,\u201d Mendenhall said.","553":"The Virginia women\u2019s soccer team opened the fall athletic season on Sept. 12, playing the school\u2019s first competition in months. The Cavaliers beat Virginia Tech 3-1 in front of a small crowd that included family of players and coaches because of COVID-19 restrictions. Also in the crowd, however, was a boisterous group of about 10 guys standing along the fence at the far side of the field. Throughout the 90-minute match, the guys screamed and chanted in support of the Wahoos. Everyone, from players to other fans, took note of the rowdy bunch. Six days later, the group returned. This time, they appeared in Memorial Gym, shouting loudly as the UVa volleyball team beat The Citadel 3-0. Saturday, those same fans take the field at Scott Stadium for their first game of the season. \u201cSmall in numbers, but mighty in energy,\u201d senior linebacker Charles Snowden said. \u201cWe just try to replicate as many people as we can; kind of make up for those lack of numbers.\u201d Snowden is among the group of Virginia football players to attend the Olympic sporting events, hoping to support his peers during an unusual fall season. With fans not allowed, Snowden and company wanted to ensure their athletic peers opened their seasons with a home-field advantage. They also wanted something to do. \u201cWe\u2019re all going through the same thing,\u201d senior wide receiver Terrell Jana said. \u201cWe all have been here for however long away from everybody else, on Zoom calls for class, on Zoom calls for meetings. We know the impact our presence can have in a game, but also just for us, we\u2019re not doing anything. All we\u2019re doing is football and Zoom right now, so [when] we can go watch some of our friends play a game it\u2019s always fun for us.\u201d Few activities beat watching live sports, and the football players took advantage of the chance to watch the two games held in Charlottesville this fall. Men\u2019s basketball players, including Kihei Clark and Sam Hauser were also in attendance at the volleyball match. The athletes sat in the same section of the bleachers as the football players, becoming increasingly noticeable as the match progressed. \u201cI think we were surprised,\u201d senior volleyball player Sarah Billiard said of the crowd noise. \u201cWe were not expecting to have a big, loud atmosphere. They really surprised us, and I think it gave us a boost. It was exciting to have people there. It definitely makes a difference.\u201d Seeing student-athletes support each other isn\u2019t a surprise. Athletes typically attend other sporting events throughout the semester, cheering on their peers. This fall feels different, though. For months, athletes of various fall sports wondered if they\u2019d ever take the field for games. With the pandemic postponing and canceling games daily, uncertainty still surrounds the fall season. The football program lost out on potential season openers with Georgia, VMI and Virginia Tech. The Cavaliers hope they\u2019re able to face Duke this Saturday for their first game of the year. Tuesday night, UVa announced plans to increase restrictions on students for a two-week span to help control the spread of the virus within the campus community. The pandemic is a daily concern for students and student-athletes. Struggling and sacrificing to make it to a fall season is something all of UVa\u2019s student-athletes can appreciate. \u201cWith all the uncertainty and anxiety surrounding our respective seasons, it\u2019s almost like all the student-athletes have bonded over the chaos,\u201d women\u2019s soccer player Rebecca Jarrett said. \u201cIn a normal year, it\u2019s sweet to see other teams at games, but right now it\u2019s just that little bit sweeter.\u201d The women\u2019s soccer team noticed the football players at their season opener, appreciating the gesture because it served as an acknowledgement of the journey to reach competition safely. \u201cWhen other student-athletes are cheering at the top of their lungs for 90 straight minutes, as the football team so enthusiastically did at our first home game, it\u2019s like they\u2019re excited to be watching the game but also proud of us for making it out on the field,\u201d Jarrett said, \u201cbecause, at some point, we didn\u2019t think we\u2019d ever be able to.\u201d","554":"If you wandered by Virginia football practice this fall, you might hear players screaming and chanting. In addition to the typical support offered to their teammates, players on the bench were asked to bring increased energy to hype up their playing partners. In essence, they tried to simulate a potential 2020 game-day atmosphere during practice. Head coach Bronco Mendenhall calls this, an active and positive sideline, the \u201cFourth Side.\u201d In addition to offense, defense and special teams, Mendenhall wants players on the bench engaged and supportive throughout each game. The term is part of building a culture within a program that went 2-10 his first season with an abysmal opening performance against Richmond. Over the years, the Fourth Side has grown to include fans in the stands. The culture-building technique may play an important role this season, with UVa opening its season Saturday in front of a maximum crowd of 1,000 people due to COVID-19 restrictions. \u201cIt would be remarkable and timely if that ended up being a competitive advantage for us this season,\u201d Mendenhall said. \u201cWe have trained for it. It is emphasized, but it is a new team, and there are new players on that side. It\u2019s a culture that\u2019s unique to the program meaning that it\u2019s been in place, but this year\u2019s team has a new version and a new challenge to take on.\u201d With roughly 50,000 fewer fans than the Cavaliers might have drawn in for a typical season opener, the game atmosphere will feel different for the players and coaches. Mendenhall says some of his coaching colleagues at other schools compared recent games to scrimmages. He also says more of the on-field dialogue is audible. He shared some concern in a recent media session about cursing and trash talk potentially being heard. He expects to keep tabs of how the first game goes before coaching the Fourth Side more next week. The Richmond Times-Dispatch reported earlier this offseason that ACC teams are allowed to use artificial crowd noise to help simulate a traditional game-day experience. Even with crowd noise or music being played, artificial sound isn\u2019t the same as die-hard fans screaming with joy. That\u2019s part of the reason Mendenhall believes the Fourth Side could prove critical this year. Throughout camp, players have practiced being engaged on the sidelines. \u201cDuring fall camp, coach has really harped on everyone on the sidelines getting into whoever\u2019s on the field and really cheering on our teammates,\u201d senior defensive lineman Mandy Alonso said. \u201cThat\u2019s what feeds our Fourth Side. We practice using our Fourth Side in practice, so I feel like we\u2019re gonna be able to feed off each other.\u201d The experience isn\u2019t just different for players, however, it\u2019s also different for the fans who plan their fall Saturdays around trips to Scott Stadium to watch the Wahoos. Natalie Fitzgerald, UVa\u2019s former director of academic affairs for football, has had a member of her family attend home football games dating back to their first purchase of season tickets in 2005. The 15-year streak of home attendance comes to an end this Saturday. It\u2019s a bittersweet feeling for Fitzgerald, who retired from her role at UVa in the winter of 2019 after beginning in 2006. She\u2019s looking forward to avoiding the occasional obnoxious fan, but she\u2019s also planned tailgates with her family and the families of football players for years. She won\u2019t see those families at tailgates or in the stands this weekend, even though some of them will be allowed into the stadium as part of the 1,000 fan maximum. \u201cYou just cannot understand how heartbroken I am that I\u2019m not gonna be in Scott, but Saturday is perfect for me because honestly it will be my husband and I only,\u201d Fitzgerald said. \u201cWe will be on our couches in our living room. We\u2019ve already got our tailgate menu planned out. We\u2019re ready to go and it will be perfect for me because I won\u2019t be around anybody else that is coaching from seat 10 or row 12 or thinks they can do a better job. I will just be able to watch the team play and bring home a win and tell my husband every now and then that he needs to be quiet.\u201d Despite the deep disappointment of not seeing her football family this fall, Fitzgerald is choosing to look at the positives. She understands that her staying home helps keep the football players safe, as a full stadium would pose a health risk to them and others in the community. She desperately wants to see UVa play to showcase that the team is better than pundits give it credit for entering this fall. She hopes to see the Cavaliers compete again for the ACC title. She also recognizes that watching from home to ensure proper safety is a sacrifice she and other fans are ready to make. \u201cYou worry about the safety of the players, first and foremost,\u201d Fitzgerald said. \u201cAm I in a place where I\u2019m missing college football? Absolutely. Am I struggling to find things to watch on the weekends? Absolutely, but at no time do I want to put anybody at risk to enjoy a college football game.\u201d Limited fan attendance is one of the major storylines for football games this fall. Even without passionate fans like Fitzgerald, though, games count in the standings. There\u2019s a championship on the line later this season. Embracing the unusual circumstances is an important part of finding success this season. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely gonna be a strange feeling, but I feel like it\u2019s probably gonna be kind of like our spring games where it\u2019s usually just friends and family and a few fans,\u201d Alonso said. Accepting a lack of fans and focusing on internal support within the team could prove vital to the team\u2019s ability to gain momentum and stay positive during games this fall. In terms of competing without thousands of screaming fans at Scott Stadium, wide receiver Terrell Jana might be the most ready of any UVa player to suit up in front of small live audiences. \u201cI grew up playing football in Canada, so I\u2019m used to having no fans at my games,\u201d Jana said.","555":"The Virginia field hockey team opened the 2020 season with a 2-1 loss to Wake Forest on Saturday at the UVa Turf Field. The loss does not count in the conference standings for the Cavaliers. Virginia (0-1) took an early 1-0 lead, but Wake Forest (1-1) scored two goals in the second half to pick up the victory. The Cavaliers got on the scoreboard early, when sophomore midfielder Adele Iacobucci deflected in a shot from junior back Amber Ezechiels after a corner just 3:31 into the game. After its initial goal, Virginia had two other first-half shots make it into the corner of the net, including a bullet from freshman midfielder Anneloes Knol, but both goals were whistled off by the officials. \u201cIt was a really good game,\u201d Virginia coach Michele Madison said. \u201cI thought in the first half we were able to come out and establish our passing game and put some pressure on the goal. To have two goals called back, we just didn\u2019t respond. We didn\u2019t rebound from that. It could have been a different game if one of those goals had gone in.\u201d Wake Forest tied the game in the third quarter on an Eleanor Winants goal. Four minutes into the fourth quarter, the Demon Deacons fired off a flurry of shots at sophomore goalkeeper Taylor Henriksen with the fourth attempt making it in to give Wake Forest the lead for good. \u201cI thought Wake Forest owned the second half,\u201d Madison said. \u201cThey were able to beat our press, especially in the fourth quarter. We have some tape to look at to figure it out.\u201d Despite the season-opening loss, Madison was grateful for the chance to be on the field again with her team after an offseason of uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. \u201cIt was amazing to be out on the field playing today,\u201d Madison said. \u201cI was waiting for that whistle to blow. And that whistle blew and it was awesome. And it was awesome to compete against another opponent.\u201d The two teams play again Sunday at noon, with that match counting in the ACC standings. The match will be televised on the ACC Network.","556":"Watching the first quarter Saturday, it was evident the Virginia football team hadn\u2019t played a game in 10 months. The Cavaliers fumbled the opening kickoff, snapped the ball when quarterback Brennan Armstrong wasn\u2019t looking and gave up a 55-yard passing touchdown. By the end of the game, however, UVa fans saw flashes of the team that made the ACC Championship Game a season ago. After the first quarter, the Wahoos settled into their 2020 season opener and took care of Duke, 38-20, thanks to a spark from a freshman and seven forced turnovers. \u201cThat game was in the balance for a long, long time, and those turnovers really were the difference,\u201d Virginia coach Bronco Mendenhall said. \u201cThose are forced and those are plays made, not just miscues by the opponents\u2019 offense. That was the difference in the game, in my opinion.\u201d Freshman wide receiver Lavel Davis Jr.\u2019s two touchdowns helped propel Virginia (1-0, 1-0 ACC) past Chase Brice and Duke (0-3, 0-3 ACC). Brice tossed four interceptions, and wide receiver Jalon Calhoun added one of his own on a trick play. Between bursts of efficient offense and a steady diet of turnovers, UVa opened its season with a win. Early in the action, Virginia\u2019s limited crowd fell hushed after Tavares Kelly Jr. fumbled the opening kickoff. A swarm of Blue Devils met him at the 20 and ripped the ball loose, sending a shock through the Cavaliers\u2019 sideline. Fortunately for the Wahoos, Mandy Alonso blew up a third-and-goal carry to limit Duke to a field goal. The defense settled in well the rest of the quarter, but Armstrong and the Virginia offense looked shaky to open the game. With both offenses sputtering, Duke struck on a defensive miscue. A pair of UVa defenders attempted to jump a pass to tight end Jake Marwede late in the first quarter. They missed, allowing Marwede to grab the pass and run down the middle of the field for a 55-yard touchdown reception. Once the game turned to the second quarter, Virginia found a groove. Offensive coordinator Robert Anae leaned on the rushing attack, giving the ball to Wayne Taulapapa and Armstrong. Armstrong ran for 29 yards and a touchdown, which came from four yards out, on the opening drive of the second quarter. The power run pulled UVa within 10-7. A quick Duke three-and-out put Virginia near midfield down three. Taulapapa finished the drive, which was aided by a Duke personal foul, with three consecutive carries for 23 yards. He capped it off with a one-yard touchdown run. UVa added a Brian Delaney field goal to take a 17-10 lead into halftime. Unfortunately for Armstrong and the Cavaliers, the third quarter was all Duke. The Blue Devils scored all 10 points in the frame to take a 20-17 lead into the final 15 minutes. Virginia\u2019s offense looked lackluster in the quarter, and the biggest mistake came when Armstrong missed Jana on an out route deep in his own territory. The overthrow was intercepted by Duke\u2019s Rocky Shelton II, marking Armstrong\u2019s second pick of the game. Duke took advantage of the short field with an eight-yard touchdown pass to tight end Noah Gray. While the first and third quarters belonged to Duke, the second and fourth quarters were owned by Virginia. \u201cThat\u2019s just how we\u2019re taught,\u201d Armstrong said of bouncing back in the final quarter. \u201cAs soon as you come here at Virginia, you get taught to be resilient, and it manifests in our daily lives like with not having any COVID positive tests and it manifests on the field.\u201d UVa put together a 10-play, 94-yard drive that spanned the end of the third quarter and the opening minutes of the fourth quarter. Armstrong hooked up with Davis Jr. on consecutive passes. First, the left-hander tossed a ball into a crowded area with both Jana and Davis Jr, but the 6-foot-7 wide receiver brought the pass down. On the next play, Armstrong tossed a ball into the back left corner of the end zone, and Davis went up and pulled it down for a touchdown to put the Cavaliers on top 24-20 with 12:43 left. Brice made another mistake for Duke on the next possession, throwing a pass directly into the arms of Joey Blount near midfield. UVa\u2019s limited crowd celebrated as Cavalier players danced their way back to the sideline. Virginia made the Blue Devils pay for yet another costly mistake. Armstrong again found Davis Jr., this time for a beautiful 26-yard touchdown connection. Armstrong floated a pass just over an underneath defender to Davis Jr., who caught the ball and bullied his way into the end zone for the second touchdown of his young career. \u201cIt was one of our best kept secrets,\u201d Mendenhall said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to hide 6-7 for about 12 weeks in practice, but the same plays he made tonight he\u2019s been making against us every day.\u201d A fumble on a fourth-down attempt set UVa up at Duke\u2019s 10-yard line leading by 11. Taulapapa pushed through defenders on his way into the end zone for the second time Saturday. He finished the game with 95 yards and two touchdowns on 16 carries. Virginia took a commanding 38-20 lead with Taulapapa\u2019s second touchdown. Despite a lackluster first quarter and inconsistent passing, UVa showcased its deep and talented defense, and Armstrong showed flashes of why UVa coaches rave about his talent. While it was far from perfect, UVa enters Week 2 with a win on its 2020 resume.","557":"Groups of distanced seatbacks lined the stands, and periodic announcements reminded fans to wear masks. The band was nowhere to be seen, and the student section sat empty. Saturday\u2019s football game between Duke and Virginia felt like a modified spring game with fans thoroughly invested in the outcome of the game. Protocols related to COVID-19 forced UVa to place a maximum attendance limit of 1,000 people on the season opener in Scott Stadium. The atmosphere paled in comparison to last season\u2019s ACC home opener, when UVa scored 21 fourth-quarter points to shock Florida State 31-24 in front of 57,826 people. Eventually, thousands of those people poured onto the field in celebration of the victory. While there was a 21-point fourth quarter from the Cavaliers again on Saturday, the atmosphere wasn\u2019t nearly the same. This year, fans were distanced. Tailgates didn\u2019t line the streets prior to the game. The noise mimicked that of a scrimmage, rather than an ACC contest. Those in attendance, however, were stoked to be there. Bronco Mendenhall was, too. \u201cWow, what a journey it\u2019s been just to get to where we can play football,\u201d Mendenhall said. \u201cIt was a pretty surreal experience. There were many times throughout the game where I just couldn\u2019t believe we were playing and that it counted and that it was for real.\u201d With families of players and coaches allowed into the stadium, the fans watching had a deep personal rooting interest in the event. Much like Mendenhall, they wanted desperately for the Cavaliers to win. A group of nine fans, family members of Zane Zandier, rocked custom-made No. 0 Zandier shirts. Others sported the jersey of their son, brother or cousin suiting up for the Wahoos. The Zandier family had plenty to celebrate. Their favorite player finished with a game-high 15 tackles. \u201cHonestly, it wasn\u2019t too bad,\u201d Zandier said of the atmosphere. \u201cIt was definitely a little different. It was quieter. You could hear every call being made, and I think that worked out pretty good for us. I could see my family, and for me that\u2019s really all that matters.\u201d Starting quarterback Brennan Armstrong echoed those comments. While UVa\u2019s defense heard every call well, Armstrong\u2019s thunderous clap helped create a few offside penalties using his hard count. The lack of fans didn\u2019t faze the first-year starter. \u201cYou don\u2019t really notice it, you\u2019re pretty locked in on what\u2019s going on with just the football aspect,\u201d Armstrong said. \u201cLot of music was played, kept the emotions up. It was fun. It didn\u2019t really bother me too much.\u201d Virginia stresses sideline engagement during games. That\u2019s been a focus this preseason. With an engaged bench and a few hundred rowdy family members, the Cavaliers increased their Scott Stadium winning streak to nine games. \u201cObviously it\u2019s fun playing in front of all those fans, but when it gets down to it, it\u2019s still football,\u201d wide receiver Terrell Jana said. \u201cOur big thing is our culture. If we can translate that to no fans to a thousand fans to a bunch of fans, whatever it is, we\u2019ll be good.\u201d","558":"A day after losing to Wake Forest in a nonconference match, the Virginia field hockey team wouldn\u2019t be denied in the ACC clash against the Demon Deacons. Despite fewer than 24 hours between matches, UVa (1-1, 1-0 ACC) performed well Sunday, beating Wake Forest 1-0 after losing 2-1 Saturday. Laura Janssen\u2019s fourth-quarter goal put UVa on top, and the Cavaliers held on despite Wake Forest having a few penalty corner chances in the final two minutes of the match. \u201cIt felt really good,\u201d Adele Iacobucci said. \u201cWe obviously came from a loss yesterday, so we knew today we had to work really hard all four quarters to win and just to put everything we have \u2014 grit and grind \u2014 on the field.\u201d Iacobucci assisted on Janssen\u2019s goal, delivering a phenomenal pass into the circle that Janssen knocked by the goalkeeper with just 3:10 left on the clock. \u201cAll I knew was I just had to get it in the circle,\u201d Iacobucci said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have much time. It was the fourth quarter. We had to get something in whether it was pretty or not. Luckily it found Laura and she got it in the goal.\u201d The victory comes a day after UVa opened up a 1-0 lead on the Demon Deacons before fading late and losing 2-1. Two Virginia goals were called off Saturday, hurting the team\u2019s demeanor. Despite a few good chances not resulting in goals throughout the match Sunday, the Cavaliers stayed patient and waited for their chance. Ultimately, the chance came late in the match and the Cavaliers took advantage. Wake Forest\u2019s chances were limited throughout the game, as UVa\u2019s defense stood tall. Goalkeeper Taylor Henriksen picked up the first victory of her career, posting a shutout for the Wahoos. \u201cI\u2019ve been waiting two years to have my first career win,\u201d Henriksen said, \u201cso here we are, and it feels great.\u201d Henriksen recorded nine saves Saturday in the 2-1 loss, showcasing her talent in the goal. She faced fewer shots Sunday, only needing three saves to earn the shutout. Head coach Michele Madison had the Cavaliers change a few things in their defense Sunday, according to Henriksen. The minor adjustments worked. Madison also said it was her strategy Sunday to use as many bodies as needed to handle the physical toll of playing two games in two days following an offseason without any scrimmages against opponents. \u201cThey came to play,\u201d Madison said. \u201cThey found way to dig deep. Back-to-back games are tough.\u201d Overall, the weekend was productive for the Cavaliers. Facing an ACC team twice in two days isn\u2019t easy, but Virginia rallied to earn a win in the second game of the weekend. More than anything else, though, Virginia took the field. There was tremendous uncertainty this summer about the likelihood of fall sports occurring at all. This weekend, the Wahoos played twice, navigating COVID-19 protocols to reach the start of the season. The Sunday victory added to a celebratory two days. \u201cIt was amazing,\u201d Madison said Saturday. \u201cI was waiting for that whistle to blow and that whistle blew, and it was just awesome.\u201d","559":"The University of Virginia athletics department revealed its COVID-19 testing results from Sept. 21-27 on Monday, announcing that it had administered 1,168 tests with 22 positive test results. Since testing began in early July, UVa has administered 4,973 tests with a total of 64 positives. The overall test positivity since testing started sits at 1.3%. While Virginia doesn\u2019t reveal the positive cases by sport, Bronco Mendenhall told the media Monday that UVa\u2019s football team has no active cases within its program. The football team hasn\u2019t reported a positive case since July 24. Even without any positive cases, Mendenhall says waiting for results still creates an anxious feeling. Despite general nervousness, the Cavaliers have done well to keep positive cases low. The football team has totaled three positives since July 5. \u201cWe have not had a player test positive since they arrived back,\u201d Mendenhall said. \u201cThe players that tested positive, and there were three, it was attributed to what they came back with. There\u2019s been nothing since then. Not one.\u201d Virginia\u2019s head football coach acknowledged that it could all change tomorrow. The university is currently placing students under increased restrictions to help slow the spread of COVID-19 within the campus community. The latest results from Virginia athletics show that positive tests can occur within the athletic programs, with 22 being reported in each of the previous two weeks of testing. Numbers have risen since the testing results during preseason training without students on Grounds. \u201cAt least to this point, though, it\u2019s been miraculous,\u201d Mendenhall said of the football team\u2019s results. The Virginia football team will undergo tests Monday, Wednesday and Friday ahead of traveling to Clemson for Saturday\u2019s showdown with the nation\u2019s No. 1 team. In addition to football, the Cavaliers\u2019 field hockey, men\u2019s and women\u2019s soccer and volleyball teams are all expected to be in action this weekend. Members of those programs will also be tested for COVID-19 three times per week. Players who test positive for the virus must self-isolate for a minimum of 10 days and close contacts of those who test positive are asked to quarantine for two weeks.","560":"The former Virginia star started to say she had a \u201cgreat\u201d rookie season before quickly pivoting and saying she posted a \u201cgood\u201d 2020 campaign. Playing in the WNBA bubble in Bradenton, Florida, Willoughby and the New York Liberty missed the playoffs with a 2-20 record. Despite frequent losses, the Liberty possesses a talented young group with potential. Willoughby played an important role within that youthful roster, finishing the season among the top 10 of WNBA rookies in points, assists, steals, 3-pointers made and free throws made. The No. 10 overall pick in the 2020 WNBA Draft played 17.4 minutes per game, averaging 5.8 points and 2.4 rebounds per contest. \u201cI was pretty proud of myself,\u201d Willoughby said of her first WNBA season. \u201cI think I definitely grew over the course of the season. I think I was still kind of true to my nature in terms of being a hard worker, high energy, just tough player.\u201d Consistency varied for Willoughby\u2019s offensive showings, but her defensive effort and intensity remained high all season. She randomly became hot from long range, having two games of perfect 3-point shooting on at least three attempts despite not making a 3-pointer in 15 of the team\u2019s 22 games. In a late-season performance, Willoughby dropped 21 points on 7-of-8 shooting in a loss to the Los Angeles Sparks. When Willoughby\u2019s shot hit, it seemed to hit all game. She added a steal and a block in the contest. \u201cI think I was pretty solid on the defensive end,\u201d Willoughby said. \u201cSometimes just playing against some of the greatest players, they\u2019re gonna get their points, but I think overall it was pretty solid. Offensively, I know I have a lot of work to do but was proud of how I put together some good performances and also efficient.\u201d She learned what it took on a daily basis to play professionally, saying she needs to be faster at recognizing plays and defenses to help grow into her offensive potential. Willoughby also gained a better understanding of the work required to succeed at the WNBA level. Outside of game action, Willoughby grew into her voice. The Liberty dedicated their season to Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old woman who was killed by police officers in Louisville in March. The police entered Taylor\u2019s apartment during the night to execute a no-knock search warrant and shot Taylor. Taylor\u2019s death and the lack of charges for the police officers who killed Taylor were among the reasons for nationwide protests this summer and fall. The Liberty spoke out in support of Taylor and her family throughout the season, drawing attention to her death. \u201cIt\u2019s an ongoing process,\u201d Willoughby said of using her voice to address social issues. \u201cI think I\u2019ve definitely learned a lot just being around my teammates. Some of them are more outspoken or use their platforms a little bit better than I do at this moment, and they\u2019re veterans. Looking up to them and picking their brains a little bit and learning, I definitely think I got more comfortable with my voice.\u201d Teammates encouraged Willoughby to use her voice, saying people listen to her when she speaks. As Willoughby said, it\u2019s an ongoing process to determine when and how to use her voice to help create positive change in communities. She called it \u201cinspiring and empowering\u201d to be a part of the WNBA during the summer as the league took a stand against racial injustice and police brutality. Following the police shooting of Wisconsin man Jacob Blake, several WNBA games were postponed. For years, the league has been at the forefront of speaking out about social issues. That didn\u2019t change this summer. Players like Willoughby used their voices to protest change while still competing in a bubble because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The regular season was shortened to 22 games this summer instead of the usual 34 and there wasn\u2019t the typical home crowd at games this season. Frequent COVID-19 tests were also used to help ensure players were safe while within the bubble. Despite an unusual rookie season, Willoughby embraced the top level and learned from teammates and peers both on and off the court. \u201cI feel like if I\u2019m back next year I\u2019m gonna have another rookie season because hopefully things will be back to normal,\u201d Willoughby said. \u201cIt\u2019ll be a learning curve still. I don\u2019t even know if this season and what it felt like can compare to a normal WNBA season, but I do think there was a lot to learn and grow from and appreciate.\u201d","561":"Some athletes claim that they were born to play a particular sport. Woodberry Forest senior golfer Ben Haggin is living proof of it. \u201cFor my whole life, my family and I have lived on a golf course,\u201d Haggin said. \u201cWhen I was about two months old, my dad would wheel me over to the course and set the stroller to where I would watch him hit balls. Once I got old enough, he would put balls on a tee and I would try and hit them as hard as I could. Ever since then, I have been in love with the game.\u201d That love has grown into an opportunity of a lifetime for Haggin, who has verbally committed to play golf at the University of Virginia. \u201cToward the end of middle school, playing college golf at a prestigious academic institution was my dream, and UVa fit right into that dream,\u201d Haggin said. \u201cFrom the beginning of the recruiting process, I knew UVa was the school for me. As soon as they offered me, I accepted. It is my dream to play golf and attend UVa and I still don\u2019t think it has sunk in yet.\u201d Haggin has been a dominant force on the links in Central Virginia for the past two seasons. He received all-Prep League honors in 2019 and was an all-state performer as a freshman and sophomore. The senior ranks fifth on Woodberry\u2019s career scoring average list and was named Prep League Most Valuable Player in 2019 before last spring\u2019s season\u2019s was canceled because of COVID-19. \u201cIt stung to not have a season last spring,\u201d Haggin said, \u201cbut I am excited to see what the future holds.\u201d This summer, Haggin said his golf game really took off, just in time for the height of the recruiting process. When UVa coach Bowen Sargent extended an offer to join the Cavaliers\u2019 program, Haggin jumped at the chance. \u201cWhile getting recruited, I think that Coach Sargent saw a lot of raw talent in me,\u201d Haggin said. \u201cI\u2019ve never been formally coached and I grew up playing many other sports. For my entire life, I\u2019ve been playing golf based on raw athleticism. Therefore, once I start getting some formal coaching, I can make the most of my potential.\u201d Along with a premier education, Haggin said UVa provides all the necessary tools to help his game grow. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to dismiss the world-class facilities that were just constructed at Birdwood,\u201d he said. \u201cFrom the indoor facility to the new course and short-game area, each player has the opportunity to become the best that they can be.\u201d The Woodberry Forest product had opportunities to join several major college programs, but none of them quite compared to the Cavaliers. \u201cUVa had always been No. 1 on my list because of the prestige of the degree and the opportunities that will be presented to me next fall,\u201d Haggin said. \u201cI had a few other ACC and SEC schools show interest, but none of them interested me more than UVa. I truly believe that UVa is the place where I can reach my full academic and athletic potential.\u201d His goal heading into college is to compete for a spot in the Cavaliers\u2019 starting lineup. With the caliber of players on the team already, as well as the incoming recruits, Haggin knows it won\u2019t be easy, but he\u2019s ready for the challenge. \u201cAt UVa, I aspire to be the best player and teammate that I can be,\u201d Haggin said. \u201cI am blessed to have the opportunity to do what I love at the next level. At this point, I feel like it is my duty to aspire to be the best I can be. I have been gifted with this opportunity and it is important that I take advantage of it.\u201d Haggin has set the bar high for his future in golf. \u201cThe end goal for me would be to make it to the PGA Tour, but at the college level, I aspire to help lead my team to an ACC and even a NCAA championship,\u201d Haggin said. \u201cWe will have every opportunity to be one of the best teams in the country and I can\u2019t wait to be a part of the journey.\u201d","562":"Both Virginia and Virginia Tech responded well after their game on Sept. 19 was postponed. Despite missing 23 players and two coaches due to COVID-19 positive tests and contact tracing, Virginia Tech beat N.C. State 45-24 in a dominating performance. UVa stumbled out of the gate against Duke, fumbling the opening kickoff. Even with three turnovers, Virginia forced seven of its own in a 38-20 triumph over the Blue Devils. Elsewhere, Miami cemented itself as a team to watch this fall, while Duke, Georgia Tech and Florida State had Saturdays to forget. 1. Clemson (2-0, 1-0 ACC, No. 1 last week) The Tigers enjoyed a week off, giving them extra time to prepare for UVa. The last time Virginia and Clemson met, Dabo Swinney and the Tigers won 62-17 in the 2019 ACC Championship Game. The Tigers would love a repeat performance. Next: vs. Virginia, Saturday, 8 p.m. 2. Notre Dame (2-0, 1-0 ACC, No. 2 last week) The Fighting Irish were idle last week after positive COVID-19 tests within its program lead to a postponed game against Wake Forest. We won\u2019t see Notre Dame again until its Oct. 10 clash with a slumping Florida State. Next: Bye 3. Miami (3-0, 2-0 ACC, No. 4 last week) Miami\u2019s body of work keeps improving. While Florida State doesn\u2019t seem like a quality team, the Hurricanes looked special in their 52-10 win over the Seminoles on Saturday. There\u2019s still a gap between Clemson and Miami, but quarterback D\u2019Eriq King and company are firmly in the mix to earn the No. 2 spot in the league. King accounted for 332 total yards and a pair of touchdowns Saturday. Next: Bye 4. Pittsburgh (3-0, 2-0 ACC, No. 6 last week) Pitt pulled out a gritty 23-20 win over Louisville on Saturday, moving them to 3-0 on the season. While scoring points certainly isn\u2019t the team\u2019s strong point, the defense slowed a high-powered Louisville offense. The Panthers held Malik Cunningham to just 110 total yards, and they forced the quarterback into three interceptions. Next: vs. N.C. State, Saturday, noon 5. North Carolina (1-0, 1-0 ACC, No. 3 last week) We\u2019ve only seen UNC once this season. The 31-6 win over Syracuse wasn\u2019t overly impressive, but Sam Howell and company are expected to perform well this season. The Tar Heels are sliding down the power poll because of barely seeing the field, not due to a lack of talent. Next: at Boston College, Saturday, 3:30 p.m. 6. Virginia Tech (1-0, 1-0 ACC, No. 9 last week) Saturday was quite the statement from the Hokies. Shorthanded, Virginia Tech blew out N.C. State, 45-24. The Hokies rushed for 314 yards and three touchdowns in the victory, and third-string quarterback Quincy Patterson II stepped up when called upon. With Hendon Hooker out and Braxton Burmeister leaving the game early with a hand cramp, Patterson II completed four passes for 75 yards and two touchdowns. He added 10 carries for 47 yards and another touchdown. Burmeister eventually returned. A healthy Virginia Tech could be scary. Next: at Duke, Saturday, 4 p.m. 7. Virginia (1-0, 1-0 ACC, No. 5 last week) Welcome to college football, Lavel Davis Jr. The 6-foot-7 freshman wide receiver hauled in four receptions for 101 yards and two touchdowns in his collegiate debut, and Virginia\u2019s defense forced seven turnovers as the Cavaliers beat Duke, 38-20. Some first-game sloppiness against a subpar Duke team moves UVa down in the poll, but the Cavaliers should improve as the season progresses. Next: at Clemson, Saturday, 8 p.m. 8. Boston College (2-0, 1-0 ACC, No. 8 last week) The Eagles avoided a scare Saturday, narrowly beating Texas State, 24-21. Boston College erased a 14-point deficit to pick up the victory, but there\u2019s plenty of room for improvement moving forward. The Eagles were outgained by a 1-3 Texas State team. Next: vs. North Carolina, Saturday, 3:30 p.m. 9. Louisville (1-2, 0-2 ACC, No. 7 last week) Losses to Miami and Pitt aren\u2019t embarrassing by any means, but Louisville entered the season as a trendy pick to finish second to Clemson in the ACC. Instead, the Cardinals lost a shootout with Miami and a defensive battle with Pitt. Quarterback Malik Cunningham, who had been going by Micale previously, suffered a big hit at the end of the game to add injury to insult. Fortunately, the Cardinals don\u2019t play this weekend. Next: Bye 10. Syracuse (1-2, 1-2 ACC, No. 15 last week) After two subpar showings, the Orange bulldozed Georgia Tech, 37-20. Syracuse ran the ball 41 times for 163 yards and two touchdowns in the victory, while also intercepting four Georgia Tech passes in the 17-point win. Next: Bye 11. N.C. State (1-1, 1-1 ACC, No. 10 last week) The Wolfpack entered Saturday with a tremendous opportunity. N.C. State faced a Virginia Tech team missing 23 players and two coaches. Instead of capitalizing on the opportunity, the Wolfpack lost 45-24 in a game that wasn\u2019t close after the first few minutes. Next: at Pitt, Saturday, noon 12. Georgia Tech (1-2, 1-1 ACC, No. 11 last week) Losing to Syracuse by 17 points is embarrassing, and Georgia Tech remains an ACC bottom dweller despite an opening week win over Florida State. It turns out the Seminoles just aren\u2019t very good. Next: Bye 13. Wake Forest (0-2, 0-2 ACC, No. 12 last week) The Demon Deacons opened with a loss to Clemson before losing to N.C. State. Campbell comes to town Friday in a game that should provide Wake Forest with win No. 1. Next: vs. Campbell, Friday, 7 p.m. 14. Duke (0-3, 0-3 ACC, No. 14 last week) On the bright side, Duke\u2019s 20 points against Virginia surpassed its combined point total of 19 from its first two games of the season. On the other hand, Duke committed seven turnovers in the 38-20 loss to the Wahoos. The Blue Devils are an absolute mess offensively. Next: vs. Virginia Tech, Saturday, 4 p.m. 15. Florida State (0-2, 0-2 ACC, No. 13 last week) This isn\u2019t your father\u2019s Florida State team, kids. The Seminoles lined up against Miami last weekend, hoping to keep the rivalry matchup close. Instead, Florida State lost 52-10 in an abysmal effort. The Seminoles trailed 38-3 at halftime after 30 minutes of subpar defense. Florida State fans didn\u2019t need to watch past the second quarter. Next: vs. Jacksonville State, Saturday, 4 p.m.","563":"The Virginia women\u2019s soccer team has two wins over Virginia Tech, but it\u2019s still seeking its first conference victory. As if the 2020 sports season couldn\u2019t become more unusual, both of UVa\u2019s wins over the Hokies are designated as nonconference matchups this fall. The odd scheduling comes due to scheduling changes caused by COVID-19 and a shortened fall season. Despite a strange fall slate, the Cavaliers (2-1-1, 0-1-1 ACC) have completed four games amid a pandemic. They\u2019re competing at a time when they weren\u2019t sure they would. Regardless, they want ACC win No. 1. \u201cThere\u2019s a real appreciation for where we are and how far we\u2019ve come, but there\u2019s also this more singular focus of trying to prepare for each game and to try to maximize as much as you can out of the season not just in terms of results, but in terms of your performances and developing your players and those kinds of things,\u201d head coach Steve Swanson said. \u201cI\u2019m proud of the team. I\u2019m always proud of the team, but I\u2019m proud of the team even more so now just because they\u2019re managing the times as well as they possibly can.\u201d Making it to the season was a challenge. COVID-19 protocols still remain in place, as does the need to perform well on the field. Through four games, Swanson feels confident in his group. He does, however, wish they took better advantage of scoring chances. After opening the year with three goals against Virginia Tech, UVa has found the back of the net just twice in the following three games. \u201cI think we\u2019ve actually played some really good soccer,\u201d Swanson said. \u201cIf you kind of look at all these games and say, \u2018What\u2019s the key component?\u2019 We\u2019re not scoring goals. That\u2019s gonna always leave you in trouble in our game, if you can\u2019t finish your chances.\u201d Swanson felt his team did enough to beat Duke, but the game ended in a 1-1 draw. He feels a 3-0 loss to Clemson certainly could\u2019ve been closer, and the 1-0 overtime win over Virginia Tech in the second meeting featured a few missed opportunities that could\u2019ve ended the game earlier. Virginia will need to convert its chances Thursday night when it hosts Pittsburgh. The Panthers are 6-0 this season and 1-0 in the ACC. They\u2019ve outscored their opponents 17-2 through six contests, and they\u2019ve posted four shutouts. Beating Pitt and earning ACC win No. 1 requires a complete team effort. Pitt presents a good test for the Wahoos, who have given a few underclassmen chances to shine this fall. Redshirt freshman goalkeeper Cayla White started for the Cavaliers in their latest win over Virginia Tech, posting a shutout victory. Without a spring season, Swanson wanted to give his young goalkeeper a chance to see game action. She has responded well. Freshman forward and midfielder Lia Godfrey has also impressed throughout the fall, using her speed to create consistent scoring chances for UVa. Defender Samar Guidry has logged 320 minutes for Virginia through the first four matches. Virginia hopes with time the underclassmen will develop and the upperclassmen will take advantage of scoring chances more consistently. While the record might not accurately reflect it, Swanson is pleased with his team\u2019s performance. The Cavaliers just need to turn chances into goals. They\u2019ll hope to finish opportunities Thursday against a good defensive Pitt team. \u201cI think we\u2019re all very confident with what this team\u2019s capable of doing, but we just have to get much more precise and much better quality in and around the goal in order to consistently win,\u201d Swanson said. \u201cThat\u2019s probably our biggest challenge right now.\u201d","564":"The UVa men\u2019s soccer team\u2019s season-opening match with Virginia Tech has been postponed, both programs announced Friday. The game, which was scheduled to be played on Saturday in Blacksburg, has been rescheduled for Oct. 14. There was no official reason given for the postponement, although UVa\u2019s release did cite the team\u2019s COVID-19 protocols. All ACC programs competing this fall are testing for the virus three times per week. Postponing Saturday\u2019s contest means George Gelnovatch\u2019s team won\u2019t take the field in a game until Oct. 9, when it is set to host Louisville. The Cavaliers previously had a pair of scrimmages scheduled for September canceled. The team is set to play six games this fall with the first contest coming against Louisville. The regular season will begin on Oct. 9 and is set to come to a close on Nov. 6. The ACC Tournament begins Nov. 15.","565":"The Virginia volleyball program announced Saturday morning that its scheduled Saturday evening match with Duke would be postponed due to a lack of available players. According to the release, UVa is dealing with injuries as well as having players out because of COVID-19. The match is expected to be rescheduled for later in the season. Virginia and Duke played Friday night in Charlottesville, with the Blue Devils winning the match in three sets. It\u2019s unclear how much COVID-19 contact tracing may affect both squads in future days after competing in somewhat close contact for over an hour Friday. ACC volleyball teams are required to be tested for COVID-19 three times per week. Student-athletes who test positive for the virus must self-isolate for a minimum of 10 days. Close contacts need to quarantine for two weeks at a time. UVa is scheduled to retake the court Friday at North Carolina. There was no additional scheduling adjustment announced in Saturday\u2019s release. As of Saturday, the match against North Carolina remains on the schedule. The postponement was the second of the weekend for UVa athletics. The men\u2019s soccer team was scheduled to play at Virginia Tech on Saturday night, but the game was postponed. No official reasoning was given for the change in schedule. Men\u2019s soccer is set to play its first match this upcoming Friday at home against Louisville. It will be the team\u2019s first match of the season after having a pair of exhibitions canceled in September.","566":"CLEMSON, S.C. \u2014 The Virginia football team will be without seven student-athletes and one full-time coach against Clemson on Saturday night due to COVID-19, according to a release from the school. All of the athletes and coaches, who were not identified by the school, are in isolation or quarantine. The coach tested positive for the virus, while it\u2019s unclear how many of the football players tested positive and how many are in quarantine due to contact tracing. Individuals who test positive for the virus must self-isolate for at least 10 days, according to local health guidelines. Close contacts are asked to quarantine for two weeks. The news breaks Virginia football\u2019s streak of weeks without positive COVID-19 tests within the program. The Cavaliers hadn\u2019t reported a positive COVID-19 result within the program since July 24. After a clean bill of health, the Wahoos are down a handful of players and a coach. With the news comes the reality that the Virginia athletic bubble is largely broken. The men\u2019s soccer program had a pair of scrimmages canceled in September, and the Cavaliers and Virginia Tech were forced to reschedule a match slated for Saturday. No official reason was given for the postponement of the match, but a previous scrimmage with Clemson was canceled due to positive COVID-19 tests. The UVa volleyball team hosted Duke on Friday night, but the Wahoos were unable to compete with the Blue Devils as scheduled on Saturday. The Cavaliers cited COVID-19 issues and injuries as the cause for the postponement.","567":"On Monday, the University of Virginia athletics department announced 12 additional positive COVID-19 results in its tests from the Sept. 28-Oct. 4. During that week, the athletic department administered 1,012 tests to student-athletes and staff members. On Saturday, the football team announced that one of its coaches would miss the game against Clemson following a positive test. Seven football student-athletes were deemed unavailable for competition as well, although it was not said if all seven tested positive or if it was a combination of positive tests and contact tracing. In other sports, the UVa volleyball team postponed a Saturday match due to a lack of available players stemming from both COVID-19 issues and injuries. Men\u2019s soccer also had a Saturday match with Virginia Tech postponed, although no official reason for the postponement was shared. The athletic department also revealed a minor oversight in a previous reported round of testing results. The shared results from Sept. 21-27 did not include 149 tests given to the football program from a third-party vendor. Those came the day before its game with Duke. All 149 of those tests came back negative. Since UVa student-athletes and staff returned to Grounds on July 5, a total of 6,004 tests have been given. Of those 6,004 tests, 76 were positives. That\u2019s a percent positivity rate of 1.3%. Anyone who tests positive must self-isolate for at least 10 days. Close contacts of those who test positive for COVID-19 must quarantine for two weeks. Head football coach Bronco Mendenhall shared Monday that he\u2019s hoping to implement additional measures and protocols to help prevent possible COVID-19 spread within the program. Prior to positive test results last week, UVa football hadn\u2019t reported a positive test since July 24. The two-month streak ended last week. \u201cWe\u2019ve just gone from cheering after every test since early July and then when I found out \u2014 and it was late in the week \u2014 and I announced to the team that we had a number of tests, there was like silence,\u201d Mendenhall said. \u201cIt sounded funny, saying it, and the team looked like, \u2018Wait, did he just say that we had some positives?\u2019 And then no one knew quite what to do.\u201d The positive results came from Wednesday tests, and the results weren\u2019t known by Mendenhall until late Thursday night. \u201cI was sweating it,\u201d Mendenhall said. \u201cI didn\u2019t have my results back until like 10 at night that Thursday. We tested Wednesday morning, so I was thinking, \u2018OK, who\u2019s gonna be the head coach?\u2019 It was agonizing because it had taken so long, and that was abnormal.\u201d Mendenhall added that chairs started to move farther away from teammates during the team meeting when he revealed the positive results, and people started tightening masks. He says the news brought heightened awareness to the team\u2019s protocols. He\u2019s looking closer at the spacing between lockers, saying that could help avoid losing players in the future via contact tracing protocols. Additional protocols already in place include the use of multiple buses or vans to transport the team to the stadium on game day. There are also limitations on where players can go in the team facility. Players don\u2019t have access to the second floor of the McCue Center, where coaching offices are located. Even with strict protocols, the UVa football program saw the virus impact its program during the season. Mendenhall added that he\u2019s unsure of the cause of positive tests. Regardless of where the results stemmed from, UVa joined a growing list of ACC football programs to be impacted by the virus this fall. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t like some big shock,\u201d senior cornerback De\u2019Vante Cross said. \u201cIt\u2019s a virus. There\u2019s like 125 people on the team. At some point, somewhere along the line someone was gonna get it. I think we handled it very well. We handled it as well as you can. We just moved on from it and continue to work on our game plan.\u201d","568":"After a respectable showing in a 41-23 loss to Clemson, the Virginia football team returns home this week. The Cavaliers (1-1, 1-1 ACC) host N.C. State (2-1, 2-1 ACC) at noon on Saturday in Scott Stadium. Last week\u2019s performance showed the Wahoos\u2019 areas of strength as well as spots for improvement, and they\u2019re hopeful to put together a complete team performance this weekend against an up-and-down opponent. The Cavaliers also enter this week managing COVID-19 after seven student-athletes and a full-time coach were unavailable against Clemson due to COVID-19 testing results. Early in the week, the team\u2019s focus lies mostly on their on-field opponent. In the back of their mind, they know they\u2019ll need to stay vigilant in following the health protocols to safely take the field this Saturday. N.C. State strolls into Charlottesville on Saturday as a bit of an unknown. The Wolfpack picked up a narrow 30-29 victory over a ranked Pittsburgh team Saturday. That came after being embarrassed 45-24 by a depleted Virginia Tech team. The Wolfpack opened the season with a 45-42 win over Wake Forest. Saturday\u2019s matchup will be just the second meeting between UVa and N.C. State with Bronco Mendenhall leading the Wahoos. Dave Doeren\u2019s team beat the Cavaliers 35-21 back in 2018. \u201cAs much reading or as much as you know the head coach or as much as you think, until you play a team, their true identity, their true character, just kind of the culture of the program you don\u2019t see, you don\u2019t feel and you don\u2019t know up close and personal,\u201d Mendenhall said. The Cavaliers will attempt to understand the Wolfpack through this week\u2019s film study. UVa faces a Wolfpack team that can score in bunches and averages 33 points per contest. On the flip side, N.C. State\u2019s defense looks weak, allowing an ACC-worst 38.7 points per contest. Overall, Mendenhall says he\u2019s impressed with what he\u2019s seen from this week\u2019s opponent. Despite players missing time at the beginning of the season due to COVID-19 and contact tracing, the Wolfpack has pushed through iffy defensive showings to start the season 2-1 in the ACC with a victory over a ranked foe. \u201cI think they\u2019re doing a nice job of adapting, just like every program is expected to do and really that\u2019s the bottom line in terms of this 2020 year,\u201d Mendenhall said. No Walker news Indiana transfer running back Ronnie Walker Jr. has yet to hear back from the NCAA on the second part of his appeal process to earn a waiver for immediate eligibility. Mendenhall believes the Virginia native, who said he joined UVa in part to be closer to his mother, deserves the waiver. Virginia\u2019s head coach remained calm, but shared his frustrations Monday with the lack of guidance from the NCAA on the situation. \u201cIt seems like our urgency is more than maybe that of who we\u2019re working with,\u201d Mendenhall said. Even without the running back, UVa\u2019s offense has performed well through two games. The Cavaliers are averaging 167.5 yards per game on the ground, up about 45 yards from last year\u2019s season average. \u201cI think the biggest difference is definitely the mindset, and the attitude is that we go out there, we know we prepared, we practiced really hard, we have a great game plan, we just go out and try to execute it to the fullest of our ability,\u201d offensive lineman Dillon Reinkensmeyer said. \u201cIt never hurts when everyone\u2019s coming back and we have good experience, so I think there\u2019s a lot of different factors that have come into play for this year and why we started to play really well, but we know that we know that we have hit nowhere near our ceiling.\u201d Of the ACC teams to play three games this fall, N.C. State has allowed the most rushing touchdowns (nine). Only Florida State and Duke have allowed more rushing touchdowns this season, and both those teams have played four games. The Wolfpack allow 4.4 yards per carry, the third-worst mark in the conference. After two productive weeks, UVa\u2019s offensive line enters Saturday confident, even with Walker Jr. still awaiting word on his appeals process. Up next Virginia\u2019s road contest at Wake Forest on Oct. 17 will kick off at 4 p.m., the ACC announced Monday. The game will air on the ACC Network. That marks four consecutive games on the ACC Network to open Virginia\u2019s season. Like Clemson, Wake Forest will have an open date before facing the Wahoos. The Demon Deacons earned their first win of the season last Friday, beating Campbell, 66-14. They\u2019ll rest this week before hosting Virginia the following weekend.","569":"The Virginia volleyball program announced two match postponements Tuesday. The Cavaliers\u2019 upcoming matches against North Carolina, which were scheduled for Friday and Sunday, will be pushed to a later date. The matches were postponed due to a lack of available UVa players. The Cavaliers are dealing with issues related to both injuries and COVID-19. The announcement comes after Virginia\u2019s match scheduled for last Saturday against Duke was postponed for the same reason. Virginia has played two matches this season, beating The Citadel in mid-September before falling to Duke last Friday. The Cavaliers have competed twice while having three matches postponed. Head coach Aaron Smith\u2019s team is scheduled to take the court on Oct. 16 against Virginia Tech. That gives the Wahoos more than a week to recover from injuries while also following protocols related to COVID-19. Any student-athlete who tests positive for the virus must self-isolate for a minimum of 10 days. Close contacts must quarantine for 14 days, per local health guidelines. Given the need to quarantine for 14 days, it\u2019s unclear if the Wahoos will have enough players available for the Oct. 16 match. Virginia\u2019s athletic department shared that there were 12 positive COVID-19 tests within the athletic programs from the week of Sept. 28-Oct. 4, but no breakdown of sport-by-sport positive tests are provided. It\u2019s unclear the extent of a possible outbreak within the volleyball team. There has been no official word on when matches with Duke and North Carolina will be rescheduled.","570":"Watching ACC football this fall offers fans a chance to watch their favorite teams after an offseason of uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic. Through the first few weeks, from an on-field perspective, there haven\u2019t been many fireworks. Louisville vs. Pittsburgh was a quality matchup, but the Cardinals are up to two losses this fall and the Panthers laid an egg against N.C. State last weekend. Miami looks impressive through three games, but its schedule leaves fans and experts wondering just how good the Hurricanes are, even with Houston transfer D\u2019Eriq King excelling at quarterback. Fortunately, the ACC matchups improve this week. Miami travels to Clemson for a primetime showdown, and North Carolina hosts Virginia Tech in a noon battle between top-25 teams. It\u2019s a good week to be an ACC football fan. There\u2019s even bonus Friday action with Georgia Tech hosting Louisville. For those who enjoy watching Florida State flounder, the Seminoles travel to South Bend to face an undefeated Notre Dame team. That game might get ugly in a hurry. Ahead of a great slate of games, let\u2019s check out the latest power rankings for the Power 5 league. 1. Clemson (3-0, 2-0 ACC, No. 1 last week) The Tigers beat a scrappy Virginia team 41-23 last week, but the game didn\u2019t come without concerns for Dabo Swinney. UVa amassed more than 400 yards of total offense, showcasing an ability to move the ball effectively both through the air and on the ground. Clemson\u2019s defense needs to stiffen up against a high-powered Miami offense. On the flip side, Trevor Lawrence and Travis Etienne remain elite, giving Clemson the potential to score 50 points against any program. Next: vs. Miami, Saturday, 7:30 p.m. 2. Notre Dame (2-0, 1-0 ACC, No. 2 last week) Notre Dame hasn\u2019t played a game since Sept. 19 due to issues with COVID-19. Fortunately, the Fighting Irish return to the field to face Florida State, a team that looks to be among the worst in the ACC. Brian Kelly\u2019s team should be just fine. Next: vs. Florida State, Saturday, 7:30 p.m. 3. Miami (3-0, 2-0 ACC, No. 3 last week) D\u2019Eriq King and company enjoyed a bye last week. That\u2019s good news for a team preparing to face Clemson this Saturday. Memorial Stadium won\u2019t be full, but even with limited attendance, it\u2019s an intimidating venue. King and the Hurricanes need to be at their best to have a chance against the Tigers. Next: at Clemson, Saturday, 7:30 p.m. 4. Virginia Tech (2-0, 2-0 ACC, No. 6 last week) N.C. State\u2019s upset victory over Pitt makes the Hokies\u2019 45-24 win over the Wolfpack look even better. Virginia Tech followed up its season-opening victory with a 38-31 win over Duke. Khalil Herbert ran for 208 yards and two touchdowns on just 20 carries. While North Carolina might still be a better team, Virginia Tech has looked more impressive through two weeks and earns the No. 4 spot in the power poll. Next: at North Carolina, Saturday, noon 5. North Carolina (2-0, 2-0 ACC, No. 5 last week) The Tar Heels looked a bit rusty in their second game of the season, surviving a road scare at Boston College, 26-22. UNC\u2019s secondary struggled at times, allowing 313 passing yards and a pair of touchdowns. Offensively, Sam Howell completed just over 50% of his passes. It wasn\u2019t crisp, but the Tar Heels won after multiple weeks off. Next: vs. Virginia Tech, Saturday, noon 6. Virginia (1-1, 1-1 ACC, No. 7 last week) I\u2019m moving UVa up after the Cavaliers lost by 18 to Clemson because they answered some of my questions. The offensive weapons\u00a0\u2014 ranging from 5-foot-9 Billy Kemp IV to 6-7 targets Lavel Davis Jr. and Tony Poljan\u00a0\u2014 are reliable. Quarterback Brennan Armstrong appears ready to lead an ACC attack. The defense seems steady and should create havoc against inferior offenses. The Cavaliers aren\u2019t a major threat to make the ACC title game yet, but by mid-October, they very well may be in the mix. Next: vs. N.C. State, Saturday, noon 7. N.C. State (2-1, 2-1 ACC, No. 11 last week) Take a bow Devin Leary. N.C. State\u2019s quarterback torched Pittsburgh\u2019s defense in a 30-29 win over the Panthers. He found the end zone four times through the air, and he appears to be the answer at quarterback for the Wolfpack. He also added 165 yards and a touchdown in a 45-24 loss to Virginia Tech. He\u2019s thrown five touchdowns and no interceptions over 60 passes this fall. Next: at Virginia, Saturday, noon 8. Pittsburgh (3-1, 2-1 ACC, No. 4 last week) The Panthers were in an ideal position to start 4-0 and 3-0 in the ACC. Instead, the team\u2019s defense let it down in a 30-29 loss to N.C. State. The Wolfpack scored the go-ahead touchdown with 23 seconds left to cap off a 336-yard, four-touchdown passing performance from quarterback Devin Leary. Kenny Pickett threw for 411 yards, and the Panthers still lost. That\u2019s shocking. Next: at Boston College, Saturday, 4 p.m. 9. Boston College (2-1, 1-1 ACC, No. 8 last week) Somewhat surprisingly, Boston College put a scare into North Carolina the week after nearly losing to Texas State. The Eagles fell to UNC, 26-22, but came within a two-point conversion of tying the game at 24 with 45 seconds left in the contest. Boston College is far from a pushover. Next: vs. Pittsburgh, Saturday, 4 p.m. 10. Louisville (1-2, 0-2 ACC. No. 9 last week) The Cardinals are still a dangerous team, but they\u2019ve started the season slowly. Fortunately, they face Georgia Tech on Friday. It\u2019s a winnable game for a team in desperate need of a positive result after lofty preseason expectations. Next: at Georgia Tech, Friday, 7 p.m. 11. Wake Forest (1-2, 0-2 ACC, No. 13 last week) That\u2019s more like it. Even though it came against an FCS team, Wake Forest earned a much-needed win in a 66-14 rout of Campbell. The Demon Deacons looked strong in the victory, and their two losses this season don\u2019t look too shabby after N.C. State upset Pitt. Wake Forest fell to Clemson and the Wolfpack to start its ACC slate. Next: Bye 12. Syracuse (1-2, 1-2 ACC, No. 10 last week) Syracuse beat Georgia Tech before its bye to avoid starting the season winless through three games. They host winless Duke at 12:30 this Saturday in a game almost guaranteed to be overshadowed by Virginia Tech-North Carolina and N.C. State-UVa, which both start at noon. Next: vs. Duke, Saturday, 12:30 p.m. 13. Georgia Tech (1-2, 1-1 ACC, No. 12 last week) On the bright side, Georgia Tech has a win over Florida State. On the flip side, the Yellow Jackets also have a terrible 17-point loss to Syracuse on their resume. They hope an extra week of preparation pays off Friday night. Next: vs. Louisville, Friday, 7 p.m. 14. Florida State (1-2, 0-2 ACC, No. 15 last week) Hey, look! A Florida State win! Despite trailing early against Jacksonville State, an FCS team, the Seminoles rallied for a 41-24 victory. It\u2019s going to take time for this program to turn things around. Next: Saturday, at Notre Dame, 7:30 p.m. 15. Duke (0-4, 0-4 ACC, No. 14 last week) Duke lost to Virginia Tech 38-31 last week, allowing 324 rushing yards. Despite the defeat, there were some positives. Chase Brice only threw one interception. Next: at Syracuse, Saturday, 12:30 p.m.","571":"Wednesday brought with it another sports schedule change for the University of Virginia. This time, women\u2019s soccer joined the list of Olympic sports impacted by COVID-19 and injuries. It\u2019s been a week of postponements and cancellations for the Cavaliers, but the programs are still navigating competition amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Much like volleyball, the UVa women\u2019s soccer team won\u2019t play at North Carolina this week. The Cavaliers were supposed to play the Tar Heels on Thursday in a nonconference match, but a lack of UVa players due to COVID-19 and injuries caused a cancellation. The Virginia volleyball program had three recent matches postponed for the same reason. The athletic department revealed Monday that there were 12 positive COVID-19 test results from Sept. 28-Oct. 4. No sport-by-sport breakdown of the positive results is provided. Virginia\u2019s women\u2019s soccer team last played Sunday, beating Miami 3-0 in Charlottesville. The team is next scheduled to take the field on Oct. 15 when it hosts Louisville. That leaves about a week for players to rest and recover from both injuries and potential COVID-19 exposure. The Cavaliers have played six times this season, going 4-1-1 overall and 2-1-1 in the ACC. The Oct. 15 match against Louisville is designated as an ACC match and would count in the conference standings, assuming it\u2019s played. Cross country Virginia men win Wolfpack Invite Paced by senior Rohann Asfaw, the UVa men\u2019s cross country team won the Wolfpack Invite on Wednesday. The women\u2019s team finished in third of the three teams competing at the event. On the men\u2019s side, all five UVa scoring runners placed in the top 10 at the meet. For the second time this fall, Asfaw won the 8K race, finishing in 23 minutes and 32 seconds. His teammates all crossed the finish line within 24 minutes and five seconds, placing fifth, sixth, seventh and ninth. \u201cGreat job for Rohann,\u201d Virginia director of track and field and cross country Vin Lananna said in a statement. \u201cThe team packed up quite well. N.C. State has a formidable team with a Hall of Fame coach at the helm. We are getting better each week.\u201d The Cavaliers beat N.C. State, UNC and Duke. The men\u2019s team also won the Virginia Invite to open its season. The Cavaliers placed first out of three teams at that late September event. On the women\u2019s side, Kiera Bothwell paced the Wahoos. She finished fifth in the 5K race, while senior Hannah Moran finished sixth. The team finished last behind N.C. State and UNC, respectively. \u201cGlad to measure the progress that our women\u2019s team has made since its return to Grounds,\u201d Lananna said. \u201cIt was a strong effort for the Virginia team against two very good rivals. We are proud of both teams.\u201d The women\u2019s team placed second out of three teams in the Virginia Invite, its first event of the fall. The Cavaliers wrap up their fall regular season, which consists of three meets, on Oct. 16. The Wahoos will compete in the Virginia\/Panorama Farms Invitational next Friday. The ACC Championships follow on Oct. 30.","572":"The Virginia men\u2019s soccer team was supposed to take the field on Sept. 11 for an exhibition against Clemson. The game was canceled due to COVID-19 issues with Clemson\u2019s program. On Sept. 19, Virginia was set to play Syracuse in an exhibition. Another cancellation occurred. Two weeks later, George Gelnovatch\u2019s team prepared for an Oct. 3 bout at Virginia Tech. This time, the match was postponed. \u201cI have to say, it\u2019s wearing on us a little bit,\u201d Gelnovatch said. \u201cI\u2019ll be honest. First one, OK. Second one, OK. Third one, you know, these are all kind of at the midnight hour where you\u2019ve done all the preparation, you\u2019ve done everything and then the plug\u2019s pulled.\u201d Gelnovatch and the Wahoos are currently scheduled to open the season Friday at 7 p.m. when they host Louisville. Virginia\u2019s head coach shies away from sharing optimism. He knows a last-minute cancellation or postponement is possible. He\u2019s done his best to keep his team positive, but they\u2019re the only ACC men\u2019s soccer team planning to play this fall that has yet to compete. Louisville (1-2, 1-0 ACC) has played three matches and two exhibitions. \u201cWe need a game,\u201d Gelnovatch said. \u201cWe need to play. We don\u2019t even go this long in the offseason.\u201d When the exhibitions and regular season opener were canceled, Gelnovatch opted to have his team compete in 90-minute scrimmages at Kl\u00f6ckner Stadium to simulate a game. Players wear their uniforms instead of practice gear, treating the contest like a match. During those scrimmages, Gelnovatch has liked what he\u2019s seen. He\u2019s eager to see his team in a match, but he\u2019s still anxious about Friday, given the events in recent weeks. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty good,\u201d Gelnovatch said of the scrimmages. \u201cI gotta tell you, just really, really good, but this weekend our preparation, a lot of focus, everybody\u2019s getting ready, but there\u2019s this little voice in the back of your head, \u2018Does this thing get canceled too?\u2019\u201d Dealing with postponements and cancellations challenges the players, too. They want to play. By all accounts, the UVa program has done well to stay safe amid the pandemic. With issues in other programs, it\u2019s a challenge to stay focused knowing cancellations are out of their control. \u201cI\u2019m not gonna lie, it\u2019s a little tough mentally having those games canceled so close to when we\u2019re supposed to play them, but the guys have definitely done well mentally, and I think we\u2019re definitely prepared for this Friday,\u201d goalkeeper Colin Shutler said. The Cavaliers have plenty of video to watch on Louisville, given the Cardinals\u2019 three games and two exhibitions. Virginia feels well prepared for its first ACC match. While the team would much rather play games, the added practice time has allowed new faces to integrate into the roster. The Cavaliers used the extra time to implement their scheme and bring everyone up to speed on strategy. \u201cI think we\u2019ve developed a lot,\u201d Shutler said. \u201cObviously we have a good amount of new guys in from last year to this year, but from this extended preseason time I think it\u2019s allowed us to kind of get everyone situated and knowledgeable about our game that we want to do as a team.\u201d Shutler also added that typically, cancellations mean players miss extended time. For UVa, it\u2019s been the opponent with COVID-19 issues. Despite missing games, the Cavaliers can still practice with a full roster because their athletes have largely avoided contracting the virus. Gelnovatch credits strict protocols for current success avoiding COVID-19. \u201cWe\u2019re taking measures above and beyond the protocols that are already strict,\u201d Gelnovatch said. \u201cWe take even stricter ones. For example, we don\u2019t even use our locker room. We don\u2019t meet indoors at all. Any type of meeting or video, everything is outside. The guys are changing in their car, they\u2019re changing at home. They\u2019re not changing in the locker room. We\u2019ve made a lot of sacrifices.\u201d Unfortunately, the sacrifices have yet to lead to Virginia taking the field. The Wahoos are hopeful their six-game fall regular season starts Friday. Despite a string of frustrating cancellations and postponements, the Cavaliers know they\u2019re close to actually taking the pitch. \u201cWe could go from zero games to three in nine days,\u201d Gelnovatch said. \u201cWe\u2019re scheduled to play Friday, Wednesday, Sunday next week. That\u2019s half of our remaining games in nine days. They can come fast, you just gotta be ready. All we can do is stay steady.\u201d","573":"The Virginia men\u2019s soccer team desperately wanted to play a match. After a pair of postponed scrimmages and a canceled regular season match due to COVID-19 issues affecting opposing teams, the Cavaliers finally played Friday, and they received plenty of playing time. In its first game back after a long layoff, UVa battled Louisville late into the night. It took double overtime, but the Cavaliers (1-0, 1-0 ACC) won their first match back on the pitch 2-1 over the Cardinals (1-3, 1-1 ACC). \u201cHey, listen, we came out of this with three points,\u201d Virginia head coach George Gelnovatch said. \u201cWe did not deserve it, to be honest with you, but we got fitness out of it. We\u2019re gonna get a little sharper by playing this game. It meant something. It\u2019s just gonna help us, and then the fact that we got three points probably when we shouldn\u2019t have, tells me a little something about this team.\u201d Philip Horton\u2019s penalty kick goal pushed the Wahoos over the top in the second overtime. The shot came against freshman goalkeeper Osmar Chevero, who had to take over for starting goalie Jake Gelnovatch, the son of UVa\u2019s head coach. Jake Gelnovatch argued the call that led to the penalty kick and earned a red card. It was chaotic for just about everyone. Well, except for Horton. \u201cHonestly, I didn\u2019t even know there was a red card,\u201d Horton said. \u201cI thought they brought the goalie in to try to save the PK. I didn\u2019t notice it, just tried to focus.\u201d Excellent focus helped Horton cap off a night of ups and downs for a Virginia team featuring plenty of new faces after last season\u2019s run to the national championship match. The Cavaliers appeared rusty in the opening half. Louisville moved goalkeeper Colin Shutler out of position, setting up an empty goal for Louisville\u2019s Carlos Sanchis in the first 10 minutes. Unfortunately for the Cardinals, Sanchis smacked the ball over the crossbar. Crisis averted for UVa. A handful of minutes later, Shutler came up in the box and made an impressive save. The Cardinals nearly scored again in the 18th minute, but the shot missed to the right. Eventually, UVa settled into the match. George Gelnovatch\u2019s team showed glimpses of the strategy that worked well last season, controlling possession and looking for the right time to attack. The increased possession helped the Wahoos enter halftime with the match tied at zero despite a slow start. Virginia looked like a different squad to open the second half. The Cavaliers started to connect on passes, pressuring Louisville and forcing the Cardinals to make smart defensive plays. A series of passes led to the first goal of the night. Redshirt freshman Isaiah Byrd fed a pass on the right side into graduate student Joan Gibert. The newcomer from Spain spun around before dishing the ball into Nathaniel Crofts in the box. Crofts ripped a shot past Jake Gelnovatch to give UVa a 1-0 lead. On a night with many new faces contributing, a familiar one scored the goal. The passes that led to the goal, however, came from newcomers. \u201cTo be honest, not a lot of great performances,\u201d George Gelnovatch said of the newcomers. \u201cAgain, because of the lack of games and sharpness.\u201d UVa\u2019s head coach added that he feels the team is \u201cyoung and talented\u201d and just needs more games to show more consistent excellence throughout a match. The lead created by Crofts\u2019 goal would be threatened multiple times by the Cardinals. A shot in the 67th minute from Ayden Nocus seemed destined to tie the game. He came in from the left side with Shutler on the right side of the goal, but UVa\u2019s goalkeeper jumped back toward the middle and stopped the low shot. Shutler added another save to his tally in the 72nd minute, this time diving to his left to knock a shot from Pedro Fonesca aside. Unfortunately for the Wahoos, Fonesca found the back of the net later in the match. With UVa nearly ending the night with a victory, Fonesca put the ball in the upper left corner of the net from the right side of the box with just 45 seconds remaining. Fonesca\u2019s goal sent the game into overtime. Neither team found the net in the first overtime, but the Cardinals came close on numerous occasions early in the second extra period. Shutler and the defense turned aside a few decent chances. Eventually, however, it was Virginia that earned the best shot of the overtime. The Cavaliers earned a penalty kick on a Louisville foul in the box. The call infuriated Jake Gelnovatch, who earned a red card for arguing. UVa\u2019s Horton took advantage of the new goalkeeper and the prime scoring chance, pushing the ball into the bottom right side of the net. \u201cIt\u2019s never an easy situation to be in,\u201d George Gelnovatch said. \u201cGolden goal, sudden death in overtime, emotions flying on both sides, red card and to make the penalty, I give him a lot of credit for taking it and making it.\u201d It wasn\u2019t easy, nor was it perfect, but after a long time away, it was soccer and it was a win for the Wahoos.","574":"Virginia entered Saturday\u2019s matchup with North Carolina State as an eight-point favorite. The Cavaliers left Scott Stadium 1-2 in the ACC after falling 38-21 to the Wolfpack (3-1, 3-1 ACC), who outplayed the Wahoos all afternoon. Mistakes were aplenty, and the Cavaliers were unable to recover from a slow start this week. A 24-0 deficit turned into a disappointing defeat on a rainy Saturday. Virginia lost to N.C. State by 17 points. The Wolfpack tallied 17 points off four turnovers, while the Wahoos were unable to turn their one forced turnover into points. Turnovers were the difference in Saturday\u2019s game. Other Virginia miscues included a blocked punt and a failed fourth-down attempt at the goal line. \u201cRather than making it more than that \u2026 those six plays in and of themselves were the difference in the game,\u201d Mendenhall said. UVa made far too many mistakes to beat a team as talented as N.C. State. The Cavaliers failed to convert their third downs as well, finishing the game 4-for-18 when facing third downs. Turnovers and third-down conversions tend to determine outcomes of games, and the Wahoos struggled in both aspects Saturday. Whose havoc? After opening the season with a five-sack, seven-turnover performance against Duke the defense hasn\u2019t created chaos. UVa forced one turnover against N.C. State, and the Cavaliers didn\u2019t create a single sack. The team didn\u2019t force any turnovers against Clemson. Virginia feasted on a subpar Duke offense, but they\u2019ve been going hungry ever since. \u201cWe gotta be more effective in the pass rush game, as a d-line and as a front seven, too,\u201d sixth-year defensive lineman Richard Burney said. \u201cWe gotta be better.\u201d Through three games, dynamic linebacker Charles Snowden has yet to record a sack. He finished with five a season ago. Virginia\u2019s defense believes it\u2019s capable of disrupting offenses and changing games. It\u2019s struggled in the second and third games of the season to make enough plays to keep the game competitive. Expect increased defensive disruption to be a point of emphasis in future weeks. QB update Stepping into a game as backup quarterback is never easy. Stepping in on a rainy Saturday with your team down 24-0 might be one of the tougher scenarios facing a quarterback. That\u2019s what Lindell Stone faced Saturday. While the senior signal caller was far from perfect, he finished 30-of-54 for 240 yards and three touchdowns. The former Woodberry Forest star threw one interception on the afternoon. Virginia\u2019s performance across the board fell well short of UVa\u2019s standards, but Stone held his own in relief of Armstrong, who left the game after a vicious collision on the sideline left him woozy. \u201cI was just told that Brennan was out for the game,\u201d Mendenhall said. \u201cI don\u2019t know any more information at this point. I thought Lindell did a really nice job of leading our team and giving us a chance to fight back and to possibly change the outcome and to come from behind. He did a really nice job, showed a lot of courage, a lot of grit and saw the field well.\u201d Stone wasn\u2019t as complimentary of his own performance. \u201cI think I left a lot out there, put our defense in bad positions,\u201d Stone said. \u201cI thought we moved the ball effectively at some points, but there was a lot more that could\u2019ve been done.\u201d The right-handed quarterback says he\u2019s looking forward to owning his mistakes Saturday and working to improve his game. Even with a goal of improving, Stone improved dramatically on his previous performance. Entering Saturday, Stone was just 4-of-12 for 31 yards and three interceptions in his Virginia career. He stepped up and showed improvement Saturday. COVID-19 and injury update Just like last week at Clemson, seven UVa players were unavailable for competition due to COVID-19. There were no new positives from last week, however. The student-athletes who tested positive for COVID-19 or were deemed close contacts to people who tested positive are either in isolation or quarantine. People who test positive must isolate for a minimum of 10 days, while close contacts quarantine for two weeks. None of the players affected were starters. On the injury side of things, Joey Blount missed the game for UVa. Mendenhall says Blount was ruled out late in the week, but he offered no specifics on his situation. Tavares Kelly Jr. also didn\u2019t play for the Cavaliers. He missed last week\u2019s game as well.","575":"There were seven additional positive COVID-19 tests recorded by the University of Virginia athletics department last week, the school announced Monday. The seven positives came from 1,098 tests administered. The results come from the tests given from Oct. 5-11. The football team had seven players unavailable for competition this Saturday, which was the same number missing for its Oct. 3 game at Clemson. According to the football program\u2019s Saturday news release, however, there were no additional positive tests recorded between the Clemson and N.C. State games by football players. Since testing began on July 5, the UVa athletics department has administered 7,102 tests with 83 positive test results. That\u2019s a positivity rate of 1.2%. Student-athletes or coaches who test positive for COVID-19 must self-isolate for a minimum of 10 days based on local health guidelines. Those who are deemed close contacts to people who test positive are required to self-quarantine for 14 days. While there\u2019s no sport-by-sport breakdown of positive test results, the UVa women\u2019s soccer and volleyball teams both altered schedules last week due to a combination of injuries and COVID-19 issues. Both programs are expected to return to action this week. The volleyball team travels to Virginia Tech for Friday and Sunday matches, while the women\u2019s soccer program hosts Louisville on Thursday night.","576":"Playing college sports in 2020 requires patience and discipline. Programs face daily challenges due to COVID-19, and Virginia\u2019s Olympic sports programs are among those affected by the virus. The men\u2019s soccer team saw multiple events postponed or canceled due to opponents dealing with COVID-19 issues. Despite staving off the virus, the soccer program watched as other schools struggled and games were canceled. Virginia\u2019s volleyball program has dealt with COVID-19 and injury issues itself, leading to schedule changes. The same applied to the UVa women\u2019s soccer team, which canceled last week\u2019s match with North Carolina due to COVID-19 issues and injuries. \u201cWe\u2019re doing all we can to keep the team together, to keep the team playing and being safe at the same time, but there\u2019s a lot that goes into that,\u201d women\u2019s soccer head coach Steve Swanson said. \u201cAn awful lot.\u201d Swanson is quick to credit the coaching and training staff for help in putting the Cavaliers on the field. They\u2019ve battled both injuries and the virus this fall, and they\u2019re doing what they can to safely finish a fall season. The Cavaliers expect to play Thursday night against Louisville. \u201cWe won\u2019t be our full roster, but we\u2019ll be better than we were, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d Swanson said. Virginia enters the game 4-1-1 on the season with a 2-1-1 mark in ACC contests. It hasn\u2019t played since an Oct. 4 win over Miami. \u201cYour priorities used to be, \u2018OK, who\u2019s our next opponent and how can we prepare for that?\u2019\u201d Swanson said. \u201cYour daily is, \u2018OK, our opponent is COVID, how do we first mitigate all that?\u2019 And then it\u2019s about, \u2018OK, how can we prepare the team the best way we can?\u2019\u201d Swanson\u2019s first focus every day is keeping the virus away from his squad. He\u2019s hoping the strict protocols and emphasis on staying healthy will carry the team the rest of the way. With several key players like Alexa Spaanstra and Sydney Zandi missing time due to injuries, the Cavaliers have been shorthanded at times this fall. Any potential COVID-19 outbreaks only make it more challenging for the Wahoos to take the field. Like every college team this fall, they\u2019re facing unusual challenges just to make it to game day. Field hockey match postponed The Virginia field hockey team was slated to play at Boston College on Sunday. That match was postponed Tuesday due to a \u201clack of available Boston College players due to COVID-19 related issues,\u201d according to a release from UVa. This means the Wahoos aren\u2019t scheduled to play again until Oct. 23, when they host Louisville. The Cavaliers host the Cardinals on Oct. 24 as well, and then play Oct. 31 at Duke. No date was announced for a potential rescheduled game against Boston College. Through six games this fall UVa is 3-3. The Cavaliers are 2-1 in games that count as conference matches. They lost twice to North Carolina in their most recent action. Virginia hopes to use the extended break to improve its play and correct mistakes from the UNC losses before hosting Louisville. The Cavaliers did show improvement in the second loss to UNC, only falling 2-1 after a 5-1 loss the day before. \u201cI am so proud of the team\u2019s determination to bounce back and play UVa hockey,\u201d head coach Michele Madison said in a statement after the Monday defeat. \u201cEven though this team is too good to ever settle for a loss, we are proud of our work today. It is impressive to me that we could come back, in back-to-back games and make the adjustments \u2026 against a very talented UNC team.\u201d Men\u2019s soccer match rescheduled The Virginia men\u2019s soccer program was scheduled to face Pittsburgh on Friday night. The program announced Tuesday the game will be moved to Sunday night at 7:30 p.m. in Charlottesville. Instead of airing on the ACC Network, the game can be streamed on ACC Network Extra. No official reason was given for the schedule change. The men\u2019s soccer program is scheduled to face Virginia Tech on Wednesday night at 8 p.m. The schedule shifts allows the Cavaliers to rest for a few days rather than only giving the team one day off between contests. UVa\u2019s Wednesday match against the Hokies was originally scheduled for Oct. 3, but the game was postponed. It\u2019s been a challenging season for the Cavaliers, which saw a match and two exhibitions postponed due to COVID-19 issues. They finally played a game on Oct. 9, beating Louisville 2-1 in double overtime to open the season with a victory. Virginia has five matches left in its fall regular season.","577":"There were seven ACC matchups last weekend. Six were decided by at least 10 points. Fans were treated to a thriller between Boston College and Pittsburgh, but the other seven games lacked the same intrigue. Virginia Tech, which fell by 11 to North Carolina, put up an impressive fight despite numerous players out due to COVID-19, but there were times when the game was close to a North Carolina blowout. Miami didn\u2019t put up much of a fight at all in its 42-17 loss to Clemson. Dabo Swinney\u2019s team is the clear-cut No. 1 team in the league for another week, and it\u2019s not all that close. Let\u2019s hope this week brings a few more competitive matchups. 1. Clemson (4-0, 3-0 ACC, No. 1 last week) Clemson thwarted Miami last Saturday, showing that the Hurricanes are far from being an ACC title contender. The Hurricanes\u2019 up-tempo offense stalled, and Trevor Lawrence and Travis Etienne bullied the Miami defense in the 42-17 victory. The Tigers are the best team in college football until proven otherwise. Up next: at Georgia Tech, Saturday, noon 2. North Carolina (3-0, 3-0 ACC, No. 5 last week) Take a bow, Sam Howell. North Carolina\u2019s sophomore quarterback shredded a depleted Virginia Tech secondary, completing 18 of his 23 passes for 257 yards and three touchdowns in a 56-45 win. Don\u2019t forget about Michael Carter, who rushed for 214 yards and a pair of touchdowns on just 17 carries. If UNC can play more consistently on defense, the Tar Heels could push Clemson in the ACC title game should they qualify. Up next: at Florida State, Saturday, 7:30 p.m. 3. Notre Dame (3-0, 2-0 ACC, No. 2 last week) Unsurprisingly, the Fighting Irish moved the ball well against Florida State in a 42-26 victory. Notre Dame was far from perfect, especially on defense, but it rushed for 353 yards and four touchdowns after a long COVID-19 related layoff. That\u2019ll work. Up next: vs. Louisville, Saturday, 2:30 p.m. 4. Virginia Tech (2-1, 2-1 ACC, No. 4 last week) The Hokies\u2019 win over N.C. State looks better each week, and the team rallied to nearly shock North Carolina on Saturday. Given the personnel losses related to COVID-19, we\u2019ve yet to witness a fully healthy Virginia Tech team. When the Hokies return everyone and play a full roster, they might be the second-best team in the conference. The schedule sets up beautifully for Virginia Tech to be in the mix come November. Up next: vs. Boston College, Saturday, 8 p.m. 5. Miami (3-1, 2-1 ACC, No. 3 last week) Fortunately, we can stop with the Miami hype for a week. The Hurricanes, which have played well this fall, were demolished by Clemson, losing 42-17. D\u2019Eriq King threw for just 121 yards while tossing a pair of interceptions. The performance effectively ended the Heisman campaign some media pundits said King was building. Up next: vs. Pittsburgh, Saturday, noon 6. N.C. State (3-1, 3-1 ACC, No. 7 last week) The Wolfpack forced four Virginia turnovers and jumped out to a 24-0 lead in their 38-21 road victory over the Cavaliers. Devin Leary only completed 11 passes, but N.C. State added 101 rushing yards from Zonovan Knight to cruise by Bronco Mendenhall and company. The Wolfpack are sneaky good. Up next: vs. Duke, Saturday, 3:30 p.m. 7. Boston College (3-1, 2-1 ACC, No. 9 last week) Jeff Hafley deserves credit for leading Boston College to a 3-1 start. The Eagles are a competitive group with a shockingly effective passing attack. Phil Jurkovec posted his second consecutive 300-yard passing performance in a 31-30 overtime win over Pitt. He\u2019s thrown for at least 300 yards in all three of Boston College\u2019s ACC games this fall. Zay Flowers is an All-ACC caliber wide receiver. Up next: at Virginia Tech, Saturday, 8 p.m. 8. Pittsburgh (3-2, 2-2 ACC, No. 8 last week) Make it two heartbreaking defeats in a row for the Panthers. After N.C. State scored in the final 30 seconds to beat the Panthers by one point two weeks ago, Pitt missed an extra point in overtime to lose by one against Boston College. That\u2019s a tough couple of results. Up next: at Miami, Saturday, noon 9. Virginia (1-2, 1-2 ACC, No. 6 last week) It seemed like the Cavaliers might be destined for a 3-1 start before a fun showdown at Miami. Instead, Bronco Mendenhall\u2019s team looked more like the 2016 version of UVa in a 38-21 loss to N.C. State. The Cavaliers committed four turnovers and fell behind 24-0. Quarterback Brennan Armstrong is day-to-day this week as he recovers from a concussion. Up next: at Wake Forest, Saturday, 4 p.m. 10. Georgia Tech (2-2, 2-1 ACC, No. 13) Fighting for a full 60 minutes might come to define this Georgia Tech team. The Yellow Jackets aren\u2019t the most talented ACC team, but they erased a 21-7 deficit last Friday against Louisville, rallying for a 46-27 victory. The Yellow Jackets have two ACC wins by mid-October a year after going 2-6 in the conference. Up next: vs. Clemson, Saturday, noon 11. Wake Forest (1-2, 0-2 ACC, No. 11 last week) The Demon Deacons flew by Campbell 66-14 in their last game. Wake Forest was off last week, using a bye week to prepare for UVa. Up next: vs. Virginia, Saturday, 4 p.m. 12. Louisville (1-3, 0-3 ACC, No. 10 last week) It\u2019s hard to think of many positives for the Cardinals. They lost to Georgia Tech by 19 points despite leading by 14 late in the first half. Louisville\u2019s defense is a concern, and it faces a massive test this weekend. Up next: at Notre Dame, Saturday, 2:30 p.m. 13. Florida State (1-3, 0-3 ACC, No. 14 last week) When losing by 16 points feels like a decent showing, there\u2019s something amiss. That\u2019s the state of Florida State\u2019s program in 2020. The Seminoles lost to Notre Dame, 42-26, but they were good in the first quarter and certainly have played worse in games this season. Up next: vs. North Carolina, Saturday, 7:30 p.m. 14. Duke (1-4, 1-4 ACC, No. 15 last week) The Blue Devils won a game! It took five tries, but the Blue Devils took advantage of a bad Syracuse team to win, 38-24. Sticking to its identity, however, Duke lost the turnover margin 4-0. A total of 645 yards made up for the three fumbles and interception. Up next: at N.C. State, Saturday, 3:30 p.m. 15. Syracuse (1-3, 1-3 ACC, No. 12 last week) The Orange won the turnover battle by four and lost by 14 last week. That\u2019s a special kind of bad. Add in reports that quarterback Tommy DeVito is likely done for the season with a leg injury and things may get worse for Syracuse before they get better. They enter this week as a home underdog against Liberty. Up next: vs. Liberty, Saturday, noon","578":"After a canceled match against North Carolina last week due to COVID-19 and injury issues, the Virginia women\u2019s soccer team returns to action Thursday night. The Cavaliers host Louisville at 8 p.m. The first few weeks of the season have been challenging for the Wahoos, who have seen numerous contributors go down with injuries. Add in the daily management of COVID-19, and it\u2019s tough to always field a healthy roster. Virginia head coach Steve Swanson doesn\u2019t expect a full roster Thursday night, but they have more players available than they did a week ago, when their scheduled match with the Tar Heels was canceled. \u201cEvery team and every sport that\u2019s playing this fall is dealing with similar circumstances to what we\u2019re dealing with, and that was always going to be part of it,\u201d Swanson said. \u201cThat was the risk you took when you went about it, but I think we would all say the alternative of not playing, this is much better than that.\u201d Swanson knows there are challenges to playing this fall, but the Cavaliers will do their best to take the field as much as they can safely. When the Cavaliers play, they look good. They\u2019re 4-1-1 and 2-1-1 in the ACC this fall, winning three consecutive matches. Even with injuries piling up, Virginia beat Miami 3-0 in its latest outing. With players missing, veterans and newcomers stepped up in the 3-0 victory. Player development represents a goal for Swanson. He knows the shortened fall season is unusual, and while he wants his team to win games, he always wants to give everyone chances to compete. He knows his team will be at its best during spring contests and postseason play if players outside the upperclassmen starters see playing time. \u201cThe silver lining is I think it\u2019s been good to see some other players get their chance, get an opportunity and to see them develop and progress,\u201d Swanson said. Sophomore Lacey McCormack tallied the first goal of her UVa career in the win over the Hurricanes. In goal, the Wahoos have given redshirt freshman Cayla White some playing time this fall, and she\u2019s taken advantage of the opportunity. White has logged 166 minutes across two games, and she\u2019s yet to allow a goal. She\u2019s made six saves. Virginia expects a challenge Thursday from a good Louisville team. The Cardinals are 3-1 overall and in the ACC this fall. They\u2019ve outscored opponents 8-1 this season, posting three shutout victories. \u201cWe\u2019re going to need strong performances again from the players that are available in order for us to get a win,\u201d Swanson said. \u201cIt\u2019ll be a difficult game.\u201d The difficult game comes during a difficult season. It\u2019s been a challenging few months for all athletic programs, and the women\u2019s soccer program has dealt with a series of unfortunate injuries this fall. Coupled with the pandemic, it\u2019s been a challenge. \u201cIt\u2019s been interesting, it\u2019s been very challenging, but I think there are silver linings in all things,\u201d Swanson said. \u201cI think it\u2019s brought our team closer together in many ways, even though we can\u2019t interact like we normally can. We\u2019ve had to be more resilient. We\u2019ve had to have a stronger mentality.\u201d Swanson and the Wahoos try to find positives during the struggles, and they\u2019re hopeful they can add another win to their resume Thursday night after over a week away from competition.","579":"Wednesday was a busy day in college sports, especially for Virginia fans. Football transfer Ronnie Walker Jr. had his waiver approved, granting him immediate eligibility for the Wahoos, but that storyline wasn\u2019t even the most impactful of the day as the NCAA announced important news Wednesday evening regarding both eligibility and transfers. Several pieces of additional NCAA news also came out, including news that UVa would host the 2023 cross country championships. Let\u2019s recap the busy day in collegiate sports. NCAA Division I council shares news The NCAA\u2019s Division I council announced a few pieces of news Wednesday. The council created a proposal to allow Division I student-athletes the ability to transfer once during their college careers without have to sit out for a season. The council will vote on the measure in January. If approved, players could transfer and play immediately starting in the 2021-22 athletic year. For example, in future seasons if the proposal is approved, players like UVa\u2019s Sam Hauser would not have had to sit out after transferring from Marquette. Another January vote will take place around name, image and likeness measures. The Division I council proposed that student-athletes can use their name, image and likeness to promote camps, clinics and products. Student-athletes can also be paid for autographs and personal appearances, under the proposed measures. Those changes could drastically alter the college sports landscape, should they be adopted in January. The council also officially announced that winter sport athletes competing in 2020-21 will receive an additional season of competition and an additional year to compete in it. This extends the same eligibility relief applied to spring sport athletes earlier this year. For example, current senior basketball players can opt to compete this season and next without exhausting their eligibility this winter. It is, however, up to each individual school as to how they\u2019ll handle paying for scholarships and other logistical challenges. \u201cThe pandemic will continue to impact winter sport seasons in ways we can\u2019t preduct,\u201d M. Grace Calhoun, council chair and athletics director at Penn, said. \u201cCouncil members opted to provide for winter sport student-athletes the same flexibility given spring and fall sports previously. The actions today ensure the continuation of local decision-making in the best interest of each institution and its student-athletes.\u201d Additioanlly, the council shared that every FBS program will be eligible for bowl games this postseason. Typically, teams need to win at least 50% of their games to qualify for a bowl, but that rule has been waived for this season. That means Virginia, even if it finishes the season with a losing record, will qualify for a bowl game. UVa to host 2023 cross country championships The NCAA announced host sites for a few future championships, and UVa will host the NCAA Division I men\u2019s and women\u2019s cross country championships in 2023. The event will take place at Panorama Farms in Earlysville. It\u2019s the second time the Cavaliers will host the event. The 1987 NCAA championships were held at the Foxfield Course. Panorama Farms has hosted numerous NCAA regionals, and it will soon have a chance to host the national championships. \u201cWe are honored to be selected to serve as the host institution for the Division I men\u2019s and women\u2019s cross country championships,\u201d Virginia director of track and field and cross country Vin Lananna said in a statement. \u201cWe look forward to collaborating with the NCAA Sports Committee, the staff and this vibrant running community as we welcome the outstanding women and men student-athletes, their coaches and families to Charlottesville.\u201d UVa volleyball reschedules match The Virginia volleyball team announced that a match against Duke postponed earlier this month due to COVID-19 and injuries will be moved to Oct. 30. The match, originally slated to be played in Charlottesville, will occur on Oct. 30 in Durham, North Carolina. Currently, that match will conclude UVa\u2019s regular season. UVa still has a pair of postponements against North Carolina to reschedule, though. The Cavaliers were supposed to play the Tar Heels on Oct. 9 and 11, but the games were postponed due to injuries and COVID-19. The program has yet to announce a new date for those contests. Oluwatimi on Rimington watch list UVa center Olusegun Oluwatimi was named to the 2020 Rimington Trophy Watch List on Wednesday. The award goes to the nation\u2019s most outstanding center. Oluwatimi allowed zero sacks a season ago when blocking for Bryce Perkins. According to UVa, Oluwatimi has tallied seven pancake blocks in one-on-one situations this fall. He\u2019s one of the linemen on a unit that UVa\u2019s current coaching staff believes is the best offensive line since Bronco Mendenhall arrived in Charlottesville. The Cavaliers are experienced up front, and Oluwatimi is one of the more productive players along the offensive line. The honor is named after Dave Rimington, a former All-American center for Nebraska. Men\u2019s basketball practice begins Tony Bennett and the reigning national champion UVa men\u2019s basketball team took the court Wednesday for the team\u2019s first official practice. The NCAA basketball season is scheduled to begin on Nov. 25, while UVa\u2019s official schedule has yet to be released. It\u2019s unclear how COVID-19 may affect both nonconference and ACC scheduling. \u201cIt\u2019s a GREAT day to be a Wahoo!\u201d associate head coach Jason Williford tweeted Wednesday. \u201c1st day of practice.\u201d There\u2019s plenty of reason for Williford and company to be excited this season. The Cavaliers return point guard Kihei Clark and center Jay Huff. They\u2019re joined by Marquette transfer Sam Hauser, who redshirted last season. Other notable returners include guards Casey Morsell and Tomas Woldetensae as well as forward Justin McKoy, who teammates and coaches expect to see playing an increased role this season.","580":"Alexa Spaanstra went nearly a month without playing soccer due to an injury. She made up for lost time Thursday night, seamlessly rejoining her Virginia teammates on the pitch. The UVa women\u2019s soccer team defeated Louisville 2-0 thanks to a pair of nifty goals from Spaanstra. It\u2019s Virginia\u2019s fourth consecutive victory. The junior started the scoring in the 24th minute when she took a pass from Alissa Gorzak and knocked it into the top left corner of the net. She added to her tally 10 minutes later when the Cavaliers (5-1-1, 3-1-1 ACC) drew a foul in the box. Spaanstra received the penalty kick and finished in the upper middle portion of the net. \u201cIt felt amazing, obviously, to be back,\u201d Spaanstra said with a smile painted across her face. \u201cIt was a lot of fun just being able to play with them. They make me look good.\u201d Virginia head coach Steve Swanson speaks often this season about finding silver linings during a challenging year filled with new protocols due to COVID-19 and an NCAA Tournament not taking place until the spring. The Cavaliers have watched some of their top contributors miss time with injuries this season, but they found plenty of on-field positives Thursday. Spaanstra looked like her usual self upon returning from injury. She played 71 minutes, looking like one of the fastest and most dynamic players on the field. Redshirt freshman Cayla White earned the start in goal, once again performing well. Thursday marked the third match of White\u2019s young career and she once again held the opponent without a goal. She\u2019s played 256 minutes for the Cavaliers this season, tallying eight saves and not yet allowing a goal. UVa\u2019s first half was particularly dominant, and White wasn\u2019t needed much to open the game. The Wahoos held Louisville (3-2, 3-2 ACC) without a shot for the duration of the first 45 minutes. The second half wasn\u2019t much different. While the Cardinals were able to manufacture two shots, the Cavaliers controlled possession for the majority of the half. They failed to add a third goal\u00a0\u2014 and a near-goal from Diana Ordonez was taken away due to an offside call\u00a0\u2014 but the Cavaliers looked like the far superior team. UVa ended the night with a 24-2 shots advantage. Starting goalkeeper Laurel Ivory didn\u2019t play, but the shutout never seemed in doubt. White did well to remain engaged throughout the match despite limited action on her side of the field. It was a complete team effort for the Cavaliers. \u201cI thought our defending was quite good as well to limit their counter and their set plays and things like that to a couple chances,\u201d Swanson said. \u201cThat was a good result for us and a pretty good performance overall.\u201d A recent cancellation due to injuries and COVID-19 related issues kept the Cavaliers off the pitch for more than a week. The team\u2019s return to competition was filled with crisp play and abundant energy. Possession belonged to the Wahoos for most of the night, and the outcome wasn\u2019t in doubt after the first 30 minutes. Despite outscoring its last two opponents 5-0, Louisville didn\u2019t have the same offensive firepower Thursday night against a stout UVa defense. As the Cavaliers look for silver linings amid a challenging season, they\u2019ll be hard pressed to find any negatives from Thursday\u2019s showing. \u201cReally happy with the win,\u201d Swanson said.","581":"WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. \u2014 A slow start and a woeful finish bookended a respectable second and third quarters for the Virginia football team Saturday. The Wahoos fell to Wake Forest 40-23 despite outscoring the Demon Deacons 17-9 across the middle two quarters. Virginia falls to 1-3 on the season with the loss, losing three consecutive games for the first time since the end of the 2017 season. The schedule won\u2019t get any easier as ranked Miami and North Carolina teams arrive next for the Wahoos. Saturday\u2019s effort wasn\u2019t nearly good enough to beat a ranked team, and it wasn\u2019t even enough to stay within 10 points of a Wake Forest team (2-2, 1-2 ACC) that entered the night winless in the ACC. \u201cWe all know we know we got to put our noses down and get to work and get this culture back where it needs to be,\u201d sophomore defensive tackle Jowon Briggs said. There were a few building blocks for the Cavaliers, however. UVa opted to use three quarterbacks Saturday. Lindell Stone earned the start with Brennan Armstrong injured. Given Stone\u2019s lack of rushing ability, the Cavaliers used both Keytaon Thompson and Iraken Armstead as runners. The decision to utilize three quarterbacks sparked the rushing attack. For the first time since Oct. 27, 2018, Virginia eclipsed 200 rushing yards in an ACC game. The Cavaliers finished the game with 218 yards on the ground. Armstead and Thompson accounted for 117 of the 218 yards. Armstead also completed a pass for nine yards. He threw the ball three times. \u201cIt was pretty smooth, actually, and we had practiced it and walked through it,\u201d Thompson said of the revolving door at the quarterback position. Running back Wayne Taulapapa chipped in with 68 yards and a touchdown. Rushing wasn\u2019t a major issue for the Wahoos on Saturday. At many times during the game, it was the team\u2019s best offensive threat. Unfortunately for Virginia, the offense only mustered three points in the second half. Despite a subpar second half, the three-quarterback system showed surprising promise. Up and down special teams play It was far from perfect, but the Virginia special teams unit showed moments of improved play. At other moments, mistakes put the Cavaliers in unfortunate situations. Brian Delaney made three of his four field goal attempts. He also missed a 36-yard kick that would\u2019ve given UVa a 23-20 lead in the third quarter. Tavares Kelly Jr. showed flashes on kickoff returns, taking two kicks for a combined 65 yards as he returned from injury. Unfortunately, when the Demon Deacons elected to kick away from Kelly Jr. in the fourth quarter, sophomore running back Perris Jones fumbled the kickoff and the Demon Deacons recovered. Wake Forest turned the miscue into a touchdown and a 14-point lead. The Cavaliers made a few solid plays on special teams, but the game-altering miscues remained. Slow starts continue UVa fell behind 14-0 in the first four minutes of Saturday\u2019s game. \u201cSurprised, but yeah, it\u2019s two weeks\u2019 worth now of emphasis on starting faster,\u201d head coach Bronco Mendenhall said. \u201cI still haven\u2019t designed the right answers yet to help our team start faster. Still working on it.\u201d The Cavaliers made a field goal to score their first points in a first quarter this fall, but they trailed 14-3 after 15 minutes of play. UVa has been outscored 48-3 across first quarters this fall. Big plays allowed Once again, big plays were an issue for UVa\u2019s defense. The Cavaliers allowed touchdowns of 75 and 40 yards Saturday, while yielding a handful of other chunk plays that didn\u2019t directly result in touchdowns. Wake Forest finished the night with six plays going for at least 30 yards. Wake Forest averaged seven yards per play, and Sam Hartman averaged 19 yards per completion. UVa\u2019s secondary struggled throughout the night, and Mendenhall admitted he expected the Cavaliers to have more matchup advantages in the back end. \u201cThere are always matchup assessments so a matchup we thought would be more in our favor with our safety versus the No. 2 receiver for Wake \u2014 the second receiver in \u2014 we thought that would be more in our favor,\u201d Mendenhall said. \u201cThat ended up being more in Wake\u2019s favor.\u201d To make matters worse, cornerback De\u2019Vante Cross left the game with an injury. Safeties Joey Blount and Brenton Nelson also left at times with injuries. Mendenhall is unsure of the status of the three defensive backs as the Cavaliers prepare for Miami next week. Walker sick In addition to the three defensive backs missing time, transfer running back Ronnie Walker Jr. missed the game with an illness. The Cavaliers were down one player due to COVID-19, but it\u2019s unclear if Walker Jr. was that player. The running back received his waiver from the NCAA this week, but developed an illness as the week went on and was unable to play for UVa despite being allowed to suit up this week. \u201cJust as the waiver comes in, he was out of practice that day and not feeling well,\u201d Mendenhall said. \u201cHe\u2019s out with sickness currently.\u201d","582":"The clock ran out on Virginia\u2019s road effort against Wake Forest, and the scoreboard didn\u2019t paint a pretty picture for the Wahoos. It was another loss, the team\u2019s third straight defeat. This one came by a final score of 40-23 against the Demon Deacons. A defense poised to be one of the best in the ACC this fall faltered yet again, allowing 483 yards of offense and 40 points. Internally, the players want to take the season-long journey day-by-day. Externally, fans can\u2019t help but peek at the schedule. UVa (1-3, 1-3 ACC) heads to Miami next weekend to face a dynamic offense slowed this season only by the mighty Clemson Tigers. A week later, the Cavaliers face a North Carolina team coming off an ugly loss to Florida State, yet it still sports one of the most dynamic passing attacks in college football. One week after that, Virginia hosts a dangerous Louisville team that lost to Notre Dame in South Bend by just five points Saturday. As Virginia fans look at the schedule, they see a potential 1-5 or even 1-6 start heading into the team\u2019s bye week. Those fans should consider the big picture when evaluating Virginia football this fall. The Cavaliers lost Bryce Perkins, one of the most productive quarterbacks in program history, to graduation. They started what amounts to their third-string quarterback Saturday. Virginia altered its offseason development significantly due to COVID-19, waiting deep into the preseason to return to somewhat normal preparation as head coach Bronco Mendenhall considered the possibility that a fall season may not ever occur. Maybe most importantly, the Wahoos don\u2019t have the usual buffer games that help a team ease into a season. UVa\u2019s original schedule featured a marquee matchup with Georgia before two extremely winnable games against VMI and UConn. Instead, the Cavaliers opened the season with four ACC games. This year\u2019s schedule is undoubtedly the most challenging of the Mendenhall era. Senior cornerback Nick Grant summed up the loss to Wake Forest well. \u201cWe had a lot better energy, a lot better focus this week,\u201d Grant said. \u201cWe just have to match that with our execution.\u201d Grant\u2019s point can appear empty, given the 17-point loss, but he\u2019s correct. After falling flat on their face against N.C. State, the Cavaliers were energetic and boisterous on the sideline. At one point, linebacker Charles Snowden called for the bench to become even more excited, and the increased noise helped lead to a Wake Forest false start. UVa played hard Saturday and remained engaged; the Wahoos just made costly mistakes yet again. After a dominant Week 1 with five forced interceptions, UVa\u2019s defense and secondary looks suspect. They\u2019re struggling and the offense lacks the firepower, especially without starting quarterback Brennan Armstrong, to compete in shootouts. The defense allowed two touchdowns of at least 40 yards Saturday, including what turned out to be the game-winning, 75-yard touchdown run. Special teams fumbled a kickoff return in the fourth quarter that led to seven Wake Forest points. Defensively, it\u2019s hard to understand the mistakes. UVa returns an experienced with group with players like Noah Taylor, Snowden and Zane Zandier at linebacker. In the secondary, Joey Blount, De\u2019Vante Cross and Brenton Nelson possess experience alongside Grant. Even sophomore nose tackle Jowon Briggs got into the action Saturday with a pair of sacks. Some of those talented individuals, especially the defensive backs, struggled at times Saturday. \u201cThe secondary is giving up too many deep passes, not playing the ball well,\u201d Mendenhall said. Wake Forest averaged nearly 20 yards per completion, crushing UVa with deep pass after deep pass. They came early in the game and late in the contest as the Cavaliers\u2019 experienced group in the back end wasn\u2019t up to the task. Blount, Cross and Nelson suffered injuries Saturday and missed portions of the game. It\u2019s unclear how much time those players may miss moving forward. Offensively, the fall quarterback competition featured Armstrong and Mississippi State transfer Keytaon Thompson. Lindell Stone, who likely would\u2019ve been the third-string quarterback entering this fall if it wasn\u2019t for Thompson battling a shoulder injury, earned the start Saturday. \u201cIt\u2019s not sustainable, but he can for a while,\u201d Mendenhall said of Thompson playing quarterback with his shoulder still banged up. In an era where quarterbacks reign supreme, Stone completed 24 of his 42 passes for 193 yards, no touchdowns and a pair of interceptions. He averaged 4.6 yards per pass attempt and just eight yards per completion. On the season, UVa is averaging nearly 50 pass attempts per game, but just 5.31 yards per pass attempt. They\u2019re allowing 8.46 yards per pass. The absence of Perkins is noticeable, especially when Armstrong has played just 2\u00bd games this fall due to his concussion. Even the absence of Thompson as a possible starting quarterback is glaring. He ran for 71 yards on 10 carries Saturday, and he caught a touchdown pass against Clemson. His play almost teases UVa faithful, showing brief flashes of what the Cavaliers could have at quarterback if his arm could handle 40 throws a game. On special teams, the Wahoos have fumbled two kickoff returns and failed to generate long, game-altering returns. Joe Reed was the most decorated returner in program history. He\u2019s gone, leaving the Cavaliers to fill his role with Taveres Kelly Jr, who missed the second and third games of the year with an injury. He played well Saturday. Virginia isn\u2019t executing the way it needs to and the Cavaliers won\u2019t make excuses for their 1-3 start. At the same time, it\u2019s impossible to ignore that they\u2019re starting their third-string quarterback a year after one of the best quarterbacks in program history led the offense. It took a creative, three-quarterback system for Virginia to move the ball effectively against Wake Forest. The execution, after a strange offseason altered by a global pandemic, is lacking in all three phases. \u201cI loved the energy and mindset,\u201d running back Wayne Taulapapa said of his offensive unit, which finished with over 400 total yards. \u201cBut we do have to execute no matter what.\u201d The sky isn\u2019t falling in Charlottesville, even if the Cavaliers\u2019 ACC title chances were dashed before Halloween. But a year after making the ACC title game, a combination of factors from offseason preparation to injuries sent the Cavaliers into an unexpected rebuilding mode. As teams like Florida State and Georgia Tech have shown this season, however, a bad loss or two doesn\u2019t define the fall. Outside of Clemson, every ACC team has shown clear weaknesses. UVa will enter many of its remaining games this season as an underdog, but they\u2019re not giving up on the year despite the rocky start. There\u2019s time yet to turn the year around. \u201cWe\u2019re having to adapt and adjust the best we can,\u201d Mendenhall said. \u201cI just want the mindset, the effort and the competitive spirit to remain, and the execution will catch up at some point. That\u2019s my message to our team.\u201d","583":"The University of Virginia athletics department administered 939 COVID-19 tests from Oct. 12-18, which resulted in four new positive test results. The testing positivity rate last week was below 1% in the results shared by the school on Monday morning. Since the UVa athletics department began testing on July 5, it has issued 8,041 COVID-19 tests and received 87 total positives. The four UVa student-athletes who tested positive last week are required to self-isolate for a minimum of 10 days as they monitor symptoms and aim to recover from the virus. Close contacts of the infected individuals must self-quarantine for two weeks, per local health guidelines. Last week, Virginia\u2019s athletic programs went through a largely uninterrupted week. The field hockey program postponed a game against Boston College due to unavailable players on the Boston College side, but Virginia\u2019s cross country, football, men\u2019s and women\u2019s soccer and volleyball programs all competed last week. UVa\u2019s football program was without one student-athlete for its game at Wake Forest on Saturday after two consecutive weeks of seven players being unavailable for competition. It\u2019s unclear if that player was one of the four new positive tests within the athletic department. While the test numbers from last week were low and postponements were limited, COVID-19 remains a potential threat to team\u2019s seasons. Field hockey, football, men\u2019s soccer and volleyball are all scheduled to compete this weekend. They\u2019ll need to get through a few more rounds of testing with no or limited positive tests to compete. They\u2019ll also need the same from their opponents.","584":"The Virginia football team enters this Saturday's matchup with Miami after a rough stretch of games. The Cavaliers (1-3, 1-3 ACC) are losers of three straight, each of the losses coming by at least 17 points. For a team that played in the ACC Championship Game a season ago, 2020 has been filled with adjustments and mistakes. Despite an iffy start, the Wahoos maintain confidence within their locker room. They believe better execution will lead to better on-field results. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s like \u2026 sad or somber or 'Woe is me,'\u201d senior linebacker Charles Snowden said. \u201cGuys are just accepting the facts, taking responsibility, acknowledging that we haven\u2019t played to the standard at which we normally would like to play it. It\u2019s all within our control and so it\u2019s not really a \u2018Woe is me,\u2019 it\u2019s like an, \u2018All right, get your hard hat. Let\u2019s get ready to work and get back to playing Virginia football.\u2019\u201d The Cavaliers need that better play immediately. They enter this weekend\u2019s contest against a rapidly improving Miami program with offensive weapons across the board. The Hurricanes are 4-1 on the season and 3-1 in the ACC with their only loss coming to No. 1 Clemson. Transfer quarterback D\u2019Eriq King brings athleticism to the quarterback position, and he\u2019s one of the league\u2019s top performers at the position. Miami ranks fourth in the ACC in scoring at 35.6 points per contest. The Hurricanes are capable of generating the explosive plays that have plagued UVa\u2019s defense through four games. \u201cWe\u2019re playing kind of the exact same as we have in years past, but big plays are just killing us, and that\u2019s kind of overshadowing the rest of the picture,\u201d Snowden said. Experience on the defense led many to believe the unit would be a strength entering this fall. After four games, Virginia ranks 14th out of 15 ACC teams in points allowed per game. The Wahoos are yielding 34.8 points per game largely due to mistakes leading to chunk plays. Virginia\u2019s defense needs to slow down Miami for the Cavaliers to have a shot of pulling the upset. Injury updates Joey Blount, De\u2019Vante Cross and Brenton Nelson were among the UVa players to suffer injuries Saturday against Wake Forest. Mendenhall didn\u2019t have a status update on the three defensive backs Monday, saying he\u2019ll likely learn more later in the week. The same goes for transfer running back Ronnie Walker Jr. and starting quarterback Brennan Armstrong. Walker became ill at the end of last week, missing the game against Wake Forest. Armstrong suffered a concussion against N.C. State and missed the Wake Forest game as a result. He\u2019s still in concussion protocol, and it\u2019s unclear when the Cavaliers may regain the services of their signal caller. \u201cWe prepare as if they will never be back, and then when they are, that\u2019s great,\u201d Mendenhall said of injured performers. Should Armstrong miss Saturday\u2019s game, the Cavaliers may go back to their three-quarterback system. They used Lindell Stone, Keytaon Thompson and Ira Armstead against Wake Forest, with Armstead and Thompson serving a role primarily as rushing options. Completely out of the AP poll For the first time since the Oct. 27 poll last season, the UVa football team has fallen completely out of the AP Top 25 poll. While the Cavaliers weren\u2019t ranked at all this fall, they had received votes every week this season. After losing to Wake Forest 40-23, the 1-3 Cavaliers didn\u2019t receive a single vote in this week\u2019s poll. \u201cI love my team,\u201d Mendenhall said. \u201cI love who they are. I love how they prepare. A handful of plays each week are what we need to make to continue to grow and improve our program.\u201d Six ACC teams earned spots in the top 25 this week, with No. 1 Clemson leading the way. Notre Dame checks in at No. 3. UVa\u2019s opponent this weekend, Miami, earned the No. 11 spot in the poll. North Carolina follows at 14th. Virginia Tech, which has battled COVID-19 related absences all season, ranks 19th. N.C. State rounds out the ACC teams in the poll at No. 23. Unfortunately for the Wolfpack, starting quarterback Devin Leary broke his fibula against Duke and is expected to miss 4-8 weeks. Up next After heading to Miami this weekend, the Cavaliers return home on Halloween to host North Carolina. The game will kick off at 8 p.m. and air on the ACC Network, the conference announced Monday. With Saturday\u2019s game against Miami also on the ACC Network, each of UVa\u2019s first six games this fall will air on the ACC Network. North Carolina enters this weekend with a 3-1 record this fall. The Tar Heels moved into the top 5 of the AP poll last weekend before suffering a disappointing road loss at Florida State. Mack Brown\u2019s team hosts N.C. State this weekend before coming to Charlottesville on Oct. 31.","585":"Virginia football fans are likely sick of the ACC power poll by now as they watch as their Cavaliers keep tumbling down the rankings. They slip again this week after a disappointing 40-23 loss to Wake Forest. Elsewhere in the commonwealth, Liberty smoked Syracuse, cementing the Orange as the worst the ACC has to offer. Virginia Tech looks the part of an ACC title contender, once again rushing the ball with ease against its opponent. If the Hokies get healthy, watch out. 1. Clemson (5-0, 4-0 ACC, No. 1 last week): The Tigers took down Georgia Tech 73-7 last week. Dabo Swinney\u2019s squad easily dispatched the Yellow Jackets, who barely put up a fight. Trevor Lawrence threw for 404 yards and five touchdowns, although he did toss an interception. That\u2019ll give the Heisman frontrunner something to work on heading into another likely blowout. Up next: vs. Syracuse, Saturday, noon 2. Notre Dame (4-0, 3-0 ACC, No. 3 last week): While the gap between Clemson and Notre Dame feels massive, the Fighting Irish are one of the few ACC teams with a fighting chance to beat the Tigers. Notre Dame looked mediocre in its 12-7 win over Louisville, but at least it won the game. That\u2019s more than North Carolina can say. Up next: at Pittsburgh, Saturday, 3:30 p.m. 3. Virginia Tech (3-1, 3-1 ACC, No. 4 last week): It would be fun to see a fully healthy Virginia Tech team. Maybe that\u2019ll happen this week? Even with players missing due to COVID-19, Khalil Herbert just keeps on running. The transfer running back sits squarely in the Heisman race after tallying 172 yards and a touchdown in a 40-14 win over Boston College. Up next: at Wake Forest, Saturday, 3:30 p.m. 4. Miami (4-1, 3-1 ACC): Aside from its loss to Clemson, Miami has looked good. The Hurricanes dispatched Pitt 31-19 over the weekend, using four touchdown passes from D\u2019Eriq King to beat the Panthers despite just 109 rushing yards on 42 attempts. The defense held strong, limiting Pitt to just 22 rushing yards. Up next: vs. Virginia, Saturday, 8 p.m. 5. North Carolina (3-1, 3-1 ACC, No. 2 last week): What a letdown. After ripping off 56 points to beat Virginia Tech, the Tar Heels stunk in a 31-28 loss to Florida State. UNC made a late push, outscoring Florida State 21-0 in the second half, but a 31-7 halftime deficit proved too large to overcome. Defense remains a concern. Up next: vs. N.C. State, Saturday, noon 6. North Carolina State (4-1, 4-1 ACC, No. 7 last week): Bad luck struck North Carolina State this past weekend. The Wolfpack beat Duke, 31-20, but quarterback Devin Leary will miss 4-8 weeks due to a leg injury. Without Leary, N.C. State takes a significant step back. Regardless, the 4-1 start is impressive. Up next: at North Carolina, Saturday, noon 7. Boston College (3-2, 2-2 ACC, No. 7 last week): A strong start to the season faded in its 40-14 loss to Virginia Tech. The Eagles allowed over 300 rushing yards in the lackluster defensive effort. The Eagles are decent, but they\u2019re not at the same level as the best teams in the league. Up next: vs. Georgia Tech, Saturday, 4 p.m. 8. Pittsburgh (3-3, 2-3 ACC, No. 8 last week): Make it three consecutive losses for the Panthers, who didn\u2019t have enough firepower to keep up with Miami in a 31-19 loss. The Panthers hope starting quarterback Kenny Pickett returns from injury soon. They need his playmaking ability. Up next: at Notre Dame, Saturday, 3:30 p.m. 9. Wake Forest (2-2, 1-2 ACC, No. 11 last week): The Demon Deacons used big plays and a pair of timely turnovers to outlast UVa 40-23 on Saturday. Sam Hartman was efficient as a passer, and Kenneth Walker III ran for more than 100 yards and three touchdowns. The Demon Deacons are a competitive group. Up next: Virginia Tech, Saturday, 3:30 p.m. 10. Georgia Tech (2-3, 2-2 ACC, No. 10 last week): Yikes. The Yellow Jackets allowed a whopping 73 points to Clemson, looking like a low-level FCS team in their 73-7 loss to the Tigers. The rebuild continues this week with a much easier test. Up next: at Boston College, Saturday, 4 p.m. 11. Florida State (2-3, 1-3 ACC, No. 13 last week): The Seminoles fought well this weekend. They\u2019ve been an ACC laughingstock for most of the season, but they jumped out to a 24-0 lead against UNC and held on for a 31-28 victory. It\u2019s a massive win for a program in need of positive results. They can build on it this week. Up next: at Louisville, Saturday, noon 12. Virginia (1-3, 1-3 ACC, No. 9 last week): Virginia needs Brennan Armstrong back and healthy. UVa misses its starting quarterback. Its three-quarterback system worked surprisingly well at times Saturday against Wake Forest, but scoring 23 points won\u2019t cut it most weeks. It definitely won\u2019t cut it with the way UVa\u2019s defense and special teams unit are currently playing. Up next: at Miami, Saturday, 8 p.m. 13. Louisville (1-4, 0-4 ACC, No. 12 last week): The Cardinals put up a fantastic battle in their 12-7 loss to Notre Dame, but once again, they came up short. Louisville returns home after three consecutive road games, and it\u2019s a favorite this week despite being 0-4 in the ACC. Up next: vs. Florida State, Saturday, noon 14. Duke (1-5, 1-5 ACC, No. 14 last week): Give credit to the Blue Devils for keeping its game with N.C. State close. They only lost by 11 points. That\u2019s not bad, considering how the program has performed this season. Up next: Bye 15. Syracuse (1-4, 1-3 ACC, No. 15 last week): Oh boy. After allowing 338 rushing yards in a 38-21 home loss to Liberty, the Orange head to Clemson to face Travis Etienne and the Tigers. Hide the kids. Up next: at Clemson, Saturday, noon","586":"It\u2019s about that time, Virginia basketball fans. Tony Bennett and the Cavaliers will take part in their elongated national title defense beginning on Nov. 25. On Wednesday, the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame and Gazelle Group announced a season-opening event that will occur at Mohegan Sun Arena in Connecticut, and the Cavaliers are one of the four teams included. It appears that Virginia will face either Maine or Saint Peter\u2019s on the first day of the season, Nov. 25. The Wahoos will then face Florida on Nov. 27. UVa last faced Florida in 2017, when the Cavaliers fell to the Gators 65-39 in the second round of the NCAA Tournament. This year\u2019s game will mark the first regular season meeting between the two teams. Virginia played Maine a season ago, winning 46-26 at John Paul Jones Arena. The teams combined to make just 25 shots from the floor. Mohegan Sun Arena will host multiple games this upcoming season, and the space is being dubbed \u201cBubbleville.\u201d Given the spread of COVID-19, the host area is expected to provide a \u201ccontrolled environment with teams and event staff adhering to tribal, government, and NCAA health and safety protocols and testing requirements,\u201d according to a press release. UVa won the Air Force Reserve Tip-Off Championship at Mohegan Sun last season. The Cavaliers beat UMass and Arizona State in Connecticut last fall to win the event. The college basketball season will look unlike anything we\u2019ve seen before, likely with limited crowds and social distancing guidelines for event staff and media. Players and coaches will frequently be tested for COVID-19. Expect a strange year. On the plus side for UVa fans, they\u2019ll have a chance to watch the Cavaliers compete against what\u2019s expected to be a competitive Florida team. There\u2019s potential for the early season game to be a top-25 matchup. Virginia enters the season with high expectations. Bennett\u2019s group returns Kihei Clark and Jay Huff from last season\u2019s 23-win team. Sam Hauser joins the fold after sitting out last season due to NCAA transfer rules, and Tomas Woldetensae and Casey Morsell add important depth to the backcourt.","587":"For more than three decades, Mike London has coached football. He believes the most common thing he shouted during practice through all those years is \u201cStay off the quarterback! Stay off the quarterback!\u201d As London\u2019s William & Mary players practiced this week, he kept shouting something different: \u201cSocial distancing! Social distancing!\u201d London tested positive for COVID-19 earlier this month. He is a 60-year-old Black man, and well aware that the virus often impacts minorities, and older minorities, to a greater extent. He knew the consequences of a positive test could be extreme, even deadly. \u201cYou test positive and you look around at what\u2019s going on in the world, what\u2019s going on regionally, locally,\u201d said London. \u201cI\u2019ve always been a glass-half-full guy, but at the same time, you start thinking about the tragedies that are happening. \u201cYour core is shaken initially. I see the devastation.\u201d The former Virginia football coach isolated at his residence for the better part of two weeks. London stayed in one room of his home. His wife and son kept away from him, and quarantined. London did not experience any serious symptoms. \u201cAs time went on, I just felt very fortunate, very blessed, to have been given the news and been able to take it and point it in the direction of, \u2018What else can I do? How else can I make not just myself, but other people, better?\u2019\u201d said London. Before testing positive, he didn\u2019t ignore mask-wearing, regular hand sanitizing, or additional health-and-safety recommendations. But since London went through the isolation and thought about other individuals who contracted COVID-19 and are hospitalized, and how that affects their families, he committed to hyper-vigilance for himself and those around him. He now shares that perspective with anybody who will listen. \u201cComing back and being able to get outside and run, share enthusiasm and excitement, and things like that \u2026\u201d London said Thursday from a W&M field just before the Tribe worked out. \u201cI\u2019m really blessed and fortunate to be out here with a coaching whistle on. \u201cAnd social-distancing. And everybody\u2019s got a mask on out here.\u201d London knows his players figured something was amiss because during Zoom calls with them, he emphasized how misfortune can occur, and the key is how one responds. \u201cThey knew I wasn\u2019t around, wasn\u2019t available,\u201d he said. The Tribe players must have also noticed that hand sanitizing lately is emphasized like never before in the W&M football program. The coach demands it. \u201cThis thing touches, as we all know, anybody. The leader of the free world, anybody,\u201d London said. \u201cYoung people are like, \u2018Well, if I get it, I\u2019ll be all right.\u2019 But when they go home, when they go to different places that involve grandparents, nieces, nephews, uncles, that makes a difference. \u201cYou just keep coaching, teaching, and hope the message resonates. I have a platform to say it, and I want to express it.\u201d","588":"Against Clemson, the Cavaliers were simply outmatched by the nation\u2019s No. 1 team. In the loss to N.C. State, poor energy, an abysmal start and an injury to starting quarterback Brennan Armstrong doomed the Cavaliers. The following week against Wake Forest, the Cavaliers couldn\u2019t overcome Armstrong\u2019s absence and they faded late in their 40-23 defeat to the Demon Deacons. Saturday\u2019s 19-14 loss to Miami felt different. Armstrong was back, and the Cavaliers held D\u2019Eriq King and a high-octane Miami offense to just 19 points. Clemson is the only other squad this fall to hold Miami to fewer than 20 points. The loss in the pouring rain to No. 11 Miami very well could\u2019ve been a win. It wasn\u2019t. \u201cI thought they played a really hard game, and they played with a lot of heart and great mindset and supported each other in probably the most physical and the most intense they played the entire year,\u201d Virginia coach Bronco Mendenhall said. \u201cYeah, so I celebrate that. I was really proud of them in terms of the effort they gave.\u201d Virginia looked like the team that beat Duke in the season opener. It looked more like a top-tier ACC team. Unfortunately for the Wahoos, the effort didn\u2019t end in a win, and the Cavaliers (1-4, 1-4 ACC) continued their slide down the ACC standings. A subpar start Virginia sits at 1-4 on the season a year after playing for an ACC championship. Linebacker Charles Snowden was visibly frustrated after the team\u2019s loss to the Hurricanes. With the team sitting at 1-4, the road won\u2019t get much easier. North Carolina comes to town next weekend after demolishing N.C. State this weekend. The following week, UVa welcomes in a Louisville team coming off its best performance of the fall in a win over Florida State. A bye week comes following those two challenging ACC matchups. The season isn\u2019t a complete loss yet, but the Cavaliers face an uphill battle to finish the year at or above .500. \u201cIt\u2019s one week at a time,\u201d Snowden said. \u201cWe\u2019re just focused on football, not looking too much at the record, not looking too much at outcomes, just focusing on the next play and the next opponent.\u201d Generating havoc A lack of pass rush hurt the Cavaliers in its three previous losses. The Cavaliers dramatically improved that area Saturday, finishing the contest with five sacks. \u201cIt is huge to cause havoc after the quarterback every play and every game,\u201d Snowden said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s something that we haven\u2019t done as well this year and so we emphasize that and executed.\u201d Snowden generated one of UVa\u2019s sacks. He finished the contest with 3.5 tackles for loss. UVa\u2019s linebackers earned credit for 3.5 of the team\u2019s five sacks. Thanks to lost yardage from sacks and generally solid production against the rushing attack, UVa held Miami to just 2.5 yards per carry on 48 rushing attempts. The Hurricanes ended the game with only 122 rushing yards. \u201cI think this defense tried hard and left everything on the field,\u201d Snowden said. \u201cI mean every guy was flying around hitting stuff, making plays. I mean there were plays obviously, one or two plays here and there, but from an effort from a heart standpoint, this whole defense can walk out with their head held high.\u201d Offensive woes After a 38-point outburst in Week 1 and a decent showing in Week 2 against Clemson, UVa\u2019s offense can\u2019t find consistency. The Cavaliers scored just 14 points Saturday despite generating 366 yards of total offense and turning the ball over just once. The turnover shows up in the stat sheet, but it only came when the Cavaliers were tossing the ball around on its final offensive play of the game in hopes of a miraculous victory. Virginia scored touchdowns on its opening drive and its second-to-last drive Saturday, but the Cavaliers failed to consistently turn yards into points. It\u2019s a bit of an emerging trend for the Cavaliers, who amassed over 400 yards against Clemson, N.C. State and Wake Forest, but fell short of scoring 24 points in those three losses. \u201cI think we moved the ball,\u201d Armstrong said. \u201cWe pitched and [caught] pretty well. We ran the ball well. And we just shot ourselves in the foot to be honest with you.\u201d The lack of finished drives perplexed the Wahoos, who felt confident throughout the night that they could turn a close game into a victory. Instead, they failed to score until late in the fourth quarter with the game nearly out of reach. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t demoralizing at all,\u201d Armstrong said of the gap between touchdowns. \u201cEveryone was positive, just moving around ready to go because we knew we were going to score. It just didn\u2019t come.\u201d UVa player availability Four Virginia players were unavailable for competition due to recent COVID-19 testing, the program announced before Saturday\u2019s game with Miami. This marks the fourth consecutive game the Cavaliers had players unavailable for competition due to the virus and subsequent contact tracing protocols. Seven UVa student-athletes and a coach missed the team\u2019s matchup with Clemson. Seven players missed the game against N.C. State. Only one player missed last week\u2019s game against Wake Forest, and four players missed Saturday\u2019s contest with the Hurricanes. Lavel Davis Jr. and Ronnie Walker Jr. didn\u2019t play for the Wahoos on offense, although no official reason was given for their absence. Walker Jr. missed the Wake Forest game with an undisclosed illness. Defensively, Joey Blount and Brenton Nelson didn\u2019t suit up for the Cavaliers. They dealt with injuries last week against Wake Forest.","589":"On Monday, the Virginia athletics department reported two new positive COVID-19 test results from the 985 tests administered from Oct. 19-25. The positivity test rate from that weekly round of testing sits at 0.2%. Since testing began on July 5, UVa athletics has administered a total of 9,026 tests. Of those tests, 89 came back positive. That test positivity rate checks in at 1%. Student-athletes and staff members who test positive for the virus must self-isolate for a minimum of 10 days as they monitor symptoms and recover from COVID-19. Close contacts of those who test positive must self-quarantine for 14 days. This two-week quarantine period is designed to last through the potential incubation period of the virus, helping to ensure close contacts don\u2019t unknowingly spread the virus to others. While UVa does not share a sport-by-sport breakdown of positive test results, four UVa football players were unavailable for competition this past weekend against Miami. It was the fourth consecutive game with at least one UVa football player unavailable for competition due to COVID-19. The Cavaliers were without seven players and a coach against Clemson before missing seven players against N.C. State. UVa was only without one student-athlete against Wake Forest the week before facing Miami. Several other Virginia athletic programs were forced to postpone or cancel events earlier this fall due to the virus, but competitions this past weekend were unaffected. The Cavaliers\u2019 field hockey, men\u2019s soccer, volleyball and football programs all competed this weekend.","590":"The Virginia baseball team fell short of the NCAA Tournament in both 2018 and 2019. The Cavaliers seemed destined for a return to the postseason in 2020, but a global pandemic had other plans. Instead of finishing out a promising spring, the Cavaliers were forced to head home, finishing classes online and losing out on the season. In the aftermath of the canceled spring season, the NCAA granted eligibility relief to spring student-athletes, and Major League Baseball shortened its 2020 draft. The result is a surplus of talent at the college level, paving the way for a 2021 college baseball season that could be one of the best in recent memory. UVa head coach Brian O\u2019Connor leads a team that returns star underclassmen like centerfielder Chris Newell. The Cavaliers also return left-handed reliever Andrew Abbott \u2014 who would likely be playing in the professional ranks if it wasn\u2019t for the shortened draft. Closer Stephen Schoch plans on using eligibility relief to return for a final spring. The loaded roster makes O\u2019Connor excited for this spring. He also knows his team will face a major challenge each weekend. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be awesome,\u201d O\u2019Connor said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be high-level baseball. There\u2019s not gonna be any weekends that you just feel like you\u2019re so much deeper and better than the opponent, and it\u2019s gonna be great. It\u2019s a lot of fun to prepare for.\u201d O\u2019Connor recently spoke with The Daily Progress to discuss fall preparations \u2014 the Wahoos are practicing together through the first week of November \u2014 and his expectations for a spring season that may still be impacted by COVID-19. Return to competition A chunk of college summer leagues were canceled, which left student-athletes with limited chances to hone their skills in competitive environments. While some players \u2014 like freshman Kyle Teel and veteran pitcher Paul Kosanovich \u2014 competed in different summer leagues, not everyone had that opportunity. Thanks to a lack of competition last summer coupled with a canceled spring season, O\u2019Connor wanted his players competing in practices this fall. That\u2019s led to some heated scrimmages. \u201cThe intrasquad scrimmages have been as competitive as we\u2019ve ever had here,\u201d O\u2019Connor said. \u201cI like where our talent is at.\u201d The Cavaliers played three times over the weekend, breaking into separate squads. The pitching matchups were impressive. Star underclassmen Nate Savino faced Abbott on Friday in a battle of left-handed pitchers, and last year\u2019s ace Griff McGarry went up against MLB prospect Mike Vasil on Saturday. All four pitchers finished last season with an ERA of 3.50 or lower and are considered MLB prospects. Building depth UVa\u2019s team features more than a handful of qualified pitchers with experience. From Abbott to Schoch in the bullpen to McGarry to Savino to Vasil as starters, O\u2019Connor likes his pitching staff. He also likes second-year pitching coach Drew Dickinson. The coach didn\u2019t finish his first full season last spring, but he\u2019s developing a strong relationship with the pitchers, and they\u2019re buying into his style of coaching. \u201cThere are a lot of options, and I love all the options that we have,\u201d O\u2019Connor said. \u201cI think the depth of the staff is very, very good. I feel like Drew Dickinson, our pitching coach, is just really connecting with our guys, really doing a fabulous job in the development part of it and getting our guys to compete.\u201d O\u2019Connor pointed to his team\u2019s depth on numerous occasions. He believes depth might be the most important factor in finding success in the spring. He\u2019s seen college football teams play games this fall with players unavailable for competition due to COVID-19. Even MLB and NFL teams adjusted to positive COVID-19 tests within their squads. While there\u2019s hope of a vaccine becoming available soon and treatments continuing to improve, the virus may still be a major factor when it comes to spring competition. \u201cI think depth is gonna be very, very important in the spring,\u201d O\u2019Connor said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be important because of COVID. All of a sudden, if you have a handful of players out for two or three weeks, that depth is hopefully what\u2019s going to keep you in the mix. If you don\u2019t have that depth and all of a sudden you lose two or three players for contact tracing or whatever it is, you could be in trouble.\u201d Fortunately for the Wahoos, they hold plenty of depth at numerous positions. At the plate, the Cavaliers return players like Max Cotier, Zack Gelof, Nick Kent and Newell, among others. There\u2019s tremendous talent and depth at just about every position. A bright spot this fall has been Alex Tappen. He started 54 games in 2018 before playing in 46 games in 2019. He struggled with injuries last spring, only starting five games. He could be in for an increased role from last spring in 2021. \u201cI feel like he\u2019s really having a nice fall,\u201d O\u2019Connor said. \u201cHe\u2019s been very, very consistent. Would be a nice little punch for our lineup and he\u2019s got some versatility, can play right field, play first base.\u201d Add Tappen to the list of players who add depth to UVa\u2019s arsenal. Spring schedule Virginia went 14-4 a season ago, only playing in 18 games. Whatever happens in the spring, O\u2019Connor wants to see close to a full 56-game schedule. \u201cI think it\u2019s important that we keep our number of games as high as we possibly can because these guys only got a chance to play a third of their season at best last year,\u201d O\u2019Connor said. Other sports, including many in the fall, went to conference-only schedules due to COVID-19 testing protocols. It\u2019s unclear what the spring sports will do, but O\u2019Connor hopes his team plays a full schedule if possible. O\u2019Connor also wants to see protocols implemented to help determine the point of when a cancellation or postponement needs to occur. For example, Power 5 football leagues crafted player minimums, meaning if a team is without a certain number of offensive linemen or quarterbacks, the game isn\u2019t held. \u201cYou have to have a certain amount of catchers, a certain amount of pitchers, certain amount of infielders to be able to play the series,\u201d O\u2019Connor said. \u201cI think that\u2019s going to be important for us to adopt something like that because if you happen to have three of your catchers down, you don\u2019t want your second baseman catching that\u2019s never caught before. It makes a mockery of the game.\u201d Enjoying the fall A productive fall practice period is coming to a close in early November for the Cavaliers, but they\u2019re making the most of the time together. Whether it\u2019s the intrasquad scrimmages or individual practice drills, O\u2019Connor loves being back on the field working toward a season. Health protocols remain in place, but the Cavaliers still play the game they love. \u201cIt\u2019s been a fall unlike we\u2019ve ever had before,\u201d O\u2019Connor said. \u201cThat said, it\u2019s still baseball. COVID hasn\u2019t affected the game. When the ball\u2019s hit and we collect an out do we throw the ball out? Yeah, we do, but when the ball\u2019s put in play and we say, \u2018Hey, play ball,\u2019 it\u2019s the same game.\u201d","591":"Scott Stadium has played a major factor in the growth of the Virginia football program. In UVa\u2019s nine-win 2019 season, the Cavaliers went a perfect 7-0 in Scott Stadium. Virginia took down Florida State and Virginia Tech in the friendly confines of its home venue, performing well in front of thousands of die-hard fans. This season, the electric atmosphere that helped propel Virginia to victories isn\u2019t nearly the same. The Cavaliers allow a maximum of 1,000 fans per home game due to restrictions caused by COVID-19. Energy was lacking in UVa\u2019s 38-21 defeat against N.C. State, arguably the Cavaliers\u2019 worst performance this fall. \u201cWe hadn\u2019t lost at home for so long,\u201d UVa head coach Bronco Mendenhall said Monday. \u201cOur game against N.C. State, I think that\u2019s another reason it caught me off guard. We\u2019re just kinda used to going in there and we just win. And there\u2019s this energy and there\u2019s this chemistry that almost overtakes you. I\u2019m not saying that had a negative effect, but when we walked in, when I walked in, it was like whoa. Wow, this doesn\u2019t feel like, I can\u2019t say doesn\u2019t feel like home, but it doesn\u2019t feel like Scott Stadium normally does.\u201d Through four games, UVa is 1-1 at home and 0-3 in road contests. Quality of opponents deserves mentioning when looking at the home and road splits. UVa\u2019s lone win came against a Duke team that\u2019s currently 1-5. The three road losses came to Clemson, Miami and Wake Forest. Those programs are a combined 14-3 this fall. Two of the defeats came when Miami and Wake Forest lost to Clemson. UVa\u2019s road losses came to good teams. The home loss came to a 4-2 N.C. State squad. In addition to being quality football programs, Clemson and Miami allowed more than 10,000 fans into their home games against UVa. Those fans were noticeable, even if it\u2019s not quite the same as a typical season. \u201cThe presence of fans seems more normal, and it seems more home field-ish, but I can\u2019t say that\u2019s changing the outcome,\u201d Mendenhall said. While limiting attendance seems like it would lead to less of a home-field advantage due to diminished crowd noise, home teams are winning at high rates this fall. Richmond Times-Dispatch columnist David Teel tweeted earlier this week that ACC teams won nearly 54% of their home conference games from 2015-19. This season, home ACC teams are 27-11 in conference action, winning at a clip just over 70%. Duke, Georgia Tech and Syracuse are the only ACC teams with overall losing records at home this fall. Eleven of the 15 ACC squads have winning records, and UVa sits at .500. Whether it\u2019s lack of travel during a pandemic or simply good fortune, home-field advantage seems to be relevant, even with limited attendance across the conference. That\u2019s good news for the Wahoos, who play their next three games at Scott Stadium. Even without many fans, the Cavaliers appreciate competing in Charlottesville. \u201cScott Stadium is just home for us,\u201d sophomore linebacker Nick Jackson said. \u201cWe\u2019re always treating Scott like it\u2019s a special place because it is a special place for us, and we bring the fourth side wherever we go. It\u2019s always nice to be at home.\u201d Several players say the fourth side, which consists of the players and coaches on the bench, gives them energy needed to play well. Those players not in the game remain engaged, watching the action and cheering from the sideline. The bench helps add the energy missing with thousands of fans at home instead of inside the venue. \u201cI think I\u2019ve always preached football is football at the end of the day,\u201d junior running back Wayne Taulapapa said. \u201cWhat excites me more is my brothers on the sideline, that fourth side that is really important to us every time we play, every time we get on the field.\u201d Mendenhall echoes the statements of Taulapapa. Scott Stadium developed into a place where UVa expected to win while feeding off a rowdy crowd. That\u2019s not the same this year and some responsibility falls on the fourth side to help make up for that. The Cavaliers hope an energetic fourth side can lead to improved play. UVa enters Saturday\u2019s night game against North Carolina on a four-game losing streak. Taking care of business at home is critical for the Cavaliers to salvage any chance at finishing the fall with a winning record. \u201cWe still value being at home,\u201d Mendenhall said. \u201cWe love being at home. We love being in our own stadium. But to say it\u2019s the same, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s fair because it\u2019s really not. We miss the support, right, and so we\u2019re really focusing on the fourth side which is our own players, because we know there\u2019s another fourth side supporting from afar, but we\u2019re really trying to help that become our advantage as well.\u201d","592":"After three events this fall, including three team victories for the men\u2019s squad, the Virginia cross country program heads to North Carolina on Friday for the ACC Championships. Due to COVID-19, no spectators will be allowed at the conference championship meet, but that hasn\u2019t diminished the excitement for UVa\u2019s programs. With three wins this fall, the men\u2019s program figures to be in the mix for the ACC championship. Star senior Rohann Asfaw, who has won each 8K event he\u2019s competed in this fall, doesn\u2019t want to put too much pressure on his group, though. \u201cI want us to do well,\u201d Asfaw said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to say anything super-specific. I want us to have a really good day and perform to the best of our abilities. That\u2019s what I want.\u201d Even with three individual and team victories this fall, Asfaw tries to remain loose before each race. He tries to avoid the burden of expectations, instead taking every race as it comes and enjoying the process. \u201cI really do just go in and whatever my best is on that day, that\u2019s what I\u2019m gonna give,\u201d Asfaw said. If Asfaw\u2019s best Friday resembles anything close to his other performances this fall season, he\u2019ll find himself toward the front of the ACC pack. Vin Lananna, UVa\u2019s director of track and field and cross country, echoed Asfaw\u2019s thoughts about expectations. He\u2019s looking for good performances from his team, but doesn\u2019t want to go in expecting a team title. \u201cI think on the men\u2019s side, it\u2019s probably six-deep,\u201d Lananna said of the ACC field. \u201cWe\u2019ll certainly be aiming to contend, but we\u2019ll see how it goes once we get to it.\u201d Lananna stressed the youth on his men\u2019s roster. He\u2019s pleased with their current results, especially with many of last year\u2019s key contributors graduated. Wes Porter has been particularly impressive. The freshman has been the second UVa runner to finish the 8K in each of the team\u2019s three races this fall. On the women\u2019s side, Lananna loves the growth of the program since he arrived last fall. \u201cThe most improved product from a track and field and a cross country perspective is our women\u2019s program,\u201d Lananna said. \u201cI mean, I\u2019m watching things that they\u2019re doing, which are really incredible, and the progress that they\u2019ve made.\u201d At the same time, he\u2019s realistic about their ACC title chances Friday. \u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019re in a position to contend for the ACC title,\u201d Lananna said. \u201cThe ACC may be the deepest conference in the country on the women\u2019s side.\u201d Even though the Cavaliers enter Friday\u2019s meet on the outside looking in, Lananna loves the development of the women\u2019s program. Senior Hannah Moran posted a career-best 5K time in the team\u2019s most recent meeting, taking 17 minutes and seven seconds to complete the race. Fellow seniors Gabriella Karas and Kiera Bothwell also posted the best 5K runs of their Virginia careers. \u201cI think we have a very hard-working, very determined group of women who have decided they want to be really good, and they put in the work over the summer,\u201d Lananna said. \u201cWe give them a structure and guideline, but it\u2019s up to them. We don\u2019t check and see if they\u2019re doing whatever they\u2019re doing. They came back fit, prepared, healthy.\u201d The offseason preparation made Lananna happy, and while the group likely won\u2019t compete for a title, Lananna thinks they\u2019re due for a better ACC showing than last year\u2019s 11th place finish. \u201cI have liked the way they\u2019ve trained, the way they\u2019ve performed, the way they\u2019ve raced,\u201d Lananna said. \u201cI think the women are poised to really improve dramatically over last year.\u201d","593":"A former Virginia standout turned NBA lottery pick pulls up from 3-point range. He receives the pass from a former UVa walk-on. A former Virginia manager tracks down the rebounds. The Virginia basketball program says it\u2019s a family. Those words rang true Thursday afternoon, when former UVa stars Devon Hall, De\u2019Andre Hunter and Ty Jerome worked out at Charlottesville High School with Damin Altizer, a player development coach and the head coach of the St. Anne\u2019s-Belfield varsity boys basketball team. Altizer walked on for the UVa men\u2019s basketball team more than a decade ago. Former Virginia men\u2019s basketball manager and Albemarle High School standout Grant Kersey stops by to help run the NBA players through drills. \u201cBecause they could be anywhere with anyone, the fact that they come back here is humbling,\u201d Altizer said. In addition to Hall, Hunter and Jerome, Justin Anderson, Anthony Gill and London Perrantes also spent time this offseason working with Altizer in Charlottesville. The coach feels fortunate that the same players who worked with him in college decided to keep using his services after they joined the professional ranks. \u201cIt\u2019s awesome,\u201d Altizer, who founded the player development organization DR1VEN Training, said. \u201cIt\u2019s weird because it gets to the point where it\u2019s like lottery pick, first-rounder, this, that, but for me it\u2019s \u2018Dre and Ty. It\u2019s the same kids who came in as awkward 18-year-olds.\u201d Hall spent the first two years of his professional career in Australia and bouncing between the NBA and G League, while Hunter and Jerome both received significant NBA minutes as rookies. Hunter, drafted No. 4 overall in the 2019 NBA Draft, developed into a key piece of the Atlanta Hawks\u2019 rotation this season. For the players returning to Charlottesville, they like turning to a coach they\u2019ve seen improve their games over the years. \u201cHe changed my game,\u201d Hall said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be here right now; I wouldn\u2019t have gone to where I was if it wasn\u2019t for him. He\u2019s next level.\u201d Hall, who made his NBA debut and scored his first NBA points this season, currently competes as a member of the Oklahoma City Thunder organization. Jerome, a member of the Phoenix Suns, credits Altizer for some of his collegiate growth, having worked with him while at UVa. He stressed the importance of Altizer understanding his game and knowing the type of training that will lead to results for the point guard. \u201cDamin had a big part of my growth throughout my years here at college at UVa, so I know for a fact that it works,\u201d Jerome said. \u201cHe sees the game in a great way. I trust his opinion, and he can really dictate workouts to what I need.\u201d Hunter enjoys practicing with fellow NBA-level talents while also returning to a town he embraced for multiple seasons as a Wahoo. \u201cUVa will always be a home for me,\u201d Hunter said. \u201cCharlottesville will always be a home for me.\u201d The loyalty of the various former UVa stars hits home for Altizer. It\u2019s not lost on him how exciting it is to work almost daily \u2014 Jerome and Hall have trained with Altizer six days a week for the past two months \u2014 with NBA athletes. They\u2019re among the first NBA players to turn to him regularly as their player development coach. \u201cI think it speaks to the type of kids that coach [Tony] Bennett has,\u201d Altizer said. \u201cEverything everybody knows about TB\u2019s kids, they\u2019re humble, they\u2019re hard-working, they\u2019re servants, they\u2019re never bigger than the program \u2026 they are everything they say they are and more.\u201d The guys weren\u2019t sure they\u2019d be able to make it to Charlottesville to train with Altizer when the pandemic first hit. Schools and gyms closed swiftly due to rapidly changing health conditions brought on by COVID-19. Jerome\u2019s agent reached to out to Charlottesville High School athletic director Rodney Redd in hopes of finding a spot to train. Redd, after discussing plans with school officials, determined the players could use the space to train with Altizer as long as they followed health protocols. Players wear masks prior to arriving in the gym. Altizer also provides hand sanitizer and ensures balls are cleaned when being used. The players keep their distance from each other and others when possible. Interactions within six feet are mostly limited to just players, many of which have rented a home in the area and have stayed there when training. Jerome and Hall have both been in town for the past two months or so. \u201cWithout Rodney Redd, these guys aren\u2019t here,\u201d Altizer said. \u201cHe\u2019s been a blessing. In March, I didn\u2019t even know him, and since then it\u2019s been like, \u2018Man, I\u2019m so, so fortunate to have met you.\u2019\u201d Redd\u2019s blessing helped bring the former UVa stars back to Charlottesville. With restrictions somewhat loosened in recent months, the professional stars have practiced on the same court as local middle and high school kids also using Altizer\u2019s services. The NBA athletes stay on one half of the court, while the local athletes remain on the other side. Other times, the NBA players wait for the local kids to wrap up their work before heading onto the court themselves. Hunter added that interactions are limited due to COVID-19, but if younger players come up to talk, the professionals gladly share a few words from a distance. The exchanges and appearance of the NBA players means a lot to Redd and Charlottesville High School. \u201cUVa as a whole and their athletes have done so much for the Charlottesville community,\u201d Redd said. \u201cEven though they do not mix with our kids or our athletes for COVID-19 reasons, just to know that our facilities are good enough for them and that\u2019s the type of athletes that train here \u2026 it just kind of bridges that gap between what could be and what some of their dreams are to know that those same guys are willing to come back here and train in some of the same spaces that they\u2019re in.\u201d The facility isn\u2019t anything flashy, but it\u2019s a gym with multiple hoops. That\u2019s more than enough for Hall, Hunter and Jerome. The man leading the workouts is respected by everyone in the building, from the former national champions to the teenagers learning how to properly handle the basketball. \u201cFrom lottery picks to middle school kids just trying to make the team, you don\u2019t really get that a lot of places,\u201d Altizer said. \u201cIt\u2019s fun that it\u2019s happening in Charlottesville.\u201d It\u2019s not lost on Altizer that the budding stars could train elsewhere. Instead, they choose to come to their college home to train with a guy who worked with them before they were stars. \u201cSo many guys are spending their offseason in L.A. or Miami or wherever,\u201d Altizer laughed. \u201cThey\u2019re back here in Charlottesville eating Sedona and Now & Zen.\u201d For the players, a chance to compete against fellow NBA athletes while returning to a town they love is an easy decision. \u201cIt\u2019s been awesome to just be back here together,\u201d Jerome said. \u201cThat\u2019s what you miss most about college, just being with your closest friends, closest teammates. The fact that we can all rent a house together and stay here, work out together, it\u2019s perfect.\u201d","594":"Tony Bennett and the Virginia men\u2019s basketball team will host Tom Izzo and the Michigan State Spartans in this year\u2019s ACC\/Big Ten Challenge, the ACC and UVa announced Friday. The game will be held on Dec. 9 at John Paul Jones Arena. The matchup pits two of the top programs in college basketball against each other, and it won\u2019t be the first meeting between the successful programs. Michigan State took down Virginia in the NCAA Tournament in both 2014 and 2015, despite UVa being the higher seed in each matchup. While the rosters looked different, revenge will be on the mind of some Cavaliers fans. Interestingly, the matchup also features a family rivalry. UVa\u2019s Sam Hauser will square off against Joey Hauser, his younger brother who plays at Michigan State. Both players originally started their college careers at Marquette and played a season together before opting to transfer. Sam played three seasons at Marquette, while Joey played one. The two standout performers sat out the 2019-20 season due to NCAA transfer rules. They spent their seasons as practice squad players, simulating opposing players. UVa-Michigan State sets up to be one of the marquee matchups of the entire ACC-Big Ten Challenge event. Other contests \u2014 such as Illinois at Duke \u2014 are expected to draw significant national interest as well. While UVa\u2019s full nonconference schedule for the 2020-21 season has yet to be revealed, the Cavaliers currently have three major nonconference games on their plate. The Wahoos play Florida at a neutral site on Nov. 27. They\u2019re now slated to host Michigan State on Dec. 9, and they have a game scheduled against Villanova for Dec. 19 at Madison Square Garden. COVID-19 makes all scheduled games less certain than previous seasons, but the nonconference slate appears to be one of UVa\u2019s toughest in recent memory if the Cavaliers can complete it safely. Fortunately for Bennett, his team features plenty of talent to stand up to tough foes. Kihei Clark returns as a veteran point guard for the group. Jay Huff gives the team a versatile scoring and defensive performer at center, and Hauser should slide into a small forward or power forward role. Additional depth at guard and forward makes the Cavaliers a potential top-10 team entering this season.","595":"Virginia needed an offensive explosion Saturday to keep up with Sam Howell and North Carolina\u2019s high-powered attack. A depleted secondary left UVa in a tough position, but the Cavaliers won a shootout against Howell and the Tar Heels. Bronco Mendenhall\u2019s group fought extremely hard, gutting out a 44-41 victory to vanquish its four-game losing streak. It was a gritty performance from a team desperate for a victory. \u201cIt\u2019s just more fun,\u201d Mendenhall said of winning. \u201cLet\u2019s just face it, it\u2019s just more fun. I like to see our players when they work so hard have fun, and I love to see them smile, and I love to see them carry themselves in a way that they\u2019re proud of the outcome. There have been so many really cool plays that I can celebrate with them in team meetings, but it\u2019s not the same when the world doesn\u2019t see them.\u201d Transfers made plays all over the field for Virginia in its upset over the Tar Heels. Offensively, Keytaon Thompson carried the ball 10 times for 43 yards and a touchdown. He also converted the critical fourth-and-short on a fake punt late in the contest to clinch UVa\u2019s win. \u201cHe\u2019s becoming one of the cultural examples that we can present when a player comes into our program,\u201d Mendenhall said. Thompson did a little bit of everything Saturday. He lined up at wide receiver, running back and quarterback and even on special teams. He motioned under center at times, creating a surprise quarterback sneak setup. UVa used him creatively, and Thompson is clearly embracing the role. \u201cWhen you list the position, it\u2019d be smart just to put football underneath,\u201d Mendenhall said. \u201cHe might be setting a record for the most different positions played in a game each and every week. We\u2019re so thankful he\u2019s here because we need him.\u201d Shane Simpson, a Towson transfer, finished the game as UVa\u2019s leading rusher and receiver. He tallied 71 yards receiving on one touchdown reception, and he added eight carries for 70 yards on the ground. Despite only receiving nine touches, Simpson made his chances count. \u201cI actually have a tattoo on my hand, that says \u2018patience,\u2019\u201d Simpson said. \u201cJust waiting for my moment, and I have the guys around me to help me do it.\u201d He took advantage when his number was called. Transfer tight end Tony Poljan also found the end zone on a reception, and Ra\u2019Shaun Henry snagged one pass for an 18-yard touchdown to give him touchdowns in consecutive weeks. Both of Henry\u2019s receptions this fall went for touchdowns. Defensively, James Madison transfers D\u2019Angelo Amos and Adeeb Atariwa combined for 11 tackles. Controlling the clock While UNC finished the contest with more total yards, Virginia won the time of possession battle by nearly 10 minutes. The Cavaliers held onto the ball for 34 minutes and 34 seconds, running 73 plays to UNC\u2019s 61. \u201cThe offense was the primary reason or the driver of our win tonight because of not only the points we scored, but the time of possession and the consistency through the whole game,\u201d Mendenhall said. \u201cWhile UNC was launching rockets over and over again and scoring so fast, we were fairly methodically but effectively moving the ball, moving the ball, moving the ball and then scoring.\u201d The strategy kept UNC\u2019s rushing attack at bay, limiting the Tar Heels to just 93 yards on the ground when including sacks. Without sacks, North Carolina still only recorded 126 rushing yards. Howell threw for 443 yards and four touchdowns, but it wasn\u2019t enough. UVa possessed the ball for 11 minutes and 58 seconds in the fourth quarter, ensuring Howell wouldn\u2019t touch the ball last. Player and coach availability After four consecutive games with at least one player unavailable for competition due to COVID-19, no UVa student-athletes missed Saturday\u2019s game because of the virus. One full-time coach did miss the game, however. The coach recently tested positive for COVID-19 and is in isolation. Outside of COVID-19, UVa played without a few athletes due to injury or undisclosed reasons. Quarterback Ira Armstead missed the contest, joining cornerback Darrius Bratton, safeties Joey Blount and Brenton Nelson as well as wide receiver Lavel Davis Jr. as UVa contributors unavailable Saturday night. Defensive end Richard Burney also missed the contest. Starting quarterback Brennan Armstrong left the game with an injury, but no update was given on his status after the game.","596":"The University of Virginia athletics department administered 1,038 COVID-19 tests from Oct. 26-Nov. 1. Of those tests, two came back positive. The test positivity rate from last week\u2019s results sits at 0.2%. Both positive tests were from staff members, meaning there were no new COVID-19 positive tests among student-athletes last week. The two staff members who tested positive for COVID-19 will self-isolate for a minimum of 10 days, based on local health guidelines. Any close contacts of those staff members are required to self-quarantine for two weeks. The Virginia football team played Saturday night against North Carolina with all student-athletes available. The team did, however, compete without one full-time coach. According to the school\u2019s release, the staff member tested positive for COVID-19 and was unavailable for the UNC game. The Cavaliers have been without at least one player or coach for five of their six games this season due to COVID-19 protocols. Saturday\u2019s contest did mark the first time since UVa\u2019s season opener against Duke that the Cavaliers had zero players unavailable due to COVID-19. The Virginia volleyball team finished its fall season over the weekend, navigating through competition during the pandemic. While the Cavaliers dealt with schedule changes due to COVID-19, they ultimately pushed through the fall season. The Cavaliers\u2019 cross country team also recently completed their fall season of competition. Since UVa athletics began testing for COVID-19 on July 5, the athletic department has administered 10,064 COVID-19 tests. There were 91 total positives as a result of those tests, which marks a 0.9% test positivity rate.","597":"As the calendar turns to November, Virginia\u2019s Olympic sport programs are wrapping up their fall seasons. Unlike football, there\u2019s no national championship this fall, meaning fall seasons end after regular seasons or ACC Tournaments. The UVa volleyball team\u2019s fall campaign ended this past weekend, while field hockey and women\u2019s soccer move one step closer to completing their fall slates. Elsewhere in the Virginia sports world, two of the most recognizable men\u2019s athletes at UVa earned honors for their respective performances. ACC honors for Snowden Charles Snowden put together one of the most dominant individual performances of any ACC player this weekend. The linebacker finished with 10 tackles, four sacks and a forced fumble in the UVa football team\u2019s 44-41 upset victory over North Carolina on Saturday. The stellar showing earned Snowden ACC Linebacker of the Week honors. \u201cI had gotten off to a slow start this year and now to finally be producing and making plays, it feels great,\u201d Snowden said after the game. \u201cSacks always are a great thing.\u201d On the season, Snowden\u2019s sack tally sits at five. All five of the sacks have come in the past two games. After recording 22 tackles and one tackle for loss in UVa\u2019s first four games this season, Snowden posted 18 tackles, 7.5 tackles for loss and five sacks in the team\u2019s previous two contests. He\u2019s stepped up, playing some of the best football of his career in the past two games. Clark on Cousy watch list UVa point guard Kihei Clark was named to the Bob Cousy Award watch list Monday. The award goes to the best point guard in college basketball. Clark was one of 20 players to land on the list. Entering his junior season, Clark\u2019s resume speaks for itself. He played on UVa\u2019s national championship winning squad in 2018-19 before taking on a bigger role in 2019-20. Clark started all 30 games for UVa last season, averaging 10.8 points, 5.9 assists and 4.2 rebounds per game. Clark made 37.5% of his 2-point shots, while also knocking down 87.6% of his free-throw attempts last season. Field hockey set for ACC Tournament The Virginia field hockey team\u2019s regular season ended over the weekend with the Cavaliers falling 2-0 to Duke on Saturday. The Wahoos played hard, but just came up short in the defeat. \u201cWe were playing some great hockey, but nothing on the board to show for it,\u201d head coach Michele Madison said after the game. \u201cAll we can do is just keep shooting and get that ball into the back of the net.\u201d Madison\u2019s team ends the regular season with a 3-6 overall record and a 2-3 mark in ACC action. The Cavaliers start their ACC Tournament journey Thursday against Wake Forest. UVa enters the tournament as the No. 4 seed. The game against Wake Forest \u2014 which will be played at UNC\u2019s campus \u2014 begins at 2 p.m. and airs on the ACC Network. Virginia went 1-1 against the Demon Deacons in games this fall. A win would send the Cavaliers to the ACC semifinals, creating a meeting with No. 1 seed Louisville on Friday afternoon. Women\u2019s soccer earns No. 3 seed After beating Syracuse 5-3 on Sunday with five different players scoring goals, the Virginia women\u2019s soccer team will receive plenty of time to rest. The Cavaliers start the ACC Tournament on Nov. 10 against Louisville. The Wahoos earned the No. 3 seed, and they\u2019ll face sixth-seeded Louisville in the quarterfinals. A victory would set up a matchup with No. 2 North Carolina or No. 7 Virginia Tech in the semifinals, which are set to be played on Nov. 13. Should UVa advance to the conference championship, the game would be held on Nov. 15. All games during the event will take place at WakeMed Soccer Park in Cary, North Carolina. Volleyball finishes season The UVa volleyball team\u2019s 2020 fall season came to a close over the weekend. The Cavaliers lost to North Carolina twice, finishing off a winless conference season. Virginia went 1-8 overall and 0-8 in ACC action, losing its final eight matches of the season. Injuries and COVID-19 absences adjusted the team\u2019s schedule and put the Cavaliers at a competitive disadvantage at times. \u201cIt\u2019s been a really interesting fall,\u201d head coach Aaron Smith said. \u201cWe\u2019ve dealt with a ton of adversity. Every school has, but I give our team a ton of credit for coming into every match and fighting tooth and nail. I felt like we got better.\u201d Come the spring, Smith expects a healthy roster. With his full arsenal of talent, he\u2019s hopeful the Cavaliers can find more success. \u201cI\u2019m eager to get a few people back that we haven\u2019t had these last few weeks,\u201d Smith said. \u201cWe anticipate having a more complete roster come spring.\u201d","598":"The Virginia football team took Tuesday off due to NCAA Election Day guidelines, but head coach Bronco Mendenhall still spoke to the media about this week\u2019s home game against Louisville. The Cavaliers (2-4, 2-4 ACC) enter Saturday\u2019s showdown fresh off a 44-41 upset victory over North Carolina. A win over the Cardinals would send UVa into its bye week on a two-game winning streak with an FCS matchup waiting for it the week after the bye. It\u2019s an important game for the Wahoos. Election Day Ahead of Saturday\u2019s important game against Louisville, UVa\u2019s practice schedule changed. With Tuesday off for Election Day, the Cavaliers opted for a Monday night practice. \u201cAs a result of [Election Day], we altered our schedule yesterday, which was Monday, and we practiced last night after a full day of preparation at approximately the same time the game would be, and so that\u2019s how we handled it,\u201d Mendenhall said. \u201cThat basically gave us the one practice that we would have had today.\u201d Mendenhall\u2019s coaching staff made the quick change to accommodate the day off. He also credited wide receivers coach Marques Hagans for work earlier this fall helping players register to vote. UVa\u2019s head coach feels like the student-athletes were given ample chances to register and make their voices heard. In addition to the chance to vote, the Wahoos get a well-deserved rest day during a hectic fall season. \u201cCoach Hagans did a really nice job of leading an initiative and having the voter registration organizations come to our football facility, and everyone that certainly wants to will have every opportunity to vote today, but also they\u2019re getting just a nice break in schedule,\u201d Mendenhall said. Injury updates Injury updates headlined Tuesday\u2019s press conference. Defensive end Richard Burney is out for the season, Mendenhall shared. Starting quarterback Brennan Armstrong left Saturday\u2019s game against North Carolina with an apparent leg injury, and Mendenhall says the quarterback is \u201creturning to health.\u201d In other quarterback news, freshman Iraken Armstead recently suffered an injury and missed the UNC game. Armstead\u2019s freshman campaign is over, Mendenhall announced Tuesday. \u201cIra will now be gone for the season as well,\u201d Mendenhall said. \u201cHe has an injury. He was not available for the last game, and so that\u2019s become clear.\u201d At defensive back, Mendenhall isn\u2019t sure when safeties Joey Blount and Brenton Nelson may return. He\u2019s optimistic they can come back soon, but he also shared that they may be out until after the bye week. On the positive side, Indiana transfer running back Ronnie Walker Jr. has recovered from his illness and may make his UVa debut against Louisville. \u201cRonnie was still not available last week,\u201d Mendenhall said. \u201cHe is available now. He was with us practicing yesterday.\u201d Scouting Louisville Stopping Louisville\u2019s high-octane offense \u2014 the Cardinals average just under 30 points per game and feature a handful of explosive playmakers \u2014 makes Saturday\u2019s matchup similar to last weekend\u2019s. Both Louisville and North Carolina can score touchdowns quickly thanks to dynamic players at running back and wide receiver. Stopping running back Javian Hawkins becomes priority No. 1 on Saturday night. \u201cHe\u2019s definitely a talented guy,\u201d defensive tackle Jowon Briggs said Monday. \u201cWe really just have to emphasize playing good run defense.\u201d Briggs says UVa aims to hold each of its opponents to 3.5 yards per carry or worse. On the flip side, Louisville believes it\u2019s better than its record indicates. Some media members believed the Cardinals were ready to contend for a spot in the ACC title game this fall. Instead, Louisville sits at 2-5 overall and 1-5 in the ACC this year. One-possession losses to Pittsburgh, Notre Dame and Virginia Tech illustrate that the Cardinals are close to being a winning team, but the results just haven\u2019t been there. \u201cWe\u2019ve been in the games, we just haven\u2019t closed them out,\u201d Louisville head coach Scott Satterfield said Monday. \u201cWhen you think about last year, we were able to beat Boston College on a field go there within a minute to go. We beat Wake Forest right there at the end. We were able to close out Virginia last year in the fourth quarter. I think being able to close out games is huge.\u201d Despite a combined record of 4-9, both UVa and Louisville possess the talent and coaching to beat just about anyone in the ACC outside of Clemson. Saturday\u2019s battle pits two quality, yet underachieving teams against each other. Virus protocols UVa reported no positive COVID-19 tests among student-athletes last week. Since missing seven players in the games against Clemson and N.C. State, the Cavaliers have done well to keep most of their players available. \u201cThe issue really wasn\u2019t the virus contraction, it was contact tracing,\u201d Mendenhall said. \u201cNow that we\u2019re becoming clear on what the contact tracers are asking, it\u2019s allowing us more clarity on at least we can address those things.\u201d The risk of the virus still exists \u2014 a ranked Wisconsin team recently canceled its Saturday game against Purdue due to COVID-19 issues \u2014 but the Cavaliers\u2019 numbers remain low, allowing them to take the field each Saturday. \u201cI think it\u2019s been effective, not perfect,\u201d Mendenhall said, \u201cand it doesn\u2019t mean we still couldn\u2019t test positive or I couldn\u2019t or someone else, but within the scope of what we know, I think we\u2019re doing well.\u201d","599":"Virginia is set to play its seventh football game of the season next Saturday, at home against Louisville. Each one landed on the ACC Network. Pittsburgh\u2019s road test at Florida State this week marks the Panthers\u2019 seventh ACC Network appearance in eight games this year. Virginia Tech\u2019s home date with Liberty on Saturday is the Hokies\u2019 fifth ACC Network game in seven outings. Through games of Nov. 7, no other conference program has been ticketed for the ACC Network more than four times. Sheer coincidence? Or, a none-too-subtle jab at a cable television powerhouse? You be the judge. With more than 20 million subscribers, Xfinity Comcast is among the nation\u2019s largest pay TV providers. To date, it is also the 15-month-old ACC Network\u2019s white whale, the marquee void in the network\u2019s national availability. Large swaths of Virginia are Xfinity Comcast strongholds. As is Pittsburgh. So are the ACC\u2019s television partners at ESPN, and their parent company, Disney, attempting to leverage Xfinity Comcast? Do they believe Xfinity Comcast customers who crave ACC sports, particularly those in Virginia and western Pennsylvania, will raise Cain with Xfinity Comcast and\/or switch providers? ESPN would not answer questions but provided a statement from Kurt Dargis, director for programming and acquisitions. \u201cMany factors go into the game selection process across all networks and platforms,\u201d Dargis said. \u201cIn consultation with all of our conference partners, we work collaboratively in an attempt to select the best games for the best windows to serve fans and our businesses.\u201d That\u2019s not going to appease aggravated fans and customers. Nor should it. So at the risk of venturing deep into the weeds, let\u2019s try to unravel this standoff. First, I understand folks\u2019 irritation, made worse because many of you are long-time season-ticket holders who can\u2019t attend games this season because of pandemic restrictions. Sure, you can listen to the games on radio \u2014 legions have for years while in the stands or watching from home \u2014 but unless you\u2019re driving, radio-only is most likely not the preference. You also could change cable providers, or cut the cord and subscribe to a streaming service, many of which offer the ACC Network. But that can be a hassle, complete with contracts and connection fees. In charting the network\u2019s August 2019 launch, ACC officials understood Xfinity Comcast was going to be a problem. The cable firm\u2019s current carriage deal with ESPN\/Disney does not expire until September 2021, and it has long resisted renegotiating contracts midstream. Launched in 2007, the Big Ten Network, a partnership between the conference and Fox, did not reach a carriage arrangement with Comcast until 2008. A decade later, Comcast briefly dropped the network in non-Big Ten markets, prompting then-network president Mark Silverman to call out the cable provider at the conference\u2019s preseason football gathering. Even without Comcast, the ACC Network was available in more homes at launch than was the BTN. Moreover, without revealing details, ACC commissioner John Swofford and league athletic directors such as Virginia Tech\u2019s Whit Babcock have said the ACC Network exceeded financial projections in fiscal 2019-20. The network is contracted to televise 40 football games per season, and last year\u2019s fare included 15 non-conference contests and 25 league matchups. Each ACC program appeared on the network at least three times, with Virginia Tech at four and UVa at six, the latter trailing only Boston College\u2019s seven. Boston, by the way, is another strong Xfinity Comcast market. Due to the pandemic, this season\u2019s schedule changed drastically. Teams are playing 10 league games instead of eight, one non-conference date instead of four. That translates to fewer overall contests and a greater likelihood of landing on the ACC Network as it pushes toward the 40-game quota. Also, ESPN is airing less ACC football on ESPN2 and ESPNU, platforms that aired a combined seven ACC games in 2019 \u2014 Saturday\u2019s Duke-North Carolina clash is the first ACC game on either network this season. Finally, it\u2019s incumbent to note that the UVa-Virginia Tech matchup Sept. 19 was slotted for ABC. However, a COVID-19 outbreak in the Hokies\u2019 program forced postponement until Dec. 12, with that TV assignment yet to be determined. Babcock, who dropped Xfinity Comcast as his TV provider, tweeted last month about how Comcast customers in Virginia can watch the SEC and Big Ten channels, but not the ACC Network. In so doing, he also touted fuboTV\u2019s streaming service. Virginia AD Carla Williams declined to comment on the subject, but Cavaliers football coach Bronco Mendenhall certainly has noticed the ACC Network\u2019s affinity for airing his team\u2019s games in prime time. \u201cIt\u2019s completely altered my bedtime,\u201d Mendenhall said Tuesday. \u201cI\u2019m an early go-to-bed-er. Seems like we\u2019re not only on, but in the 8 o\u2019clock window, which, that\u2019s like a red-eye flight for me. It takes like a three-day recovery to get that thing going again. \u201cAnd I hadn\u2019t really even thought about ACC Network, other than I was at home [one Saturday afternoon] because it was an 8 o\u2019clock game, and I was trying to find games in our league, and I couldn\u2019t find it on my own TV. I had to ask [wife] Holly, what channel is this on? Even though we have it, it was not an easy find.\u201d By next season, hopefully more UVa and Virginia Tech fans will have the ACC Network, too.","600":"It\u2019s an exciting week for Virginia sports fans. The football team enters Saturday\u2019s matchup against Louisville off an upset win over North Carolina. The men\u2019s basketball team shared news that a few star players have landed on preseason award watch lists. On the field, the UVa field hockey team begins postseason play Thursday, hoping to pick up three wins this weekend to win a conference title during an unusual season. Michele Madison\u2019s team ended the regular season on a five-game losing streak to finish 3-6 overall and 2-3 in ACC play, but much of that was due to challenging matchups. The ACC features arguably the deepest collection of talented teams of any league in the nation, and it\u2019s hard to win consistently. The Cavaliers played well for most of this season despite a string of losses. They hope they can turn quality play into consistent wins this week. Virginia opens the ACC Tournament on Thursday against Wake Forest in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. The game starts at 2 p.m. and will air on the ACC Network. The Cavaliers went 1-1 against Wake Forest this fall, with both games decided by a goal. Madison expects to see a good Demon Deacons team that stresses defenses with rapid passes. \u201cI imagine they look a little faster in execution than when we played them,\u201d Madison said. \u201cEveryone\u2019s better after you beat each other up in the ACC.\u201d This time around, at least, the Cavaliers enter the game healthy. \u201cWith COVID and players in and out of the team, we\u2019re happy to have everybody \u2014 knock on wood \u2014 for tomorrow,\u201d Madison said Wednesday. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have four core players last time we played them.\u201d Should the Wahoos win, they\u2019ll face No. 1 seed Louisville in the semifinals Friday. The Cavaliers went 0-2 against the Cardinals this fall, but competed well in each loss. An upset wouldn\u2019t be completely out of the question. Should UVa qualify, the championship match will take place Sunday at noon. Regardless of the results, Madison is pleased her team received a chance to play and compete this fall during a pandemic. \u201cI\u2019m really proud of the team and the coaching staff, everyone, for just staying focused in a very uncertain world,\u201d Madison said. Hauser on watch list Virginia men\u2019s basketball player Sam Hauser landed on the 2021 Julius Erving Small Forward of the Year Award watch list Wednesday. The award goes to the top small forward in men\u2019s colllege basketball. Hauser is one of 20 players on the watch list. Hauser, a Marquette transfer, sat out last season due to NCAA transfer rules. He\u2019s expected to become a key piece of UVa\u2019s rotation this season. In his last season at Marquette, Hauser averaged an impressive 14.9 points and 7.2 rebounds per contest. He shot over 40% from beyond the 3-point arc. Smyth wins tournament UVa women\u2019s golfer Riley Smyth isn\u2019t competing in team events this fall due to COVID-19, but she\u2019s allowed to compete individually in tournaments. Smyth played in the Golfweek Carolina CC Amateur from Nov. 1-3, and won the event. A strong start \u2014 she opened with a 3-under par 69 \u2014 helped her jump out to a lead. She added a 72 in her second round to take a commanding five-stroke lead into the final round. Despite shooting a 78 in a challenging final round, Smyth held on for a one-stroke victory over Madison Moosa. The win continued an impressive stretch of golf for Smyth, who also made the quarterfinals of the U.S. Women\u2019s Amateur over the summer.","601":"That time ended last month, when the Charlottesville native retired from his post as the special assistant to Washington Nationals general manager and president of baseball operations Mike Rizzo after his contract expired on Oct. 31. \u201cIt\u2019s something I\u2019ve been thinking about for a couple of years, so it wasn\u2019t a spur of the moment thing,\u201d Cubbage said. \u201cI\u2019m at a peace with it. I thought it was just time to turn away from the game.\u201d The national pastime wasn\u2019t just a sport for Cubbage, but a rite of passage. He grew up in a baseball family. His mother, Marge, was part of the well-known Haney family in Barboursville. Larry Haney, Cubbage\u2019s cousin, played 10 seasons at catcher in the big leagues. Haney\u2019s son, Chris, followed in his footsteps and pitched 13 years in the majors. \u201cI started young,\u201d Cubbage said. \u201cMy mother\u2019s family was a baseball family. They had a glove on me at age 3 and she had me catching pop-ups. She bragged on me about how she taught me how to catch.\u201d Lindy, his father, served as his hitting coach growing up and helped develop him as a player. Cubbage\u2019s journey to pro ball started in 1955, when his father took him to Briggs Stadium to watch the Detroit Tigers play. \u201cThat is when the passion started and the dream began,\u201d Cubbage said. \u201cAl Kaline became my idol. I got to meet him and got to know him over the years and I was really crushed by his death this year.\u201d Cubbage was a three-sport standout at Lane High School in the early 1960s, excelling at football, basketball and baseball. He played quarterback for Tommy Theodose and was part of the Lane football team that won a record-setting 53 consecutive games. In basketball, he played with Virginia Sports Hall of Famer Frankie Allen and was a part of two teams that advanced to the state semifinals. \u201cI had a lot of opportunities,\u201d he said. \u201cI played all the time. I was a baseball rat during the season. I had batting cages, good coaching and lots of opportunities, I played five years of Little League baseball with the Kiwanis Club, American Legion baseball, Valley League Baseball and at UVa. I got plenty of at-bats and lots of games played under my belt.\u201d The 70-year-old, who will be inducted in to the Virginia Sports Hall of Fame next spring, said those experiences prepared him for life as a pro baseball player. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt my experiences at Lane High School, playing football with the state-record winning streak, playing big games in pressure-packed situations were crucial,\u201d he said. \u201cI learned a lot from those experiences. You can\u2019t get better unless you play against good competition.\u201d Cubbage was originally selected in the fifth round of the 1968 MLB Draft by the Washington Senators but did not sign and went to play football and baseball at University of Virginia on a baseball scholarship. Freshmen were not eligible to play, but the next year Cubbage won the starting quarterback job for Coach George Blackman midway through his sophomore season. His starting job lasted just one game. Cubbage dislocated his left elbow in the third quarter against North Carolina, all but ending his football career. \u201cWe weren\u2019t very good that year, but we were driving in the third quarter at around the 19-yard line,\u201d he recalled. \u201cIt was a shoestring tackle and I reached out with my left hand to brace myself and that\u2019s when the injury happened. That was it, I retired from football. I was willing to play, but I knew my future and dreams were in baseball.\u201d Two years later, pro baseball came calling again. Cubbage was selected in the second round in the secondary round of the 1971 free-agent draft by the Senators. He spent three years in the minor leagues before making his MLB debut April 7 against the Oakland Athletics. Cubbage\u2019s first major league hit was a grand slam off Bill Singer on June 20, 1975 after going hitless in three call-ups the year before. \u201cIt took a long time coming,\u201d he said. He finished his career with four grand slams, one in each of his first four seasons, and also hit for the cycle. In addition, he became one of only 53 players in major league history to homer in his final big league at-bat when he took Jeff Reardon deep Oct. 3, 1981, joining the likes of Ted Williams, Todd Zeile and Jim Edmonds. \u201cIt\u2019s probably the only category [Williams] and I would be in together,\u201d Cubbage said. He combined to play eight years in the big leagues with the Rangers, Twins and Mets. The left-handed hitter posted a career .258 average with 34 home runs and 251 RBI as a utility infielder before moving on to a career in coaching. \u201cI was just an average player,\u201d he said. \u201cI got eight years of playing in the major leagues. I had some physical limitations, but there were no limitations with regards to coaching. I thought I had a better coaching career. I enjoyed it.\u201d Cubbage managed seven seasons in the minor leagues, including winning a Triple-A championship with the Tidewater (Norfolk) Tides, as well as a stint with the Lynchburg Hillcats. He also served 14 seasons as a bench coach in the big leagues with the Mets, Astros and Red Sox, coaching the likes of Craig Biggio, Billy Wagner, Jeff Bagwell and Moises Alou, among others. He managed seven games for the Mets at the end of the 1991 season following the dismissal of Bud Harrelson and finished with a 3-4 record. Cubbage\u2019s final game in uniform came in the 2003 American League Championship Series as a bench coach for the Boston Red Sox. He watched in disbelief as Aaron Boone hit a walk-off home run to send the Yankees to the World Series. \u201cBooney is a great guy,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery time I see him, I tell him to take the knife out of my back. I worked a lot of different places, I spent a long time with the Mets, Houston and Boston. They were great experiences everywhere.\u201d From there, Cubbage went into pro scouting. He worked with the Tampa Bay Rays before spending the past six years with the Washington Nationals. He was a pro scout for the Rays in 2008 when Tampa Bay won the AL pennant. In 2014, after general manager Andrew Friedman left the organization for the Los Angeles Dodgers and manager Joe Maddon departed for a job with the Chicago Cubs, Cubbage started looking for a new opportunity. He reached out to Bill Singer, a former teammate, who put in a good word with Rizzo. \u201cI asked permission to shop around and I reached out to the Nationals and got hired in a few days,\u201d he said. \u201cI wanted to get back in the area and I also thought they were competitive and had a chance to win. Late in your career, you want to win and have a chance to compete and I thought Washington had a chance to do that.\u201d Indeed they did. The Nationals captured the 2019 World Series following a memorable postseason run. Cubbage said the World Series ring was a perfect ending to his baseball career. \u201cI think I got better with age,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was an older group of guys [in the front office] and I really liked the way they did things there. I worked with seven or eight organizations, only the superstars get to chose one team forever. I gave them a good day\u2019s pay and whatever they wanted. I like to compete and I like to play for championships and that we did. I didn\u2019t play for that many as a major league player. You\u2019re trying to get a ring on your finger and I ended up with three.\u201d Cubbage\u2019s final year in pro baseball was an interesting one because of COVID-19. Instead of attending games, he spent the summer in Charlottesville scouting games by television. Cubbage said the past six months helped fortify his decision to retire. \u201cI\u2019ve been doing a lot of work around the house and the yard,\u201d he said. \u201cI also live on a golf course and used to play a lot and had given it up. I plan to start playing again. I\u2019ve even been shopping around for a golf cart.\u201d Cubbage also plans to devote his free time to watching his grandchildren\u2019s games in Northern Virginia. He\u2019s also working with a writer in Gloucester on an upcoming book project about his life. He expects the book to be published in the next year or two. Baseball will remain a big part of his life in retirement. \u201cI\u2019ve got a gold lifetime pass, so that gets me into any ballpark in the country,\u201d Cubbage said. \u201cI already told the Nationals that they\u2019ll see more of me in the coming years than the last six years that I worked for them.\u201d","602":"Louisville\u2019s football program paused team activities as a result of the outbreak. Louisville was without several players in last weekend\u2019s game against Virginia Tech due to COVID-19 issues, and the Cardinals now can\u2019t play this weekend after additional positive tests received Wednesday evening. The game has been tentatively rescheduled for 3:30 p.m. on Nov. 14, which was previously a bye week for the Wahoos. That week was originally reserved for UVa\u2019s game against Duke, but the matchup with the Blue Devils was moved to Sept. 26 after the UVa-Virginia Tech game set for Sept. 19 was also moved due to positive tests within Virginia Tech\u2019s program. The Cavaliers will face the Hokies on Dec. 12. Instead of facing the Cardinals this Saturday, the Cavaliers hope to play Louisville a week from Saturday in Charlottesville. Louisville also had an off week scheduled for Nov. 14, making the postponement somewhat convenient for both sides. \u201cWe are taking a precautionary measure to pause due to the number of student-athletes and staff that have been impacted by the virus,\u201d Louisville director of athletics Vince Tyra said in a statement. \u201cWith Virginia and us both having a bye week on November 14, we are fortunate to reschedule the game for that date.\u201d According to Tyra, 10 student-athletes tested positive for COVID-19 and an additional five are quarantining due to close contact with those athletes. Five support staff members also tested positive and two additional support staff members are in quarantine. \u201cWe felt it was necessary due to the fact that the support staff that tested positive, they work closely with our players in the training room and in the equipment area,\u201d Tyra said in a Wednesday night press conference. Health guidelines mandate anyone who tests positive self-isolate for a minimum of 10 days. Close contacts who quarantine must do so for two weeks. Louisville officials spoke with UVa director of athletics Carla Williams during the process of potentially postponing the game, and Tyra added that both the ACC and UVa were respectful of the decision to pause activities. Tyra added that test results from Friday and Sunday will determine when the Cardinals can return to team activities, which are currently halted. Currently, players and staff aren\u2019t allowed to use the team facility due to the pause in activities. The rescheduled Virginia-Louisville matchup is set to air on the ACC Network on Nov. 14, but if the Cardinals can\u2019t return to activities early next week, the game could once again be rescheduled. With both teams well out of the conference title hunt, Tyra mentioned that the game could theoretically take place on Dec. 19 \u2013 the same day as the ACC Championship Game. After numerous schedule changes at the beginning of the season, UVa went through a solid stretch of games without major COVID-19 issues on either side. Despite no player positives ahead of last week\u2019s game for the Wahoos, they\u2019ll be on the sidelines Saturday due to the Louisville outbreak. COVID-19 remains a threat to completing the season, even if UVa\u2019s players and staff remain largely safe from the virus. Now, the Cavaliers will wait, hoping to compete again on Nov. 14. \u201cMy hope is that we get this game in next week,\u201d Tyra said.","603":"The 6-foot-7, 315-pound football player strapped into catcher\u2019s gear came away with fewer bruises than the 6-4, 235-pound baseball pitcher working out as a pass rusher. When the spread of COVID forced the cancellation of Virginia Tech spring football practice and Major League Baseball spring training, Luke and Matt Tenuta found themselves at home with their family in Cincinnati. Luke, a former Western Albemarle High School standout and a redshirt sophomore offensive lineman for the Hokies, had a list of pass-blocking skills to work on. Matt, a minor league pitcher most recently in the Chicago Cubs system, needed to long toss and throw his bullpen sessions. \u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019ve seen too many guys his size back there catching,\u201d said Matt this week. \u201cI was ripping all my pitches, throwing sliders. There were a few he didn\u2019t get the glove on and hit them. But by the end of it, he was doing a pretty darn good job.\u201d When the baseball work \u2014 which usually included the men\u2019s father, former Virginia football player and assistant coach Jon Tenuta, serving as the cutoff man to get the ball back from Luke to Matt during long toss on a nearby high school football field \u2014 the focus turned to pass rush drills. \u201cLuckily there weren\u2019t too many people around to watch me get thrown on my back almost every play,\u201d Matt said. \u201cOr if I cut inside, he\u2019d throw me on my front. There was multiple days I\u2019d come home and take my shirt off and have to show my mom the bruises from Luke.\u201d Bruises aside, the Tenutas enjoyed their time together in the spring and summer. Jon has a weight room in his garage both men used to stay in shape. Luke is the Hokies\u2019 starting right tackle going into Saturday\u2019s game against No. 25 Liberty at Lane Stadium, a game Matt will attend before leaving next week to play professional baseball in Australia. Jon is on the staff at Cincinnati, where the Bearcats have opened the season 5-0 and are ranked No. 6 in the nation. Jon\u2019s schedule \u2014 as it always has \u2014 keeps him from attending most of Luke\u2019s games. Jon has coached at 14 different Division I programs, including serving as UVa\u2019s defensive coordinator from 2013-15. All three of his sons graduated from different high schools in different states, and Jon credits his wife, Dori, a former Virginia basketball player who he says is the \u201cbest athlete in the family,\u201d with raising the boys while his work schedule kept him away. Still, Jon always finds time to watch video of Luke\u2019s games at Tech, offering advice and coaching whenever he\u2019s asked. \u201cI love it,\u201d Luke said. \u201cHe\u2019ll definitely tell me what I can improve on, what I did good. I love that relationship. I\u2019ve had that my whole life when it came to any sport.\u201d Jon, who coached the defensive backs at Oklahoma when Tech coach Justin Fuente was the Sooners\u2019 scout team quarterback, is cautious not to cross the line into interfering with the instruction Luke gets from his Hokies coaches. \u201cIf he wants me to interact on something, he\u2019ll ask me,\u201d Jon said. \u201cMake them ask you, don\u2019t tell them. I\u2019ll tell my players, but they\u2019re my players. It\u2019s a little bit different.\u201d Jon\u2019s influence on Luke isn\u2019t just about technique and fundamentals, however. The 63-year-old Ohio native raised all three of his sons to value effort and hard work and to take competition seriously, though Jon said Dori deserves much of the credit for that, too. \u201cThe way I was raised by my dad, my mom, and watching my two older brothers grow up, being athletes, a lot of that rubbed off on me about the seriousness of the sport we\u2019re doing,\u201d Luke said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m just glad I was able to be raised that way and learn from him.\u201d Fuente recalled seeing Jon Tenuta at a bowl game and giving him a glowing update on his son. \u201cI just said, \u2018I just want you to know, not only is Luke going to be a really good player, but he, basically, has not made a mistake since he\u2019s been here,\u2019\u201d Fuente said. \u201c\u2018He hasn\u2019t been late for a meeting. He hasn\u2019t missed anything. He turns his assignments in. He\u2019s never on a list. He\u2019s just been fantastic.\u2019 And Jon looked at me and said, \u2018Don\u2019t worry about it. He won\u2019t.\u2019\u201d Last season, Luke played in all 13 Tech games, making five starts at right tackle. This year, he has been the team\u2019s starter, except for two games he missed, an absence he described as \u201cCOVID-related.\u201d The offensive line has helped the Hokies lead the ACC in rushing, averaging 290.2 yards per game and 6.4 yards per rush. They\u2019ve also allowed just 12 sacks in six games, tied for third fewest in the league. Luke\u2019s success has been enjoyable for Matt to see. It makes all the bruises worthwhile.","604":"The Virginia football team\u2019s upset victory over North Carolina re-energized fans, giving them hope for a strong finish to the season after a 1-4 start. \u201cWe\u2019re just getting started,\u201d quarterback Brennan Armstrong said after the 44-41 win. The Cavaliers sit at 2-4 overall and in the ACC, waiting to play on Nov. 14 after positive COVID-19 tests within Louisville\u2019s program delayed the team\u2019s Nov. 7 contest with the Cardinals. Both sides are hopeful they can play. UVa hopes it can build on the momentum generated in the upset victory over the Tar Heels. With Louisville, Abilene Christian, Florida State, Boston College and Virginia Tech left on the schedule, there\u2019s potential for the Cavaliers to finish the regular season with a winning record. Through the first half of its season, Virginia has been inconsistent. The Cavaliers performed admirably against Clemson, Miami and North Carolina, but dropped games to N.C. State and Wake Forest by 17 points apiece. Bronco Mendenhall\u2019s team, despite inconsistent stretches, believes in itself. The Cavaliers haven\u2019t performed up to their standards consistently, but they\u2019ve shown flashes of being a top-5 ACC team. Let\u2019s take a closer look at UVa\u2019s grades through six games this fall. Offense: C+ UVa\u2019s offense grades out at slightly above average. Several times this fall, the Virginia offense looked like a top-tier ACC unit, including in the team\u2019s 44-point showing against North Carolina. Other times, like the middle of the Miami loss and for much of the N.C. State game, the Cavaliers\u2019 offense showed significant need for development. With quarterback Bryce Perkins and wide receivers Hasise Dubois and Joe Reed gone, the need for development makes sense. When Brennan Armstrong is healthy, UVa\u2019s offense looks decent, though. The first year-starter gives the Cavaliers a passing and running threat when he\u2019s on the field. \u201cI thought he played an amazing game and that\u2019s just the beginning,\u201d Mendenhall said after the win over UNC. \u201cAs we saw from the Duke game to the Clemson game when he had a chance to go back-to-back, now you see Miami to this game back-to-back. He has such an amazing future in running and throwing and leading.\u201d The Cavaliers are averaging 27.3 points per game and 412.7 yards per contest, although Armstrong missed the second half against N.C. State and the entire contest against Wake Forest. Both the scoring and yardage marks are respectable, but the Cavaliers would certainly like more consistent production on the scoreboard. At times this fall, yards have not translated into touchdowns. Third-down conversions remain a key area for improvement entering the final stretch this fall as well. Virginia converts just 31.6% of its third-down attempts. Fortunately for the Wahoos, a 14-for-20 mark on fourth down helps mask some of the third-down shortcomings. A lead tailback would also prove valuable as the season winds down. Wayne Taulapapa leads the team\u2019s rushers with 330 yards on the ground, averaging 4.6 yards per carry. Shane Simpson rattled off 70 rushing yards in the win over North Carolina, and he sits at 178 rushing yards on the season on 31 attempts. Using quarterbacks Iraken Armstead and Keytaon Thompson adds a dynamic dimension to the rushing attack. Armstead will miss the rest of the fall with injury, but Thompson figures to see significant usage the rest of the way. Thompson lined up at quarterback, running back and wide receiver against the Tar Heels. \u201cIt\u2019s been very fun, very exciting, always learning something,\u201d Thompson said of playing different roles. Indiana transfer Ronnie Walker Jr. is expected to be available when the Cavaliers next play, potentially giving UVa a third running back threat. Armstrong leads the team in carries and he\u2019s taken a handful of big hits this fall. He left the N.C. State and UNC games with injuries and missed the Wake Forest contest. Increased production from running backs would take the pressure off Armstrong to perform on the ground, helping him avoid hits in the running game. While the Cavaliers want better performance from running backs, the offense averages 171.7 rushing yards per contest. That\u2019s a decent number for the Wahoos, and the offensive line deserves credit for being solid all season long. Defense: C- Entering the fall, UVa\u2019s defense seemed like the cornerstone of this year\u2019s team. Instead, the Cavaliers are allowing an average of 33 points per contest. That falls below the team\u2019s standard and expectations. Clemson, North Carolina and Wake Forest all reached or surpassed 40 points against the Wahoos. The offense possessed enough firepower to beat North Carolina. Even so, the Cavaliers allowed 443 passing yards to the Tar Heels. \u201cWhat has to improve is you have to win the one-on-one matchups,\u201d defensive coordinator Nick Howell said. In fairness to the defense and the secondary, injuries have played a role in the lack of consistency. Safeties Joey Blount and Brenton Nelson suffered injuries early in the season, and they\u2019ve both missed the games against Miami and North Carolina. A healthy defense matters. On the other hand, N.C. State eclipsed 30 points against the Wahoos and allowing big plays has been an issue for the secondary all fall, even when fully healthy. UVa\u2019s defense needs improvement, especially in the back end. Defensive line play will be a challenge the rest of the way with Richard Burney out for the season with a health issue. Experienced depth at the defensive line spot is minimal. Charles Snowden has tallied five sacks in the past two games, providing important production at the outside linebacker position. With the defensive line not creating a ton of pressure, Snowden\u2019s athleticism off the edge provides a valuable spark for the Wahoos. \u201cHe\u2019s got havoc written all over him,\u201d linebacker Nick Jackson said of Snowden. There\u2019s potential for Snowden and the Cavaliers to finish the final games of the regular season strong. That depends on limiting big plays and returning to full health. Special Teams: C- Virginia\u2019s fall season started with a fumbled kickoff return. The Cavaliers gave up a long opening kickoff return in its second game of the fall. They fumbled another kickoff in their loss to Wake Forest. \u201cI think our special teams have been poor, collectively,\u201d Mendenhall said in early October. Sloppy special teams play helped define the early part of the season. Fortunately for UVa, the play has improved in recent games. D\u2019Angelo Amos, a James Madison transfer, blocked a field goal attempt in UVa\u2019s victory over Miami. Virginia used a fake punt in its win over UNC to seal the game late. The play marked the second successful fake punt of the fall. Earlier this season, a Nash Griffin pass helped set up a touchdown in the N.C. State loss. Griffin offers consistency, averaging 43.5 yards per punt. Seven of his 27 punts were downed inside the opposing team\u2019s 20-yard line, and eight of his punts traveled at least 50 yards. Brian Delaney sits at 6-for-8 on field goal attempts this fall. He\u2019s been decent for UVa. Justin Duenkel took over kickoff duties for Delaney, showcasing a strong leg capable of creating touchbacks. Unfortunately for the Wahoos, they\u2019ve knocked four kickoffs out of bounds, with two coming from Delaney and two from Duenkel. UVa averages 8.6 yards per punt return and 20.9 yards per kickoff return. There\u2019s need for more production out of the return game, and the unit has seen a dramatic decline after years of Joe Reed owning the role. Overall, UVa\u2019s special teams play has been slightly below average. Key plays in recent weeks help the Cavaliers earn a grade above a D. Coaching: B+ A few sloppy execution mistakes from the Wahoos keep the coaches from earning an A, but they deserve credit for the performance this fall. Yes, the Cavaliers sit at 2-4 overall on the season and they lost winnable games to N.C. State and Wake Forest. On the flip side, the Virginia players clearly believe in Mendenhall and UVa\u2019s culture. Every player who spoke to the media after the team\u2019s sluggish start stressed the same things. They believed they needed to execute better, but they also believed they were better than their 1-4 record indicated. With the win over North Carolina and an easier schedule in the second half of the season, the Cavaliers can still salvage a winning season despite playing during a pandemic and breaking in a new starting quarterback. \u201cEvery team that we played this year, I think we could\u2019ve [beaten],\u201d offensive lineman Chris Glaser said before facing UNC. Glaser went on to add that \u201cjust because their ranked, it doesn\u2019t matter to me.\u201d Despite a 1-4 record, UVa believed it could beat a top-15 team. The belief ultimately resulted in a victory. The overall fall record makes UVa fans frustrated \u2014 and it should \u2014 but the belief within the team that the season isn\u2019t lost is a direct result of the culture created by Mendenhall and his coaching staff. It\u2019s up to the Cavaliers to execute more consistently in all three phases to turn the potential of a winning season into reality.","605":"Virginia\u2019s coaching staff challenged Charles Snowden after the team\u2019s first few games this fall. They wanted more from the dynamic NFL prospect, who recorded 22 tackles and no sacks in the team\u2019s first four games. The senior linebacker rose to the occasion in UVa\u2019s games against Miami and North Carolina. He recorded a whopping four sacks against the Tar Heels, including a stretch where he tallied sacks on three consecutive UNC offensive plays. After the slow start through four weeks, Snowden logged 18 tackles, 7.5 tackles for loss and five sacks in UVa\u2019s last two outings. The five sacks match his total from the entire 2019 season. \u201cCharles Snowden is an electric player,\u201d sophomore linebacker Nick Jackson said after the North Carolina win. \u201cHe\u2019s got havoc written all over him. When you see 11 on the field, it\u2019s really comforting, because he\u2019s a playmaker and he just made plays all night long.\u201d Snowden, a vocal leader for the Wahoos, felt equal parts relieved and pleased to post two elite performances. He\u2019s been asked in most media sessions about his lack of production, spending the first few weeks of the year talking about why he\u2019s fallen short of preseason hype. In the past two games, he\u2019s surpassed all preseason expectations. \u201cIt impacts the team in a lot of different ways,\u201d head coach Bronco Mendenhall said. \u201cHis leadership becomes stronger. His presence becomes greater. His messaging becomes more impactful. And our team becomes better.\u201d UVa\u2019s defense relies on production from the outside linebackers. The Cavaliers need Snowden to play well. While they don\u2019t necessarily need multiple sacks per game, when he\u2019s able to generate plays behind the line of scrimmage, it helps the defensive effort. Snowden\u2019s play feels even more important given the current state of the secondary. Virginia struggles to stop explosive plays, especially those in the downfield passing game. Part of that problem stems from injuries keeping safeties Joey Blount and Brenton Nelson sidelined. Without its usual group of healthy starters, opponents take advantage. North Carolina passed for 443 yards against the Wahoos. \u201cWhen you get to a quarterback and sack him, as frequently as we did with their quarterback and then causing fumbles that\u2019s one less time he can throw it about 50 yards downfield to really fast and talented receivers,\u201d Mendenhall said. \u201cThose are huge plays that we have to have in order to have success with this year\u2019s team and really almost any team.\u201d Noticing Snowden\u2019s dip in production, UVa tried to limit some of his reps in practice. Mendenhall says Snowden\u2019s high motor during practice on defense and special teams can often lead to him being worn out. Earlier this fall, the Cavaliers tried to limit Snowden\u2019s snaps in games to keep him fresh. While depth at linebacker still makes this feasible, the coaches believe they\u2019ve done a better job managing him during practices to ensure he isn\u2019t quite as fatigued during games. \u201cWe\u2019ve learned to manage him at a higher level,\u201d Mendenhall said. \u201cHe\u2019s learned to manage himself at a higher level, but the last two games have been kind of a launch point for him and our team has noticed that and we needed for this season.\u201d After being challenged, Snowden stepped into his role effectively and showcased why he\u2019s arguably the team\u2019s best defender. \u201cObviously we\u2019re pleased,\u201d defensive coordinator Nick Howell said. \u201cHe\u2019s just stuck with it and good things have happened to him, and I\u2019m really happy for him.\u201d The coaches aren\u2019t the only ones excited about the recent results. Snowden shared a few sentimental comments after the UNC victory. \u201cWho knows how many more night games I\u2019ll get in Scott Stadium,\u201d Snowden said. \u201cIt\u2019s really starting to set in, and it\u2019s increasing urgency.\u201d The senior with NFL dreams knows his UVa career may soon end. With the team sitting at 1-4 before beating UNC, Snowden and fellow upperclassmen felt an increased need to start winning and making plays. It\u2019s an unusual fall with limited crowds and COVID-19 leading to schedule changes, but most Saturdays the Wahoos still take the field playing the same game they\u2019ve played for years. Snowden and company want to make sure they end the season the right way. \u201cI\u2019ve gotten off to a slow start this year and so now to finally be producing and making plays, it feels great,\u201d Snowden said.","606":"Injuries and COVID-19 kept the Virginia women\u2019s soccer team without its full arsenal of players for most of this fall. Even with the depleted roster, Steve Swanson\u2019s team scratched and clawed its way to 7-2-1 overall record and a 5-2-1 mark in official ACC matches. The Cavaliers enter Tuesday\u2019s ACC Tournament as the No. 3 seed, and they\u2019re capable of winning the tournament \u2014 largely due to improved health. \u201cI think we\u2019re in a [better] position simply because we have most of our personnel back,\u201d Swanson said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a couple players, but for the most part we\u2019re in a much better position than we were maybe midway through the season or at any point during the season. That gives us confidence, but you have to go out and perform.\u201d One of the players who missed time with injury is Alexa Spaanstra. The talented junior from Michigan was a second team All-ACC performer a season ago, and she\u2019s excelled when healthy this season. Spaanstra missed nearly a month from the end of September into mid-October. In her four matches since returning from injury, she\u2019s scored four goals. Her first game back came against Louisville on Oct. 15. \u201cI think just being back with the team was super-exciting and really motivating, and I just wanted to be the best possible teammate I could and help in any way to get the result that we wanted,\u201d Spaanstra said. She delivered on that hope, recording each of the team\u2019s goals in the 2-0 win over Louisville. Spaanstra hopes to build off her performance against Louisville when the teams meet Tuesday at 8 p.m. in Cary, N.C., in the ACC quarterfinals. Should the Cavaliers advance past the Cardinals, they may face matchups with undefeated foes. A win over Louisville would pit the Wahoos against the winner of Virginia Tech and undefeated North Carolina. The second-seeded Tar Heels are a perfect 9-0 this fall, and they beat the Cavaliers in overtime in last season\u2019s ACC championship match. A potential rematch with Florida State \u2014 the Seminoles beat the Cavaliers 3-2 earlier this fall in Charlottesville \u2014 could await in the championship match. Florida State is a perfect 8-0 this fall and is the ACC\u2019s No. 1 seed. Advancing through the tournament presents a major challenge each step of the way. On the bright side, the Cavaliers take the pitch to start postseason play on Nov. 10. That\u2019s nine days after the team\u2019s most recent regular-season game, a 5-3 win over Syracuse. The time off gives the Cavaliers a chance to develop much-needed chemistry as players work back into the lineup after missing action. \u201cIt\u2019s been a real positive for us because we\u2019ve had players that have been out for two weeks or three weeks,\u201d Swanson said, \u201cso it gives us a chance to train and get them back in and get us on the same page and develop a little continuity here heading into the ACCs.\u201d Swanson also used the time away from competition to focus on a couple key areas for improvement. He\u2019s disappointed in the team\u2019s defense on set plays and believes there\u2019s room for growth in that department. He also wants his team \u2014 which did score five times in its latest showing \u2014 to become more consistent in finishing scoring chances. The Cavaliers haven\u2019t always been healthy this fall, and they\u2019ve played below their standard at times. At the same time, UVa sits at 7-2-1 overall and enters the ACC Tournament with a healthier roster and a motivated team. The Cavaliers know they face a stiff test in getting to the ACC championship match, but they\u2019re thankful to be closing in on the end of a full fall season. A few months ago, with the pandemic jeopardizing the return of fall sports, a shot at winning a conference title this fall seemed unlikely. \u201cIf you would have asked us at the beginning of the fall if we\u2019d be in this position, I think the majority of us would\u2019ve doubted you and said, \u2018There\u2019s no way,\u2019\u201d Spaanstra said. \u201cI think we\u2019re really excited and grateful that we have this opportunity to compete for an ACC championship.\u201d","607":"The test results, which were shared by the athletic department on Monday, were administered on Nov. 2-8 and just one positive result means the percent positivity rate sits at about 0.1%. UVa began testing student-athletes and staff members on July 5, when the football team returned to Charlottesville. Since then, the athletic department has administered 10,800 tests. Of those tests, 92 came back positive, which is good for a positivity rate of just under 1%. The one person who tested positive for COVID-19 in the most recent round of testing will self-isolate for a minimum of 10 days. UVa\u2019s medical staff also evaluates all student-athletes who test positive before allowing them to return to action. Any close contacts of individuals who test positive will self-quarantine for two weeks. Virginia\u2019s recent testing numbers, including this latest round of results, have been low. Last week, the athletic department shared results from 1,038 COVID-19 tests. Only two people \u2014 both were staff members \u2014 tested positive for the virus. The week prior to that, UVa shared results from 985 tests, and just two people tested positive for COVID-19 in that batch of tests. As last week showed, however, low percent positivity numbers don\u2019t necessarily mean the Cavaliers are safe from schedule alterations. The team\u2019s football game scheduled for Nov. 7 was moved to Nov. 14 due to positive COVID-19 test results within Louisville\u2019s football program. Even as UVa\u2019s numbers remain low, issues with other programs can cause schedule changes. On the bright side, UVa\u2019s athletic department is doing its part to safely take the field given the current protocols and guidelines.","608":"Virginia\u2019s scheduled football game with Louisville last Saturday was postponed due to COVID-19 issues within the Cardinals\u2019 program. Fortunately for both UVa and Louisville, both teams were off this upcoming Saturday. With less than a week until this week\u2019s scheduled showdown, Virginia head coach Bronco Mendenhall says all indications are that both programs will be healthy and ready to compete this weekend. \u201cBoth teams are anticipating playing now,\u201d Mendenhall said Monday. With the game set for this Saturday, the Cavaliers enjoyed a surprise off weekend last Saturday. UVa remains locked into preparation for Louisville. While not playing Saturday came as a surprise, the opponent for this upcoming weekend remains the same. The Cardinals possess a dynamic offensive attack that can turn missed tackles into touchdowns in a hurry. Defensively, Louisville\u2019s defense struggles at times, opening up opportunities for Virginia to score in bunches. On the bright side, the Cavaliers received a few extra days of rest before hosting the Cardinals. \u201cI really appreciated it now, just because it\u2019s been a pretty long season so far,\u201d defensive tackle Adeeb Atariwa said. Atariwa is projected as a starter along the defensive line with Richard Burney out for the season. He\u2019s grateful for the extra time to prepare for Louisville\u2019s rushing attack, which is led by speedy running back Javian Hawkins. \u201cThey run the stretch really well,\u201d Atariwa said. \u201cStopping the run game, being able to contain that and getting after them is really something that is key in this game. They have an o-line that works in unison, and you don\u2019t see that very often.\u201d Stopping the run seems like priority No. 1 for the Cavaliers heading into Saturday. Bye week viewership Mendenhall says he spent part of Saturday outside enjoying the beautiful weekend in Charlottesville. He also watched college football during the unexpected bye. Mendenhall sat down for the entirety of Notre Dame\u2019s 47-40 win over Clemson in double overtime. It\u2019s the first full game Mendenhall has sat down to watch live in years. Understandably, he\u2019s usually busy coaching his own team or dissecting game film. \u201cWhat a great game,\u201d he said. Interestingly, and perhaps relatable to some, Mendenhall watched the contest with the game muted. The decision was made by Mendenhall\u2019s wife, Holly. She opts to mute the games because Bronco can\u2019t flip off his football mind, instead analyzing every play and how the broadcast crew responds to developments on the field. \u201cIt\u2019s just so frustrating to her,\u201d Mendenhall said. \u201cWe have a rule \u2013 and I don\u2019t even know if I should share this but I\u2019m going to \u2013 when we watch the games we have the announcers turned off because how I react to them and what they\u2019re seeing and what I think is accurate really doesn\u2019t match most of the time, and so she just turns the volume off.\u201d Mendenhall says the muting first started with family members watching games he coached. As announcers might\u2019ve made overly inflating or degrading comments about BYU or UVa, family members opted to mute the TV. The same is now true when he watches with his wife, only for a different reason. Injury updates Safeties Joey Blount and Brenton Nelson are among UVa\u2019s list of injured players. The two dynamic defensive backs remain questionable for this weekend\u2019s matchup with Louisville. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be enough time,\u201d Mendenhall said. Virginia\u2019s head coach says he believes the weekend off \u201cwill help some\u201d with returning players to full strength, but some of the injuries may linger. He didn\u2019t offer a specific timetable for the return of Blount or Nelson. If those players are unavailable to go Saturday, D\u2019Angelo Amos and Antonio Clary are likely to continue filling in at the safety positions. \u201cHe\u2019s played better and better each time, the more reps he gets, the more plays he has, he\u2019s playing better,\u201d Amos, a graduate transfer, said of Clary\u2019s recent performance. Up next Due to last week\u2019s schedule change, the Cavaliers\u2019 bye week passed. After hosting Louisville this weekend, the Wahoos will host FCS program Abilene Christian on Nov. 21. The game will kick off at 4 p.m. and air on regional sports networks. It\u2019s the first UVa game this fall that won\u2019t air on the ACC Network.","609":"After a whirlwind ending to its 2019-20 season, the Virginia men\u2019s basketball team is nearing a return to the court. The Cavaliers haven\u2019t played a game since March, when the COVID-19 pandemic ended its season before postseason play. With a core group of contributors returning and Tony Bennett at the helm, the Wahoos enter the season with plenty of expectations. As is standard, the Cavaliers say they\u2019re ignoring the preseason hype, but they are excited for the season to tip off in the coming weeks. They returned to Charlottesville weeks ago, and they\u2019re ready to take the court in meaningful games. \u201cIt\u2019s been crazy,\u201d junior guard Kihei Clark said. \u201cI went home for the most amount of time I\u2019ve ever been home since I went here at UVa, but just been glad to be here on campus and be able to work with the guys. It\u2019s been a great experience, something we\u2019ll never forget. Looking back, we know we put in the work, and I know we can\u2019t wait to get on the floor and compete.\u201d Competing and practicing during a pandemic requires health protocols not required during typical seasons. Distancing, limiting contact and mask-wearing are important for players and coaches ahead of this season. Bennett said despite some contact tracing of managers and a couple of student-athletes contracting the virus away from UVa during the summer, the Cavaliers have largely done well to reduce positive tests within the program. That\u2019s reflected in overall UVa athletic numbers. The athletic department recorded just one positive COVID-19 test from Nov. 2-8. \u201cWe\u2019ve pretty much been able to practice without interruption,\u201d Bennett said. At the same time, it\u2019s a challenge to coach during the pandemic. Typically, Bennett\u2019s staff leads the team with a hands-on approach, whether it\u2019s working a player through a drill or pulling them aside for a close conversation to explain a point. \u201cThe connectedness is a challenge,\u201d Bennett said, \u201cYou realize how much physical touch is important when you just like put your arm around a player or pat them on the back or whatever, and you don\u2019t do that as much.\u201d Playing in 2020 requires patience and a willingness to follow the health protocols. In Bennett\u2019s eyes, that\u2019s all worth it as long as the Wahoos can play. \u201cYou feel a little disconnected, but again, I always say it beats the alternative,\u201d Bennett said. Determining a rotation With a little over two weeks until the start of the season, Bennett sounds like he\u2019s taking an all-hands-on-deck type approach to the season. He didn\u2019t name a starting unit Monday, but a few players seem like obvious candidates to start. Clark, who played an important role in each of his first two seasons, should start at point guard. Sam Hauser, a Marquette transfer on the wing, likely lands a starting role. The same is true for center Jay Huff. Outside of those three, Bennett possesses plenty of options within the rotation. At shooting guard, he can call on Tomas Woldetensae or Casey Morsell. Both saw time last season. Kody Stattmann, another option at shooting guard, actually grew over the summer. He\u2019s up to about 6-foot-8, and Bennett says he\u2019s taller than Hauser. At power forward and center, Justin McKoy, Kadin Shedrick and Francisco Caffaro figure to be in the mix for minutes. UVa\u2019s three marquee freshmen also figure to compete for minutes. Reece Beekman seems destined to back up Clark at point guard, while Carson McCorkle could find time at shooting guard. Jabri Abdur-Rahim can score in multiple ways, making him an option at small forward or shooting guard. \u201cI think the best team will hopefully be put on the floor, and whether that\u2019s nine, 10, eight, whatever, so be it,\u201d Bennett said. Bennett did mention that given the NCAA\u2019s decision to award all winter sport athletes an extra year of eligibility regardless of playing time this season, redshirting doesn\u2019t make much sense. A player who Bennett might\u2019ve redshirted this season could very well see action in a few games since it won\u2019t count against a player\u2019s eligibility in future seasons. \u201cA redshirt year, I mean I guess you could, certainly if there\u2019s an injury, but it\u2019s neither here nor there to be honest if you\u2019re going to get your eligibility back,\u201d Bennett said. UVa\u2019s head coach didn\u2019t rule out the possibility of Rice transfer Trey Murphy III becoming immediately eligible and potentially playing this season. Earlier this offseason, Murphy III and the coaching staff discussed having the transfer redshirt to gain strength in preparation for future seasons. It\u2019s possible that thinking could change given the eligibility decisions by the NCAA. If he\u2019s deemed eligible, there\u2019s a chance he could play sooner rather than later. UVa No. 4 in AP poll The preseason expectations are high for the Virginia men\u2019s basketball team. The Wahoos enter the season as the No. 4 team in the preseason AP top 25. Villanova, which is expected to play UVa this season, checks in at No. 3. Baylor sits at No. 2 and Gonzaga enters the season as the top-ranked team. The Cavaliers earned one first-place vote. \u201cIt feels nice, but we know it doesn\u2019t really mean much,\u201d Clark said. \u201cWhen it\u2019s time to step out on the floor, our rankings don\u2019t really matter. It\u2019s just whoever plays better that day, so you gotta still prepare the right way and just come in with the same mindset every game.\u201d Three other ACC teams earned spots in the top 25. Duke comes in at No. 9, giving the ACC a pair of top-10 teams. North Carolina slides in at No. 16 despite a lackluster 2019-20 campaign, and Florida State earns the No. 21 spot in the poll. The Seminoles finished first in the ACC a season ago.","610":"A busy week in the Virginia sports world continued Tuesday with the release of basketball news. Tony Bennett\u2019s team learned its full 2020-21 schedule, while Tina Thompson and the women\u2019s team may have received an added piece of motivation entering this season when they saw their projected ACC finish. Additionally, the Virginia athletic department reiterated the current attendance guidelines for large gatherings. Barring changes in the commonwealth of Virginia\u2019s health guidelines, Virginia basketball games will likely feature a similar number of fans to the Cavaliers\u2019 football games. On the gridiron, Virginia starting quarterback Brennan Armstrong spoke with the media ahead of the Cavaliers\u2019 Saturday showdown with Louisville. He\u2019s recovering from a knee injury suffered against North Carolina, but feels healthy enough to take the field. Hoops attendance capped The UVa men\u2019s basketball team\u2019s schedule release on Tuesday also included a brief note about capacity guidelines at basketball home games. Current guidelines in the commonwealth of Virginia limit capacity to a maximum of 1,000 people. That guideline also applies to football games, which is why attendance at Scott Stadium has been limited to 1,000 fans at games this fall. While family members of coaches and players have been allowed to attend football games this fall, it\u2019s unclear who will be allowed to watch UVa home basketball games in person this season. \u201cMen\u2019s basketball season ticket holders and UVa students will receive communication directly from the UVa Athletics Ticket Office about attendance plans for the 2020-21 season,\u201d the release said. Capacity guidelines for all UVa sporting events are subject to change. Attendance rules and limitations could change during the season, depending on how the spread of COVID-19 goes in future weeks and months. Any changes will stem from decisions made by state and local health officials. Low expectations  The Virginia women\u2019s basketball team was picked to finish last in the 15-team ACC by the league\u2019s head coaches on Tuesday. The Blue Ribbon Panel pegged the Cavaliers to finish 14th. No UVa players made the newcomer watch list or the preseason All-ACC team. Jocelyn Willoughby, the team\u2019s top player a season ago, graduated and currently plays in the WNBA. With Willoughby gone, the Cavaliers lack experience. Virginia\u2019s roster features 10 underclassmen when counting redshirt sophomore Amandine Toi as an underclassmen despite her entering her third season within the program. Unfortunately for the Cavaliers, talented underclassmen Shemera Williams and Kylie Kornegay-Lucas opted to transfer after making contributions as freshmen a season ago. Their absence leaves head coach Tina Thompson looking at other newcomers to make a major impact this season. Enter the year expectations are low for the Cavaliers, but there\u2019s potential to develop a young roster into an ACC contender in the next few seasons. Armstrong expects to play Saturday After leaving the North Carolina game with a knee injury, UVa starting quarterback Brennan Armstrong expects to play Saturday against Louisville. He is receiving treatment on his injured knee, but says he\u2019s fine to go for Saturday. \u201cI\u2019m feeling good,\u201d Armstrong said. \u201cI\u2019ve just been rehabbing my knee. Lot of good positive things came back. Nothing\u2019s too much wrong with my knee. Just wearing a brace now and we\u2019re still rolling, preparing for Louisville and getting ready to go.\u201d It\u2019s unclear if the Wahoos may opt to run Armstrong less, given his banged-up knee. He also suffered a concussion earlier this fall. Armstrong led the Cavaliers with 20 rushing attempts in the victory over North Carolina. No other Virginia player recorded more than 10 rushing attempts.","611":"The Virginia men\u2019s basketball team was selected by media members as the favorite to win the 2020-21 ACC men\u2019s basketball championship on Wednesday. It\u2019s the first time since 1982-83 that the Cavaliers enter the season as the conference title favorite. Sam Hauser, a Marquette transfer, earned a spot on the preseason All-ACC first team, and he received the second-most preseason Player of the Year votes. North Carolina\u2019s Garrison Brooks won preseason Player of the Year honors. Kihei Clark earned one vote for preseason Player of the Year and earned a spot on the preseason All-ACC second team. Freshman guard Reece Beekman earned three votes for preseason ACC Freshman of the Year. This marks the first time in the Tony Bennett era that the Cavaliers are picked to win the league, even though Virginia has finished first in the conference standings four times during his tenure. UVa enters the 2020-21 season ranked No. 4 in the AP poll\u2019s preseason top 25. Bennett\u2019s team returns a handful of key contributors from a team that went 23-7 overall and 15-5 in the ACC last year. After a rocky start to conference play, the Cavaliers won 11 of their final 12 games before the COVID-19 pandemic halted the season. UVa ended the year on an eight-game winning streak. Clark and Jay Huff headline the group of returners. Clark enters the year as one of the top point guards in the nation, while Huff possesses NBA potential at the center spot. Bennett\u2019s team features plenty of depth at guard with the addition of Beekman as well as the return of shooting guards Casey Morsell, Kody Stattmann and Tomas Woldetensae. At power forward and center, Justin McKoy and Francisco Caffaro are expected to log minutes. Freshman Jabri Abdur-Rahim figures to compete for minutes at the guard and small forward spots. Leading the way at small forward is, of course, Hauser. The Marquette transfer sat out last season due to NCAA transfer rules, but he\u2019s familiar with UVa\u2019s system from last season. At Marquette, he averaged 14.9 points and 7.2 rebounds per game in 2018-19. He\u2019s a 44.5% shooter from the 3-point line during his college career, and he shot an impressive 92.4% from the free-throw line in 2018-19. Hauser and the Wahoos start their 2020-21 season on Nov. 25 against Maine.","612":"The victory for the Irish also moves them into the No. 1 spot in the power poll. Elsewhere, Virginia Tech fell to in-state foe Liberty, suffering its third loss of the fall. The Flames, after their upset win over the Hokies, have a legitimate case that they\u2019re the best football team in the commonwealth of Virginia. 1. Notre Dame (7-0, 6-0 ACC, No. 2 last week): For the first time all season, a team other than Clemson claims the top spot in the power poll. A thrilling 47-40 double overtime victory over the Tigers gives the Fighting Irish an ideal path to the ACC Championship Game. Notre Dame also sits in prime position to make the College Football Playoff. At the same time, injuries and the absence of Trevor Lawrence due to COVID-19 played a role in the upset win. A rematch in the conference title game could lead to different results. Next: at Boston College, Saturday, 3:30 p.m. 2. Clemson (7-1, 6-1 ACC, No. 1 last week): The Tigers dropped their first ACC game since 2017, falling to Notre Dame in double overtime. The Tigers will be fine. Getting players back and healthy is the team\u2019s biggest concern moving forward. Clemson needs to win out to guarantee its spot in the conference championship game. Next: Bye 3. Miami (6-1, 5-1 ACC, No. 3 last week): The Hurricanes gutted out a 44-41 win over N.C. State thanks in large part due to an amazing performance from starting quarterback D\u2019Eriq King, who went 31-for-41 for 430 yards and five passing touchdowns. He also added 105 rushing yards on 15 carries. King carried his team to a comeback win. Next: at Virginia Tech, Saturday, noon 4. North Carolina (5-2, 5-2 ACC, No. 5 last week): When North Carolina plays to its potential, it\u2019s one of the best teams in the ACC. Inconsistency and a mediocre defense lead to losses for the Tar Heels. Fortunately for Mack Brown\u2019s team, there was plenty of offense Saturday, when North Carolina rolled past Duke 56-24. Next: vs. Wake Forest, Saturday, noon 5. N.C. State (4-3, 4-3 ACC, No. 7 last week): N.C. State pushed Miami to the brink, blowing a game it likely should\u2019ve won. Regardless, it was a better performance than the previous game, when the Wolfpack were drubbed by North Carolina, 48-21. N.C. State could very easily win out this season with Florida State, Liberty, Syracuse and Georgia Tech left on the schedule. Next: vs. Florida State, Saturday, 7:30 p.m. 6. Wake Forest (4-2, 3-2 ACC, No. 8 last week): The Demon Deacons were off last week, using an extra week to prepare for an interesting matchup with North Carolina. The Tar Heels are good, but they\u2019ve shown weaknesses this fall. Wake Forest enters the game winners of four straight. Next: at North Carolina, Saturday, noon 7. Boston College (5-3, 4-3 ACC, No. 6 last week): Perhaps a bit emotionally drained from nearly beating Clemson, Boston College narrowly defeated Syracuse 16-13 last weekend. Despite the iffy showing, the Eagles picked up another win. They\u2019ve now alternated wins and losses in seven consecutive games. They\u2019d love to break that streak and start a winning streak this weekend. Next: vs. Notre Dame, Saturday 3:30 p.m. 8. Virginia Tech (4-3, 4-2 ACC, No. 4 last week): Saturday was tough for Virginia Tech fans. The Hokies dropped a heartbreaker, falling to Liberty 38-35 on a last-second 51-yard field goal. It was yet another loss as a double-digit favorite for the Hokies, who seem prone to upset defeats. Somewhat surprisingly, they\u2019re a favorite this weekend against a top-10 foe. Next: vs. Miami, Saturday, noon 9. Virginia (2-4, 2-4 ACC, No. 9 last week): Virginia enjoyed an unexpected bye week last week after COVID-19 issues with Louisville\u2019s program led to a one-week postponement. The Cavaliers rested up and feel confident after beating North Carolina in their latest game. They\u2019ll look to win two games in a row for the first time this fall. Next: vs. Louisville, Saturday, 3:30 p.m. 10. Pittsburgh (4-4, 3-4 ACC, No. 10 last week): The Panthers finally ended their four-game losing streak, beating Florida State 41-17. Kenny Pickett played well at quarterback, completing 21 of his 27 passes for 210 yards. Three interceptions from a trio of Florida State quarterbacks certainly helped Pitt pick up the win. Next: at Georgia Tech, Saturday, 7 p.m. 11. Georgia Tech (2-5, 2-4 ACC, No. 11 last week): The Yellow Jackets were off last week, and they return from their bye to a home game with the team one place above them in the power poll. Next: vs. Pittsburgh, Saturday, 7 p.m. 12. Louisville (2-5, 1-5 ACC, No. 12 last week): The Cardinals were forced to postpone last Saturday\u2019s game at UVa due to COVID-19 issues. They\u2019re back this weekend, hoping for many of their players to get healthy as they aim to take down the Wahoos. Next: at Virginia, Saturday, 3:30 p.m. 13. Florida State (2-5, 1-5 ACC, No. 13 last week): Another poor performance from Florida State dropped the Seminoles to just 2-5 this season. FSU threw three costly interceptions in a 41-17 loss to Pitt. Next: at N.C. State, Saturday, 7:30 p.m. 14. Duke (2-6, 1-6 ACC, No. 14 last week): The Blue Devils allowed North Carolina to score the first 28 points last weekend and they trailed 42-10 at halftime. Basketball season can\u2019t get here soon enough for Duke. Next: Bye 15. Syracuse (1-7, 1-6 ACC, No. 15 last week): The Orange hung tough with Boston College, losing just 16-13. That\u2019s a positive, but the end result was still a loss. Next: Bye","613":"This season, I\u2019m joined each week by Richmond Times-Dispatch columnist David Teel, Roanoke Times Columnist Aaron McFarling and Charlottesville Daily Progress Virginia beat writer Bennett Conlin. Each week we\u2019ll pick games involving Virginia Tech and UVA, along with one other key ACC match up. Then, to create a little more separation in the standings, we\u2019ll each predict on upset against the spread from anywhere on the FBS board. Last weekend, Aaron McFarling\u2019s upset of the week \u2013 Air Force over Army \u2013 never happened, yet another victim of a COVID-19 postponement. The panel wishes the rest of the weekend never happened, as well. We combined to go 2-9. Here are this week\u2019s picks:  No. 9 Miami at Virginia Tech, noon, Lane Stadium Bennett Conlin, Charlottesville Daily Progress (17-10): Virginia Tech actually enters the game as a favorite, which might speak more to Miami\u2019s recent close-call victories than it does the Hokies\u2019 most recent efforts. I\u2019ll take D\u2019Eriq King coming off a 500-yard performance to keep things rolling in a win over the Hokies. The Pick: Miami 38, Virginia Tech 31 Aaron McFarling, Roanoke Times (16-10): This has potential to be a really fun game featuring two quarterbacks playing at a very high level. Alas, it\u2019s hard to have much faith in the Tech defense right now, and the uncertainty surrounding RB Khalil Herbert (hamstring) gives me pause. The Pick: Miami 38, Virginia Tech 30 Mike Barber, Richmond Times-Dispatch (16-11): Virginia Tech has struggled with run defense, struggled to contain mobile quarterbacks, struggled on third down and struggled allowing big plays. In roll the Hurricanes, with star QB D\u2019Eriq King and a high-scoring offense. Vegas sees the Hokies as slight home favorites. Not sure what I\u2019m missing, but I like Miami in a high-scoring affair. The Pick: Miami 45, Virginia Tech 38 David Teel, Richmond Times-Dispatch (13-14): Yes, the Hurricanes are ranked ninth, and no, I can't explain why they're 2-point pups against a Hokies bunch that just lost at home to Liberty. Tech is 0-5 versus the top 10 since winning at Ohio State in 2014, and all but one of those setbacks was by 14 points or more. PICK: Miami 35, Virginia Tech 27  Louisville at Virginia, 3:30 p.m., Scott Stadium Conlin: Quarterback Brennan Armstrong starting for UVA signals good things to come, and the extra week of rest should help as he nurses a left knee injury. Louisville struggles with consistency in all three phases, and the Cavaliers play well at Scott Stadium even with limited crowds. Both of UVA\u2019s wins this fall came in Charlottesville. The Pick: Virginia 34, Louisville 23 McFarling: A week later, I\u2019m still leaning in the same direction. The Cavaliers rank fourth in the ACC against the run. The Cardinals have covered the spread only twice in the past 11 games as a road underdog, which they are again here (+3.5) The Pick: Virginia 35, Louisville 30 Barber: It\u2019s not clear whether Virginia quarterback Brennan Armstrong could have played last weekend, after injuring his knee in the previous game, the upset win over North Carolina. This week, he\u2019s a full-go, though he will wear a brace. Louisville, meanwhile, has contained the spread of its COVID-19 outbreak, but the defense doesn\u2019t expect to have everyone available on Saturday. All of that favors the home team. The Pick: Virginia 31, Louisville 27 Teel: UVA's stout run defense limited North Carolina's exceptional rushing offense to 3.3 yards per carry two weeks ago. Reprise that effort against the Cardinals -- Javian Hawkins leads the ACC in rushing at 117.4 yards per game -- and the Cavaliers are golden. The Pick: Virginia 34, Louisville 21  No. 2 Notre Dame at Boston College, 3:30 p.m., Alumni Stadium Conlin: Notre Dame faces a pesky Boston College team on the road after an emotional double-overtime victory over Clemson. An upset shouldn\u2019t shock anyone, but the Fighting Irish should control the battle of the trenches enough to avoid a loss. The Pick: Notre Dame 27, Boston College 20 McFarling: We\u2019ll say it again: All the Eagles do is cover. They\u2019ve cashed tickets in 22 of their past 30 ACC games and 19 of their past 27 games as an underdog. A Notre Dame letdown seems predictable, making 13.5 points feel like too many. The Pick: Notre Dame 28, Boston College 24 Barber: Notre Dame is riding high after upsetting Clemson. The last time the Irish downed the No. 1 team in the nation was 1993, when it beat Florida State. The next week, it lost to Boston College on a last-second field goal. So who do the schedule maker\u2019s throw Notre Dame\u2019s way after the big win over Clemson? You guessed it. History\u2019s great, but the Irish are better. The Pick: Notre Dame 31, Boston College 24 Teel: A week after toppling No. 1 Florida State in 1993, Notre Dame lost to Boston College. Last week's victory over Clemson marked the Fighting Irish's first conquest of No. 1 since, and lo and behold, look who's next on the schedule. Not only that, Eagles quarterback Phil Jurkovec transferred to BC from Notre Dame. The Pick: Notre Dame 30, Boston College 17 Upset the week Conlin: Tulane lost to Navy earlier this season, and the Green Wave sit at 4-4 overall this fall. Army\u2019s triple-option attack should find weaknesses in Tulane\u2019s defense much like Navy did earlier this year. A win improves Army to 7-1 this fall. The Pick: Army 24, Tulane 21 McFarling: These proud programs enter the game a combined 0-5. Maybe Maryland is for real, but the Nittany Lions getting wrecked by the Terps at home last week as a 27.5-point favorite was a huge red flag. Huskers win this one as a 3-point pup. The Pick: Nebraska 30, Penn State 24 Barber: There are four intriguing home underdogs in the Big Ten this week with Minnesota, Michigan, Michigan State and Nebraska. I\u2019m taking the Spartans \u2013 yes, the ones who lost to Rutgers \u2013 to get the upset here, which means I\u2019m betting Michigan State won\u2019t turn the ball over as it much as it has going into this game. The Pick: Michigan State 31, Indiana 28 Teel: Army is clamoring to play after last week's game against Air Force was postponed due to virus concerns at Air Force. Moreover, the Black Knights are 6-1, their only setback to undefeated Cincinnati. Yet Army is a 5 1\/2-point beagle at 4-4 Tulane. The Pick: Army 38, Tulane 34","614":"Louisville head coach Scott Satterfield and Virginia head coach Bronco Mendenhall were deep into their preparation last week when the announcement came that the matchup between the Cardinals and Cavaliers was off. A postponement of the game to this Saturday came in the middle of last week, meaning game preparation for both teams was nearly complete. Game plans existed, and the additional week of preparation allowed each squad to fine-tune their plans for Saturday. \u201cMore time equals more preparation,\u201d Virginia defensive coordinator Nick Howell said. \u201cThe on-the-field product, I mean, there\u2019s no guarantee but yeah, you\u2019d like to say if you have more time, you can be more ready.\u201d At the same time, teams want to keep much of the focus on themselves and their execution. Satterfield and Louisville\u2019s game plan was just about finalized last week, and he\u2019s not putting in too much additional film study or making any drastic changes to his team\u2019s plan. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to overanalyze an opponent,\u201d Satterfield said. \u201cI\u2019ve never been in favor of that. Even when you\u2019ve had a long time or two weeks to prepare for a team, you don\u2019t ever want to overanalyze.\u201d Satterfield says when he or other coaches analyze too much, there\u2019s a temptation to put new plays into the playbook. He doesn\u2019t want to spend too much time on UVa\u2019s scheme, believing he and his staff developed a suitable plan last week. Returning to health \u2014 last week\u2019s game was postponed due to COVID-19 issues within Louisville\u2019s program \u2014 took priority for the Cardinals. Test results from early in the week yielded promising results, making both sides confident Saturday\u2019s game would occur. That gives both sides freedom to prepare for Saturday with the assumption the game takes place. When it comes to the pre-game work, UVa\u2019s players and coaches echoed similar sentiments to Louisville\u2019s staff about not wanting to prepare too much. Starting quarterback Brennan Armstrong says it\u2019s helpful to know the game plan from last week. Coming into early-week practices, the Wahoos knew what they wanted to do against the Cardinals. Instead of implementing the entire plan to rack up points against a suspect Louisville defense, Armstrong and the offense just worked on executing the current plan while tweaking aspects of it. \u201cWe had a lot in, so we\u2019re just kind of fine tuning now, and we\u2019re just gonna keep going,\u201d Armstrong said. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to be kind of ahead, though. It\u2019s kind of nice to have those practices in.\u201d The mid-week postponement threw off UVa\u2019s typical bye week plan. The Cavaliers were well into game preparations and through many of their most challenging practices by the time last week\u2019s game was postponed. Even with a rhythm-breaking postponement, the Cavaliers actually enjoyed the unexpected rest. They\u2019ve grown into a rhythm and routine and an occasional change of pace helps break up the constant grind of the season. \u201cIt was nice to have a break actually, even though we were expecting our bye week to be this weekend,\u201d Mendenhall said. \u201cWe received, or basically we executed, kind of a mini bye week. A subtle change in routine. A couple days off. A little bit of a break for our players. A chance for them to enjoy just watching college football and having a really nice weekend in Charlottesville with beautiful weather. Just a moment to pause, reflect on the first part of the season and to prepare for the second part.\u201d UVa returns from its bye week hoping to maintain momentum from its 44-41 upset victory over North Carolina. The Cavaliers and Cardinals both received unexpected bye weeks, offering them additional time to prepare for Saturday\u2019s showdown between teams toward the bottom of the ACC standings. For Louisville, the focus lied in getting its roster healthy enough to play this weekend. For UVa, the focus sat in taking a few days to rest and recharge. It was unexpected, but the Wahoos are choosing to enjoy the positives from their week off. They feel rested and prepared \u2014 but not too prepared \u2014 entering Saturday\u2019s contest. \u201cIt really is what you make it with your team,\u201d Mendenhall said. \u201cI think it was helpful from, if nothing else, just from a routine break or freshness and then return to play for the final stretch. As few days as it was, it still helped, and I\u2019m going to focus on that.\u201d","615":"Bennett Conlin's keys to victory for Saturday's matchup between Virginia and Louisville.  Virginia Maintain offensive momentum: Virginia\u2019s offense feels confident with Brennan Armstrong starting at quarterback. Despite battling a knee injury entering this week, Armstrong expects to play. After scoring 44 points against North Carolina, Virginia wants to build off that showing. Louisville\u2019s defense makes it easy to score, allowing at least 40 points to Virginia Tech, Georgia Tech and Miami. Consistently stop the run: Louisville running back Javian Hawkins leads the ACC with 117.4 rushing yards per game. The tailback is a big play waiting to happen. UVa\u2019s defense, on the other hand, ranks fourth in the ACC in rushing yards allowed per game. The Wahoos need to consistently stop Hawkins, who can quickly break off chunk gains at any moment. Take care of the ball: Armstrong didn\u2019t throw an interception against Miami, and Virginia only lost by five to a quality foe. When he only threw one interception against North Carolina, and the Cavaliers upset the Tar Heels. UVa can win games when it wins the turnover battle or at least keeps it close by taking care of the ball. That starts with Armstrong.  Louisville Score in bunches: UVa\u2019s secondary continues to battle injuries to Joey Blount and Brenton Nelson. The injuries, as well as an inability to win one-on-one battles on the outside, lend itself to poor defensive showings. Four of UVa\u2019s past five opponents have scored at least 38 points. Pressure Brennan Armstrong: Armstrong gains confidence weekly. He\u2019s starting to see the field well, and his turnover rate seems to be declining. UVa offense coordinator Robert Anae credits the offensive line for part of that growth. Louisville needs to generate pressure Saturday, despite dealing with defensive linemen missing time recently due to COVID-19. Start fast: UVa tends to start slowly, and the Cardinals play their best when they can lean on the running game. If Louisville jumps out to an early lead, the Cardinals can rely on Javian Hawkins and the ground game for most of the day. If the Cavaliers flip the script and lead by multiple scores, it forces the Cardinals to pass the ball effectively.","616":"A look at who has the edge in Saturday's ACC tilt between Virginia and Louisville.  Quarterbacks It\u2019s a tight matchup. Brennan Armstrong and Malik Cunningham both run well and can put up solid passing numbers. Interceptions hurt both QBs, who have combined to throw 15 picks this season. Both quarterbacks possess plenty of talent but perform inconsistently at times. Neither side holds a clear advantage. Edge, Push.  Running backs Ronnie Walker Jr. may finally make his UVa debut this weekend. Shane Simpson played very well against North Carolina, and Wayne Taulapapa gives Virginia a steady presence in the backfield. Javian Hawkins, however, is the best running back in this weekend\u2019s game. Edge, Louisville.  Receivers\/tight ends The return of Lavel Davis Jr. gives Virginia its deep threat back. He averages 23 yards per reception. Terrell Jana, Tony Poljan and Billy Kemp IV give Armstrong reliable options all over the field. Louisville\u2019s Tutu Atwell might be the most dynamic receiver in this game. His speed makes him a threat to score every time he touches the football. Depth at the position gives the Wahoos the nod. Edge, Virginia.  Offensive line Virginia\u2019s group is playing some of its best football of the season. Even though the Cardinals\u2019 group leans on four upperclassmen, the Cavaliers earn an edge for their performance in recent weeks. UVa's line opens running lanes and protects its passer well. Edge, Virginia.  Defensive line Richard Burney is out for the season for the Cavaliers. Louisville enters this weekend after its defensive line was the position group hit hardest by its COVID-19 outbreak. Both defensive lines may struggle Saturday, but we\u2019ll give the tiny edge to the home team since it has done well to stop the run this fall. Edge, Virginia.  Linebackers Dorian Etheridge and Monty Montgomery play exceptionally good football for the Cardinals. They\u2019re both disruptive players. Virginia again earns a small edge, largely due to the recent production of Charles Snowden, who recorded four sacks in the win over North Carolina. Edge, Virginia.  Secondary Statistically speaking, UVa ranks worst in the ACC in passing yards allowed per game and passing efficiency defense. Louisville leads the conference in passing yards per game allowed, limiting opposing teams to 53.6% completion percentage and just 194.6 yards per game.\u00a0Edge, Louisville.  Special teams The special teams stats for both sides leave plenty to be desired. Both squads are mediocre in the return game, and both sides are 6-for-8 on field goals. It\u2019s hard to love either side entering Saturday, and the edge may very well depend on the unit that happens to play better Saturday. Edge, Push.","617":"The Virginia football team left Scott Stadium on Saturday night with a 31-17 win over Louisville, its third victory of the season. It was the second win in a row for the Cavaliers, who seem to show growth weekly despite starting the season 1-4. With winnable games left on the schedule, Virginia sits in position to post its third consecutive winning season despite the subpar start. Saturday\u2019s win sets up Bronco Mendenhall\u2019s squad for a potentially strong finish to its 2020 season. UVa\u2019s performance Saturday wasn\u2019t perfect. The Wahoos allowed nearly 500 yards of offense, including 317 yards on the ground. Despite allowing a lot of yards, Virginia forced three turnovers and held Louisville to 0-2 on fourth downs. The defense allowed just 17 points and scored on an interception return for a touchdown. Offensively, the Cavaliers racked up 368 yards of offense and won the time of possession battle by roughly a minute despite Louisville holding the ball for about 10 minutes in the opening quarter. Three receivers racked up at least 40 receiving yards, and four players ran for at least 20 yards. Special teams didn\u2019t make game-changing plays, but there were quality individual efforts at times. Unlike losses to N.C. State and Wake Forest, UVa played solid in every phase of the game. There were mistakes, but they weren\u2019t back-breaking errors that compounded and took the Wahoos out of the game. More importantly, Virginia\u2019s team showed development in multiple phases. \u201cThere are things we can correct, there are things we did well and there are lessons to be learned, just like there is every week, but I feel momentum,\u201d Mendenhall said. \u201cI see some consistency moving and growing and I like how it\u2019s shaping and moving for the last part of the season.\u201d Virginia faces an FCS team next weekend before traveling to face a struggling Florida State program. The Cavaliers sit on the brink of improving to above .500 after a 1-4 start. Lavel Davis Jr. returns UVa\u2019s 6-foot-7 freshman wide receiver returned to action Saturday after missing a few weeks, snatching four receptions for 74 yards and one touchdown. He added one unfortunate unsportsmanlike penalty for taunting a defender, but outside of the one rookie mistake, Davis Jr. looked the part of a top-tier ACC talent. \u201cHim just getting back out there was good for us,\u201d quarterback Brennan Armstrong said. \u201cHe needs to get back into it, I feel like. Missing three weeks is a long time, and I feel like once he did that, got him the touchdown today, I feel like he\u2019s ready to go for the rest of the season.\u201d With Davis Jr. in the lineup, the Cavaliers feel more confident in their ability to stretch the defenses vertically. \u201cIt keeps defenses, as they want to defend our run game, as they want to defend our quarterback, they just have to know there\u2019s a bigger risk than what they have,\u201d Mendenhall said. \u201cWith Lavel back, just the three or four receptions he had, they stand out. It makes defensive coordinators and defensive players more hesitant to get closer.\u201d Containing Cunningham UVa\u2019s defense played well for the most part Saturday, but it struggled in one area: slowing down Malik Cunningham. Louisville\u2019s quarterback carried the ball 20 times for 197 yards and two touchdowns. The rushing output was the best of Cunningham\u2019s career, and it\u2019s the most by an ACC quarterback all season. With star offensive weapons Javian Hawkins and Tutu Atwell out Saturday, the Cardinals leaned on Cunningham, and it nearly helped Louisville pull the upset. Virginia linebacker Zane Zandier summed the challenged up best. \u201cHe\u2019s very fast,\u201d Zandier said. Fortunately for UVa, the Cardinals\u2019 offense lacked consistent firepower with Atwell and Hawkins out. Even with Cunningham running wild, Louisville failed to reach 20 points. Injury updates The Cavaliers were unaffected by COVID-19 on Saturday. The team announced prior to Saturday\u2019s game that there were no players or coaches in isolation or quarantine due to the virus. Unfortunately for Virginia, injuries kept a few players out of the game. Joey Blount missed another game for the Wahoos. The safety hasn\u2019t played since UVa\u2019s 40-23 loss to Wake Forest on Oct. 17. Fellow safety Brenton Nelson also missed Saturday\u2019s contest. Offensive weapon Keytaon Thompson, who lines up all over the field for the Cavaliers, also missed Saturday\u2019s game against Louisville. During the game, wide receiver Tavares Kelly Jr, offensive lineman Dillon Reinkensmeyer and tight end Tony Poljan all exited the contest with various injuries. On the bright side, Indiana transfer running back Ronnie Walker Jr. made his Virginia debut Saturday. He carried the ball five times for 20 yards.","618":"Through two games this fall, Virginia football players and coaches believed they were trending in the right direction. The Cavaliers forced seven turnovers in a season-opening 18-point win over Duke before competing well against then-No. 1 Clemson. Then, the Wahoos performed horribly in a 38-21 loss to N.C. State. They followed the performance with losses to Wake Forest and Miami, dropping to 1-4 on the year. As the losses piled up, some fans checked the calendar to see when the men\u2019s basketball season would start. While doubts creeped in among fans, the players and coaches remained calm. They kept saying they believed they were close to victories and that development occurring in practice would soon show on game days. Finally, after weeks of disappointing results, the growth and results are showing. Virginia upset North Carolina 44-41 at the end of October, and it took down Louisville 31-17 on Saturday to improve to 3-4 this fall with a winnable contest against Abilene Christian next on the team\u2019s schedule. \u201cThe reality is, this year the development of the team is happening while we\u2019re keeping score,\u201d head coach Bronco Mendenhall said. \u201cIt\u2019s not happening during spring, it\u2019s not happening during summer, it\u2019s happening while we\u2019re playing.\u201d That development seemed clear against Louisville. UVa\u2019s defense allowed over 450 total yards, but the Wahoos also forced three critical turnovers. One of those turnovers was a Noah Taylor interception that was returned for a touchdown. Offensively, UVa rushed for 165 yards and two scores, with a handful of players making contributions on the ground. Quarterback Brennan Armstrong was among those who made key plays with his legs, rushing 15 times for 60 yards and a pair of touchdowns. Maybe most importantly for Armstrong, he limited turnovers. The signal caller tossed just one interception against the Cardinals. In Armstrong\u2019s first three career starts, he fired six interceptions. In his three subsequent starts, he only threw two interceptions. \u201cI think I\u2019m gonna get better at that,\u201d Armstrong said. \u201cJust don\u2019t force things. I think that\u2019s what happened today, just tried to force something that wasn\u2019t there, could\u2019ve just scrambled and found something else, picked something up with my feet.\u201d UVa\u2019s team is growing, and the schedule sets up well for the Wahoos. An FCS team visits Charlottesville next weekend, and the Cavaliers travel to Tallahassee to face Florida State the following week. The Seminoles sit at just 2-6 on the season, and five of their six losses have come by at least 15 points. As basketball season begins, the football team could increase its winning streak to four games as it surges above .500. \u201cWe honestly think we can win every game the rest of our season,\u201d Armstrong. \u201cIt\u2019s just how we prepare, how we want to attack each and every game, and it just comes down solely to us not hurting ourselves and taking care of the ball.\u201d For a program that rarely brings in four- and five-star recruits, development means everything. Developing players during a pandemic has proved to be challenging, especially without a spring practice season. The Cavaliers have done well to avoid COVID-19 \u2014 they weren\u2019t missing any players due to positive tests or contact tracing against Louisville \u2014 and they\u2019re starting to put together improved on-field results. \u201cI think the bottom line is that I\u2019m still learning, growing and developing protocols in the very best way to play football in a pandemic,\u201d Mendenhall said. \u201cTrying to get the exact right practice models, execution models and everything possible to help a team flourish under a pretty tight time frame and keep them all healthy.\u201d UVa started the fall season slowly, jumping out to a 1-4 start as consistency in all three phases lacked. Since the subpar start, the Cavaliers upset a ranked North Carolina team and beat Louisville by two touchdowns. There\u2019s growth in Charlottesville, and it stemmed from the players and coaches keeping faith after starting the year 1-4. \u201cWe just kept fighting, battling,\u201d receiver Billy Kemp IV said Saturday. \u201cYou can really say that\u2019s just the nature of this team.\u201d","619":"The University of Virginia athletics department administered 1,135 COVID-19 tests from Nov. 9-15, and none of the tests came back positive. These results come after the Cavaliers reported just one positive test from Nov. 2-8. Since the UVa athletic department began testing student-athletes and staff for COVID-19 on July 5, it has administered 11,935 tests. Of those tests, a total of 92 came back positive. Any student-athletes or staff members who test positive for the virus must self-isolate for 10 days. Any close contacts of people who test positive for COVID-19 must self-quarantine for 14 days. Recording no new positive tests last week is a good result for the athletic department, especially given the nationwide rise in positive COVID-19 results. The country has recorded at least 100,000 new recorded cases each day for nearly two weeks. One ACC football game was postponed last weekend, as both Pittsburgh and Georgia Tech dealt with issues related to COVID-19. Despite surges in COVID-19 across various parts of the country, UVa\u2019s student-athletes and staff have done well to follow health protocols and remain safe. The football team competed Saturday against Louisville without any players either infected with the virus or in quarantine due to contact tracing. As the winter sport season arrives, members of the athletic department hope for similar results. Both the men\u2019s and women\u2019s basketball teams begin play on Nov. 25. Fall sports such as volleyball, cross country, field hockey and women\u2019s soccer all completed their fall seasons in recent weeks, making it through their altered schedules amid the pandemic. The football team\u2019s Nov. 7 game against Louisville was postponed to last Saturday due to issues with COVID-19 in Louisville\u2019s program. The game was played this past weekend, with the Cavaliers winning 31-17. Men\u2019s soccer\u2019s fall season is nearly over as it competes in the ACC Tournament, and four games remain on the football team\u2019s fall schedule, as Bronco Mendenhall\u2019s team hopes to safely navigate its way through the rest of the fall slate.","620":"A 31-17 win over Louisville moves the Virginia football team (3-4, 3-4 ACC) to within one game of .500 despite starting the season 1-4. Bronco Mendenhall and the Wahoos host a 1-4 Abilene Christian team this weekend, entering the game as a massive favorite. A win would mark three consecutive victories for the Cavaliers. Mendenhall\u2019s group liked the way it played Saturday when it beat the Cardinals, and it\u2019s hoping to build off the quality showing this Saturday. \u201cI think it was a complementary football approach that helped us move forward through that game,\u201d Mendenhall said. \u201cAnxious now to take on the next opponent as we move down the stretch of the season.\u201d Saturday\u2019s contest gives UVa its first \u2013 and only \u2013 game this fall against a nonconference opponent. Abilene Christian, an FCS foe, sits at 1-4 on the season. The Wildcats last played on Nov. 7, falling to Angelo State 34-21. The Cavaliers make it a priority to stay focused each week, regardless of the opponent. \u201cThere\u2019s very little attention that we put on the next opponent,\u201d Mendenhall said. \u201cThe focus is only on us.\u201d That mindset should come in handy for the Wahoos this week. On paper, Virginia enters Saturday as a massive favorite. Betting odds list UVa at roughly a five-touchdown favorite Saturday against the Wildcats. The spread makes sense, given UVa\u2019s recent play and Abilene Christian\u2019s struggles this fall. Regardless of what outside experts believe, the Cavaliers enter this week of preparation attempting to stay focused on the game and what\u2019s needed to safely play Saturday. \u201cWe\u2019re both coming into the game with a challenge up front of COVID and then you have the challenge of scheme and playing hard and practicing hard during the week leading up to the game,\u201d tight end Grant Misch said. On paper, the challenge this week seems easier, but the Wahoos aren\u2019t looking over the Wildcats. If the Cavaliers remain focused and execute well Saturday, they\u2019ll see plenty of opportunities for success. Abilene Christian allows an average of 246.8 rushing yards per game, and it allowed over 400 yards rushing in its most recent performance. That\u2019s good news for a UVa squad still seeking its first 100-yard rusher this fall. Attendance decrease UVa cheerleaders made an appearance at Scott Stadium in Virginia\u2019s win over Louisville. It marked the first time they attended a game all fall. Unfortunately, the group\u2019s visits may be short-lived. Recent guidance from the Commonwealth of Virginia will limit attendance at sporting events to a maximum of 250 people. The change \u2013 the previous maximum attendance was 1,000 people \u2013 comes as COVID-19 cases spike across the country and in Virginia. It\u2019s unclear exactly how the change will impact who attends UVa home football games, but it\u2019s likely the cheerleaders and some family members or friends of players and coaches will not attend games the rest of this fall as UVa reduces its previously allowed capacity by 750 people. ACC honors Virginia linebacker Noah Taylor recorded five tackles in Saturday\u2019s win over Louisville. He also snagged an interception and returned it 85 yards for a touchdown. Taylor\u2019s standout performance earned him ACC Linebacker of the Week honors on Monday. The last time UVa played \u2013 a 44-41 win over North Carolina \u2013 Charles Snowden won ACC Linebacker of the Week for his four-sack performance against the Tar Heels. Wide receiver Lavel Davis Jr. also earned ACC honors, winning Rookie of the Week accolades. He reeled in four receptions for 74 yards and a touchdown in the victory over Louisville. It\u2019s the second time this fall Davis has earned the honor. Keytaon Thompson update One of UVa\u2019s most dynamic offensive weapons missed Saturday\u2019s game against Louisville. Keytaon Thompson, who the Cavaliers use at quarterback, running back and wide receiver, will be available against Abilene Christian. Mendenhall declined to give much detail on why Thompson missed Saturday\u2019s game, though. \u201cI expect him to be back and available,\u201d Mendenhall said. \u201cI won\u2019t comment further on why he was not available. That\u2019s a private matter between he and I, but we do expect him back and starting to practice with the team this evening.\u201d","621":"A former star turned NBA player was traded, while the current UVa team learned two more tip times for this season. In total, four men\u2019s basketball start times are official. News also dropped Monday morning about the location of the 2021 NCAA Tournament. Ty Jerome traded to Thunder Former UVa men\u2019s basketball standout Ty Jerome was included in a blockbuster NBA trade, according to reports from ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski and others. Jerome is among four Phoenix Suns players being traded to the Oklahoma City Thunder. In return for Jerome, Kelly Oubre, Ricky Rubio, Jalen Lecque and a 2022 first-round pick, the Suns receive Chris Paul and Abdel Nader. The Thunder appear to be entering an extended rebuilding period, although it\u2019s unclear how they view Jerome\u2019s long-term prospects with their organization. As a member of the Suns in 2019-20, Jerome played in 31 games and averaged 3.3 points and 1.4 assists per contest. Jerome hopes to build on his rookie season in the NBA in future months. He\u2019ll take the court as a member of a new organization in year No. 2. Four game times, networks set The first four games of the Virginia men\u2019s basketball season all have official game times and TV networks. UVa\u2019s season opens against Maine in Connecticut on Nov. 25. The game will tip off at 2 p.m. and will air on FloHoops. The second game of Virginia\u2019s season comes against Florida on Nov. 27. That game will air on ESPN. Interestingly, the Black Friday contest tips off at 11:30 a.m. After competing in \u201cBubbleville\u201d in Connecticut against Maine and Florida, Tony Bennett\u2019s team comes home to Charlottesville. The Cavaliers host Saint Francis at 4 p.m. on Dec. 1. On Dec. 4, Virginia hosts Kent State at 6 p.m. Both of UVa\u2019s first two home games are set to air on the ACC Network. NCAA Tournament changes The NCAA announced Monday that it plans on holding the NCAA men\u2019s basketball tournament in one single geographic location this spring, given the spread of COVID-19 and the risks associated with travel to various destinations. Currently, the NCAA is in talks with Indiana state officials to hold the tournament in the Indianapolis area. Indianapolis was already scheduled to host this year\u2019s Final Four. \u201cWe have learned so much from monitoring other successful sporting events in the last several months, and it became clear it\u2019s not feasible to manage this complex championship in so many different states with the challenges presented by the pandemic,\u201d Dan Gavitt, NCAA Senior Vice President of Basketball, said. \u201cHowever, we are developing a solid plan to present a safe, responsible and fantastic March Madness tournament unlike any other we\u2019ve experienced.\u201d The UVa men\u2019s basketball team enters the season as a national title contender. The Cavaliers sit at No. 4 in the AP top 25 preseason poll, and the Cavaliers boast a lineup with experience and depth. Kihei Clark returns at point guard, while Marquette transfer Sam Hauser steps in on the wing and Jay Huff slides into a starting center role. The talented group could play all its NCAA Tournament games in one state this spring. NBA Draft set for Wednesday The 2020 virtual NBA Draft takes place Wednesday, starting at 7 p.m. UVa\u2019s top prospect in the draft is Mamadi Diakite, who projects as a potential second-round pick. Unlike the NFL Draft, the NBA Draft lasts just two rounds. There\u2019s a chance no UVa players are drafted in this year\u2019s draft, depending on Diakite\u2019s fate. Diakite started all 30 games for UVa last season, averaging 13.7 points and 6.8 rebounds per game. He also blocked 1.3 shots per contest. Diakite\u2019s biggest asset is his defensive prowess, as he showed the ability to guard both small forwards and power forwards while at UVa. He rebounds well and blocks shots effectively without fouling. While at Virginia, Diakite\u2019s jump shot also improved tremendously. He knocked down 35.7% of his 3-point shots a season ago. He\u2019s still a work-in-progress on the offensive end, but his versatility and size make him a player teams may target toward the end of the second round of the draft.","622":"Family and football mean everything to Ronnie Walker Jr. When his on-field talent took him to Bloomington, Indiana, to play in the Big Ten, he knew it brought him away from his home in Hopewell, Virginia. As the pandemic hit, Walker felt the need to return closer to home. The talented running back made the decision this offseason to transfer from Indiana to UVa to be about an hour from his mom and grandmother during the pandemic. \u201cThat\u2019s the No. 1 reason why I came home,\u201d Walker said. \u201cMy grandma\u2019s sick. I\u2019m just going back home and helping my grandma out and my mom.\u201d Walker\u2019s grandmother can\u2019t do certain tasks, so UVa\u2019s new backfield weapon drives down to help out when he\u2019s not busy with class or practice. He goes grocery shopping for his grandmother weekly, and he helps with any chores in the yard that she can\u2019t handle. He also hoped the NCAA would grant him a waiver to play immediately for the Wahoos this fall, but the waiver process proved tiresome, perplexing and frustrating. His first waiver application was denied. His first appeal also was denied. Head coach Bronco Mendenhall spoke with the media throughout the process, seeming unclear exactly what kept leading to the NCAA rejecting appeals. UVa then sent in an additional appeal, and it took the NCAA weeks to respond to Virginia\u2019s final effort. \u201cIt seems like our urgency is more than maybe that of who we\u2019re working with,\u201d Mendenhall said as the Cavaliers navigated the waiver process on Oct. 5. Finally, and perhaps mercifully, the NCAA put an end to the delays and approved the running back\u2019s waiver on Oct. 14. \u201cIt was a long process, but we persevered and got through it,\u201d Walker said. Unfortunately, Walker fell ill within days of learning his waiver was approved. He told his family the news of the approved waiver and they celebrated his future game day appearances this fall, but his on-field debut hit another roadblock as he started feeling under the weather. He says he developed flu-like symptoms the week of the Wake Forest game. While he says the illness wasn\u2019t COVID-19, the sickness kept him off the field against Wake Forest, Miami and UNC. He became available last weekend against Louisville. His long journey to the field ended when he took a carry against the Cardinals in the second quarter. Walker\u2019s first carry went for 11 yards, taking the Cavaliers down to Louisville\u2019s 21. The Wahoos scored a touchdown three plays later. In his first game at UVa, Walker carried the ball five times for 20 yards. \u201cToday was just the next step in a bigger role for him, and he handled the role and the touches that he got really well,\u201d Mendenhall said. Virginia\u2019s head coach expects Walker to play a bigger part in the offense as the season progresses and the running back\u2019s fitness improves. Mendenhall says the transfer is still working up to game shape and speed. The journey to the field took longer than Walker expected, and it\u2019s reasonable to question the fairness of the waiver process that kept him off the field for weeks. Even with the frustrating process and the delayed return to the field, Walker doesn\u2019t hold any bitter feelings about the situation. He doesn\u2019t seem bothered by Indiana\u2019s on-field success either. He left a team currently in the AP top 10 to join UVa, which sits a game below .500 this fall, but he likes his UVa teammates and being a part of the team in Charlottesville. Doubts don\u2019t cross Walker\u2019s mind. He made the best decision for him and his family. Watching Indiana succeed only makes him happy for his former teammates. \u201cBrotherhood through football lasts a lifetime,\u201d Walker said. It\u2019s been a challenging few months for Walker. But his mom\u2019s reaction to his Virginia debut made the weeks of waiting all worth it. \u201cShe was very excited,\u201d Walker said. \u201cI\u2019ve seen a video of her screaming at the top of her lungs. You could hear the emotion through her voice. I felt some type of way when I heard that.\u201d","623":"The ACC\u2019s 15 football teams authored a perfect October. Each of the 34 scheduled games was played, on time and with nary a hitch. Bigger picture: From the season\u2019s mid-September kickoff through last weekend, only six matchups had to be reshuffled because COVID-19 had compromised one of the teams. Meanwhile, 65 contests were staged, and every conference program remained on track to complete its targeted 11-game regular season. \u201cIt\u2019s just really remarkable,\u201d Virginia Tech coach Justin Fuente said Monday morning. \u201cAn amazing accomplishment,\u201d Virginia coach Bronco Mendenhall said about an hour later. Then, at 5:48 p.m. Monday, an email from league HQ: A virus outbreak within Miami\u2019s program has prompted the rescheduling of six games, three involving the Hurricanes. Yet no matter how inconvenient \u2014 Louisville, North Carolina, Georgia Tech, Wake Forest, Boston College and the Southern Conference\u2019s Western Carolina also are affected \u2014 Monday\u2019s news does not blemish all college football has managed to date, especially the ACC. Look at the world around us. The late-fall\/winter wave of infections that medical experts projected has arrived, and last weekend 15 Bowl Subdivision games were canceled or postponed, including Pitt at Georgia Tech in the ACC, delayed until Dec. 12 because of virus issues in both camps. Among the Power Five conferences, the ACC\u2019s 11-game regular season is the most ambitious, the model adopted to provide ESPN with its contracted inventory. Calculated, yes, but by starting the second week of September, the league created the wiggle room that enabled Monday\u2019s circus-level juggling of six games. \u201cI think starting earlier has been beneficial,\u201d Fuente said. \u201cIt\u2019s given us a little more flexibility in the schedule. I don\u2019t know how it\u2019s going to play out with the Big Ten and the Pac-12 with the delayed start. They\u2019re going to be in a little bit of a time crunch here.\u201d A bit? Just consider the Pac-12\u2019s machinations last Friday. When infections at Utah and Arizona State forced the cancellation of their respective Saturday games against UCLA and Cal, the conference paired UCLA against Cal on Sunday \u2014 at 9 a.m., Pacific time, on less than 48 hours\u2019 notice. How the remainder of the regular season transpires is anyone\u2019s guess. So, too, the postseason. With most campuses concluding the fall semester this month, teams in all sports will be, in theory, better able to isolate from the general population and mitigate infection risk. Moreover, even with Monday\u2019s announcement, all 15 ACC teams remain able, as of this moment, to complete their full regular seasons, a testament to the athletes. \u201cI do think we are doing some good things, in terms of teaching young people to persevere,\u201d Fuente said. \u201cThe message I keep giving is that if you can do this, when we come out on the other end, when you as an individual come out on the other end, you are going to be that much better for it. You are going to be able to say that you handled all of this adversity, so the next hard thing that happens in your life, you are going to have the confidence to know you can overcome it. \u201cI do think that sometimes we lose a little bit of that in society, the struggle and the satisfaction that comes with battling with adverse circumstances.\u201d But even if the regular season can be, to some degree, finished, how many teams beyond the four selected for the College Football Playoff will want to prolong grueling COVID protocols for additional weeks just to compete in a bowl? How many players will just want to go home to family? Driving tourism and showcasing local charms, bowls are community assets, not to mention popular holiday programming for ESPN. But in a pandemic, most, if not all, the events surrounding bowls will vanish. Two of the ACC\u2019s contracted postseason destinations, the San Diego-based Holiday Bowl and the new Boston-based Fenway Bowl, already have canceled for this season. Another, the Sun Bowl in El Paso, Texas, is imperiled by a virus spike there. In a normal year, Virginia\u2019s 3-4 record would make its bowl eligibility uncertain. But for this pandemic season, the NCAA ditched the six-win minimum, making all teams eligible. The Cavaliers have earned postseason invitations in each of the last three years, and a fourth straight would equal the program record. But Mendenhall has doubts about the postseason. \u201cHow many bowl games will there be?\u201d he said. \u201cAnd what are the financial components to that, which we know is at the heart of the season anyway, and the television part and how much sense that makes. So there [are] a lot of different variables.\u201d Virginia Tech (4-4) revels in its 27-year run of bowl appearances, the nation\u2019s longest active streak. But Fuente is not sure how he and his players might view a postseason opportunity. \u201cI don\u2019t know how everybody\u2019s going to feel,\u201d he said. \u201cI do know that football games are precious and opportunities are precious. There\u2019s not another sport where you work as hard in the offseason and train as much for as few opportunities to actually get to play the game. \u201cSo by and large, our kids have welcomed the opportunity to get to play games. But I do understand. It has weighed heavily on everyone as we\u2019ve been through the season. I\u2019ve been as candid about that as maybe anything else that we\u2019ve talked about. It has been a daily mental and emotional grind for everyone, particularly the players.\u201d Grind notwithstanding, Hokies junior linebacker Dax Hollifield is all in for postseason. \u201cI\u2019ve been dealing with protocols for the past three or four months,\u201d he said Tuesday. \u201cThey\u2019re normal now. I would love to play in a bowl. That\u2019s really my main goal right now. ... \u201cLast year losing to UVa and losing the [Commonwealth] Cup [after 15 consecutive wins in the series], that hurt really, really bad. I don\u2019t really want to lose any more streaks. We have something special here, and that\u2019s the bowl streak. No other team in the country has that. So that\u2019s ours. We\u2019ve got to keep that.\u201d","624":"For the first time in a long time, Virginia passes Virginia Tech in the ACC power poll. The Hokies keep losing heartbreakers, while the Wahoos gain momentum weekly. Elsewhere, Notre Dame holds onto the No. 1 spot in the poll, while Miami quietly lurks at No. 3. If the Hurricanes can win out, a few upsets at the top of the standings could boost them into the ACC title game. At the bottom of the poll, Syracuse remains the ACC\u2019s worst squad this fall. 1. Notre Dame (8-0, 7-0 ACC, No. 1 last week): The Fighting Irish beat a solid Boston College squad 45-31 the week after an emotional victory over Clemson. Ian Book threw for 283 yards and three touchdowns, and the Irish ran the ball 49 times for 274 yards and three scores. The win against the Eagles keeps Notre Dame firmly in the No. 1 spot of our power poll. Up next: Bye 2. Clemson (7-1, 6-1 ACC, No. 2 last week): The Tigers, who didn\u2019t play last week, return to action this weekend with a winnable contest against Florida State. Trevor Lawrence returns to the field after recovering from COVID-19, which should offer an emotional lift to a team fighting to set up a potential rematch with Notre Dame in the conference championship. Up next: at Florida State, Saturday, noon 3. Miami (7-1, 6-1 ACC, No. 3 last week): D\u2019Eriq King and the Hurricanes fell behind at Virginia Tech, but rallied late for a 25-24 victory over the Hokies. Miami is 3-0 in its last three games, winning each game by just one possession. The Hurricanes are lurking in the ACC standings and may sneak into the conference title game if they can win out. Unfortunately, they won\u2019t play for two weeks due to COVID-19 issues. Up next: Bye 4. North Carolina (6-2, 6-2 ACC, No. 4 last week): Despite another poor defensive showing, North Carolina picked up a victory, edging Wake Forest 59-53 in a shootout between two of the ACC\u2019s best quarterbacks. Wake's Sam Hartman tossed for 429 yards and four touchdowns, adding a fifth touchdown with his legs. UNC\u2019s Sam Howell won the quarterback duel against Hartman, throwing for 550 yards and six touchdowns to go with a rushing touchdown of his own. Up next: Bye 5. N.C. State (5-3, 5-3 ACC, No. 5 last week): Bailey Hockman keeps playing well in Devin Leary\u2019s absence at quarterback. He completed 24 of his 34 passes for 265 yards and three touchdowns in Saturday\u2019s 38-22 win over Florida State. Hockman threw one interception, but also added a touchdown on the ground in a solid performance. Up next: vs. Liberty, Saturday, 7:30 p.m. 6. Wake Forest (4-3, 3-3 ACC, No. 6 last week): Midway through the third quarter, Wake Forest led North Carolina 45-24. The Tar Heels proceeded to score the next 35 points to take a 59-45 lead. The Demon Deacons answered late with a touchdown and two-point conversion, but the defense let them down in the 59-53 loss. They won\u2019t play this Saturday due to COVID-19 issues. Next: Bye 7. Boston College (5-4, 4-4 ACC, No. 7 last week): The Eagles lost to an elite Notre Dame team 45-31, but they were competitive for stretches in the loss. An inability to slow Notre Dame\u2019s offense led to the two-possession defeat, but Boston College has shown flashes of being a top-tier ACC team this fall. Up next: Bye 8. Virginia (3-4, 3-4 ACC, No. 9 last week): After a 1-4 start to the season, the Cavaliers sit a game away from returning to .500. UVa beat Louisville 31-17 by forcing three turnovers and making enough plays offensively to outlast a shorthanded Cardinals squad missing two of its best offensive weapons. A game against Abilene Christian on Saturday gives the Wahoos a great opportunity to improve to 4-4. A week later, the Cavaliers face a struggling Florida State squad. Up next: vs. Abilene Christian, Saturday, 4 p.m. 9. Virginia Tech (4-4, 4-3 ACC, No. 8 last week): While Miami keeps pulling out close wins, the Hokies keep losing tight games. Virginia Tech\u2019s point differential in its past four contests is -4, but it is just 1-3 in those four close games. The Hokies fell to Miami 25-24 a week after losing to Liberty 38-35 on a last-second field goal. Up next: at Pittsburgh, Saturday, 4 p.m. 10. Pittsburgh (4-4, 3-4 ACC, No. 10 last week): COVID-19 kept the Panthers out of action Saturday. They were supposed to face Georgia Tech, but instead they received a week off. Pitt hopes to return to action this weekend. Up next: vs. Virginia Tech, Saturday, 4 p.m. 11. Georgia Tech (2-5, 2-4 ACC, No. 11 last week): The Yellow Jackets didn\u2019t play last weekend as they dealt with COVID-19 issues and so did their opponent, Pittsburgh. Georgia Tech is off again this week after its scheduled game with Miami was postponed due to COVID-19 issues affecting the Hurricanes. Up next: Bye 12. Louisville (2-6, 1-6 ACC, No. 12 last week): Running back Javian Hawkins opted out of the rest of the season to prepare for the NFL Draft. Wide receiver Tutu Atwell missed Saturday\u2019s game against UVa. That left Malik Cunningham to rush for nearly 200 yards, but he needed more help in the Cardinals\u2019 31-17 loss. It\u2019s been a tough fall for Louisville. Up next: vs. Syracuse, Friday, 7 p.m. 13. Florida State (2-6, 1-6 ACC, No. 13 last week): It\u2019s shocking that Florida State somehow took down North Carolina in mid-October. Since the upset, the Seminoles are 0-3 with three double-digit losses. The latest blowout loss came against N.C. State, with Florida State losing 38-22. Expect another blowout loss this weekend. Up next: vs. Clemson, Saturday, noon 14. Duke (2-6, 1-6 ACC, No. 14 last week): The Blue Devils enjoyed a week off, and they were scheduled to return to the field against a Wake Forest team playing well. COVID-19 had other plans. Up next: Bye 15. Syracuse (1-7, 1-6 ACC, No. 15 last week): Syracuse returns to the field this Friday against a 2-6 Louisville team, and the Orange are still nearly three-touchdown underdogs. Up next: at Louisville, Friday, 7 p.m.","625":"Clemson scored the go-ahead goal a penalty kick with a little more than three minutes remaining in regulation and held on for a 2-1 win over the Cavaliers in the ACC semifinals in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. Virginia finishes its fall schedule with a record of 3-4-1. With the game tied at 1-1, a foul was called on Virginia\u2019s Jeremy Verley for his defense of Kimarni Smith in the box. Clemson\u2019s Luis Felipe Fernandez-Salvador was called on to take the penalty kick attempt, which he converted to give Clemson a 2-1 lead. Smith gave Clemson an early 1-0 lead with a goal in the 23rd minute. The Tigers held that lead for more than 60 minutes until Virginia\u2019s Axel Gunnarsson scored the equalizer in the 85th minute. The sophomore striker scored his second goal of the season when he turned and fired a shot from tough angle near the top of the six that deflected off a Tiger defender and went over the head of the goalkeeper. The Cavaliers\u2019 euphoria was short lived, however. Just two minutes later, Fernandez-Salvador converted the penalty kick to give the Tigers the lead for good. \u201cI felt like we stayed in [our system], Clemson is a good team,\u201d Virginia coach George Gelnovatch said. \u201cAs the game went on, we were able to string some more passes together and get after them a little bit more. I felt that would lead to some chances in the second half strictly due to the fact that they expended some energy defending us in the first part of the game and ultimately it did. Overall I thought we managed the game well.\u201d The late frenzy continued a trend of exciting finishes for the Cavaliers this fall. Virginia has scored four goals after the 76th minute, including a 90th minute score by Nick Berghold against Pittsburgh on Oct. 18. On the flip side, the Cavaliers have surrendered four goals after the 86th minute, including two golden goals in extra time. UVa goalkeeper Colin Shutler made six saves on the 13 Clemson shots he faced. Shutler now has 129 career saves, moving him into 10th place all-time on Virginia\u2019s career saves list. Despite the tough end to the fall campaign, Gelnovatch felt his team made progress during a difficult season while navigating the COVID-19 pandemic. \u201cThere are a lot of positives to take from this fall segment,\u201d said Gelnovatch. \u201cFrom the beginning of year, I think we made a lot of progress that will help us prepare for the spring championship segment.\u201d","626":"The Hokies will have to win in Pittsburgh, where Heinz Field hasn\u2019t been kind to them. Meanwhile, UVA is a massive favorite at home over FCS Abilene Christian. And the No. 21 Flames, the only ranked team of this group, look to go 3-0 against ACC opponents when they visit North Carolina State. This season, I\u2019m joined each week by Richmond Times-Dispatch columnist David Teel, Roanoke Times Columnist Aaron McFarling and Charlottesville Daily Progress Virginia beat writer Bennett Conlin. We\u2019ll pick games involving Virginia Tech and UVA, along with one other key ACC matchup. Then, to create a little more separation in the standings, we\u2019ll each predict an upset against the spread from anywhere on the FBS board. The group had a big bounce back last week, 13-3, paced by McFarling\u2019s perfect 4-0 week. Here are this week\u2019s picks:  Virginia Tech at Pittsburgh, 4 p.m., Heinz Field: Aaron McFarling, Roanoke Times (20-10): The Hokies are 0-6 against the spread in the past six meetings at Heinz Field, 2-10 ATS in their past 12 meetings with Pitt, 1-5 ATS in their past six road games overall. In what universe does Tech -3 feel like a safe wager in this spot? THE PICK: Pittsburgh 30, Virginia Tech 25 Bennett Conlin, Charlottesville Daily Progress (20-11): The Hokies followed a heartbreaking three-point loss to Liberty with a one-point loss to Miami. Pitt can relate, losing consecutive games by one point earlier this fall. Look for the Virginia Tech to bounce back from devastating losses by dishing out heartbreak of its own. THE PICK: Virginia Tech 28, Pittsburgh 27 Mike Barber, Richmond Times-Dispatch (19-12): Virginia Tech has solidified things defensively by reverting to more of the Bud Foster scheme. Running back Khalil Herbert continues to work his way back from a hamstring issue. That\u2019s the good news. The bad news is, the Panthers are built to stop the run and Heinz Field has been a house of horrors for the Hokies, who are 1-5 in their last six trips to Pitt. That includes a 52-22 stomping two years ago. Of course, the Panthers are still battling a COVID outbreak, 2020\u2019s ultimate wild card. THE PICK: Pittsburgh 27, Virginia Tech 24 David Teel, Richmond Times-Dispatch (16-15): The Hokies lead the ACC in rushing offense at 6.1 yards per carry. The Panthers lead the nation in rushing defense (2.2 yards per carry). So the formula for Tech becomes grind out just enough yards on the ground and exploit Pitt's press coverage on the perimeter. The wild card is the state of the Panthers' roster after last week's COVID outbreak. THE PICK: Virginia Tech 24, Pittsburgh 20  Abilene Christian at Virginia, 4 p.m., Scott Stadium: McFarling: Anything but a name-the-score result here for the Cavaliers is a disappointment. Let\u2019s not waste any time breaking down this COVID-tastic matchup. THE PICK: Virginia 60, Abilene Christian 9 Conlin: Angelo State rushed for over 400 yards against Abilene Christian in the Wildcats' most recent game. UVA's backfield, which features three capable running backs with the recent addition of Ronnie Walker Jr., should be salivating at the chance to run wild Saturday. This isn't the UVA fans saw in 2016, so the Cavaliers don't have to worry about beating an FCS opponent. THE PICK: Virginia 55, Abilene Christian 10 Barber: The ACC wanted Virginia to find an opponent for its plus-1. This is who UVA found. The Cavaliers should be able to get their run game going in this one and build momentum for a stretch run in the league that includes Florida State, Boston College and Virginia Tech. The big thing in this one? Staying healthy. THE PICK: Virginia 45, Abilene Christian 6 Teel: No injuries, no drama. That's the mission for the Cavaliers against the Wildcats, the most far-flung FCS opponent UVA has ever scheduled (welcome to 2020). THE PICK: Virginia 45, Abilene Christian 10.  Liberty at North Carolina State, 7:30 p.m., Carter-Finley Stadium: McFarling: Fun fact: Not only has Liberty covered the spread in its past five games, but the Flames have blanketed the number by a whopping 63.5 points over that span. Vegas is still catching up to these guys, which is understandable. Meantime, take the 3.5 points. THE PICK: Liberty 35, North Carolina State 30 Conlin: The undefeated Flames sit at a perfect 2-0 against ACC teams this fall, beating Syracuse and Virginia Tech. A win over the Wolfpack adds to Liberty's impressive resume. Unfortunately for the Flames, they've listened all week as people speculate about head coach Hugh Freeze leaving for South Carolina. That added distraction coupled with quality play from N.C. State quarterback Bailey Hockman leads to Liberty's first defeat of the fall. THE PICK: North Carolina State 38, Liberty 27 Barber: So, maybe I\u2019m just too slow to come around on the Flames. But even with a pair of ACC wins under their belt (Syracuse and Virginia Tech), I\u2019m still not sold. Of course, the Wolfpack have been all over the board this season as well, in large part because of its quarterback issues. Still, going into this year, I would have predicted Liberty to be 0-3 against ACC teams. I can\u2019t imagine it, instead, going 3-0. THE PICK: North Carolina State 38, Liberty 35 Teel: The Flames beat Virginia Tech by three. The Wolfpack lost to Tech by 21. So by the transitive property, unbeaten and 21st-ranked Liberty wins by 24. OK, probably not. But Malik Willis and friends will be a handful for their third ACC opponent of the season. THE PICK: North Carolina State 24, Liberty 23. Upset of the week McFarling: This isn\u2019t the year you that can just count on blue blood teams bouncing back when they absolutely have to (see: Wolverines, Michigan). The Razerbacks, who are getting 2.5 points at home here, are 6-1 against the spread this season and 10-3 ATS in the past 13 meetings with LSU. THE PICK: Arkansas 33, LSU 28 Conlin: One of the best games of the weekend features Appalachian State playing at Coastal Carolina. The two squads are fairly even, but the expectations sit heavier for the undefeated and ranked Chanticleers. I'll take the road underdogs in an exciting matchup. THE PICK: Appalachian State 24, Coastal Carolina 21 Barber: I\u2019m leaving the Big Ten, even though I toyed with Minnesota and Penn State as home underdogs this week. I\u2019m heading west. The Mountain West treated me well earlier this year, so I\u2019m taking Nevada to pull the slight upset over San Diego State. The Wolfpack\u2019s offense will get the better of the Aztecs\u2019 stout defense in this one. THE PICK: Nevada 28, San Diego State 27 Teel: Army was my upset pick last week and lost by 26 to Tulane. So I'm a bit salty with the Black Knights, who are 4-point favorites over Georgia Southern this week. Give me the Eagles against their former coach Jeff Monken. THE PICK: Georgia Southern 30, Army 27","627":"When the Virginia football team takes the field Saturday against Abilene Christian, it will be in front of just 250 fans. Recent guidance from the Governor\u2019s office reduced the previously reduced capacity even more. Collegiate sporting events in Virginia can host a maximum of 250 spectators. Earlier this fall 1,000 fans were allowed at games. The new restrictions come as COVID-19 case counts rise in Virginia and across the country. The pandemic and subsequent positive tests within athletic departments led to ACC football games scheduled for Nov. 7, 14, 21 and 28 being postponed. Virginia\u2019s Nov. 7 game with Louisville was pushed to Nov. 14 due to COVID-19 issues within Louisville\u2019s program, while Pittsburgh and Georgia Tech postponed their Nov. 14 meeting. Miami will miss games on Nov. 21 and 28 due to positive COVID-19 tests within its program. Wake Forest and Duke won\u2019t play this weekend either because the Demon Deacons are struggling with positive tests. As the pandemic worsens, college sports aren\u2019t immune to the impact affecting people across the country. UVa\u2019s athletic department remains mostly healthy, though, posting impressive testing results while other programs fail to do the same. The athletic department reported zero positive tests from 1,135 tests administered from Nov. 9-15. Zero UVa football players missed Saturday\u2019s win over Louisville due to either a positive test or contact tracing requirements. \u201cTo this point, if a game isn\u2019t to be played it\u2019s not because of us,\u201d head coach Bronco Mendenhall said Monday. \u201cOur numbers are very low. Our protocols are really strong, and our team is safe. And they have been up to now, from the very, very beginning, and that had to be in place morally for me to even make sense of attempting what we\u2019re doing.\u201d Mendenhall wakes up each morning with the No. 1 priority being to keep his team safe. Then, he shifts focus toward his team\u2019s on-field performance. \u201cThat has been and started as the primary focus and the very intent and what I promised the parents we would do,\u201d Mendenhall said. \u201cI would do everything I could do.\u201d The results are promising. While the Cavaliers reported some positive tests over the course of the fall season, the volume of positive tests and players who missed time with contact tracing stayed low. As teams across the country struggle to keep the virus from spreading throughout their program, the Cavaliers remain focused on diligently following the health protocols necessary to avoid the virus. \u201cI don\u2019t see it being a lot harder,\u201d senior defensive lineman Mandy Alonso said of this season\u2019s additional protocols. \u201cYou have to add more time into the preparation of getting all these tests done and just being conscious about masking and social distancing, but really I don\u2019t think it\u2019s as big of a deal as a lot of people make it out to be.\u201d Alonso feels the team adjusted quickly to the new protocols, and the changes feel normal. UVa football players returned to Charlottesville on July 5, so they\u2019ve followed COVID-19 health protocols in a team setting for several months. Mendenhall loves his team\u2019s commitment to the protocols, and he\u2019s pleasantly surprised the ACC enters late November with a chance to finish the conference season, even with a few schedule changes and more potentially on the way. \u201cI\u2019m encouraged of what the commitment level of young people shows,\u201d Mendenhall said. \u201cI had a long talk with [Louisville head coach] Scott Satterfield before the game and we\u2019ve never seen anything like it and it\u2019s just refreshing to be able to talk to someone else in the same seat. [Miami head coach] Manny Diaz has been a little bit more outspoken in terms of how it\u2019s game day every day, but the uncertainty swirls around each and every week. But really the commitment to the protocols is real. It\u2019s exhausting and it takes more discipline.\u201d The discipline leaves the Cavaliers in position to finish their fall season. Four games remain on the schedule with two of the games at home and road trips to Florida State and Virginia Tech left on the schedule. That means three of UVa\u2019s final four games occur in Virginia and require little or no travel. There\u2019s a light at the end of the tunnel for the Wahoos. At the same time, a reduced capacity in Scott Stadium this weekend serves as a reminder that UVa\u2019s promising test results could change at any moment. As case counts rise across Virginia and more people become infected with the virus, the risk of potential exposure grows. The pandemic is still a very real and credible threat. Reaching the end of the season \u2014 regardless of on-field results \u2014 represents perhaps the largest challenge facing college football teams the next month. \u201cWe just kind of seem to be chugging along without much drama,\u201d Mendenhall said. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean that I\u2019m underestimating or saying that this week it couldn\u2019t be different for us. It\u2019s hard every day to keep our team safe, to keep our team healthy and to move forward. So every week is a challenge, every day, quite frankly, we\u2019re at risk.\u201d","628":"The Virginia football team returned home from Miami last month with a 1-4 record. With the Cavaliers hosting a ranked North Carolina team the following week, their record dipping to a 1-5 seemed likely. Bronco Mendenhall\u2019s team insisted it was better than its record indicated leading up to the UNC game. Despite four consecutive losses, the Wahoos believed they were capable of competing with foes at the top of the ACC. With their losing streak growing, the Cavaliers\u2019 offense caught fire in a 44-41 upset victory over North Carolina on Oct. 31. Brennan Armstrong played well, and the Cavaliers took down Sam Howell and the Tar Heels. After COVID-19 issues within Louisville\u2019s program delayed the game against the Cardinals by a week, the Wahoos picked up their third win of the year on Nov. 14. Virginia (3-4, 3-4 ACC) won 31-17, beating a shorthanded Louisville squad. This week, Virginia welcomes Abilene Christian to Scott Stadium. The Cavaliers enter the game as heavy favorites, and a win over the outmatched FCS squad would bring UVa back to .500 on the season while stretching its winning streak to three games. \u201cIt\u2019ll be a huge milestone, because losing four games in a row was pretty rough for everyone,\u201d tight end Grant Misch said. \u201cWe never wanted to lose faith. Every week, coach would come up and tell us, \u2018Guys, you aren\u2019t a bad team, we just gotta put everything together to win these games.\u2019 I think we\u2019re starting to see that.\u201d Putting everything together essentially boils down to performing more consistently in all three phases. In the opening weeks of the season, the Cavaliers struggled with turnovers and inconsistent play. The defense allowed too many game-changing big plays, and the special teams unit made costly errors. Recent performances from the Wahoos show growth in all three phases. The special teams unit blocked a field goal against Miami and used a fake punt to seal the victory over the Tar Heels. The Cavaliers also limited turnovers against Miami, UNC and Louisville. Virginia is 3-0 this year when winning the turnover battle and 0-4 when losing it. Part of the improved success in limiting turnovers also stems from a healthy Armstrong at quarterback. The Louisville game marked the first time all season that Armstrong played the majority of three consecutive games. He missed the second half of the loss to N.C. State and missed the entire Wake Forest loss. With Armstrong healthy, he\u2019s grown into his starting role. In his first three career starts, Armstrong threw six interceptions. He\u2019s thrown two interceptions over his three latest starts. \u201cRather than making it bigger and broader, and other influences that I think are present, it\u2019s having Brennan back-to-back-to-back,\u201d Mendenhall said of the team\u2019s improved play the last couple weeks. \u201cJust having our quarterback available to play football. I believe the season started strong with Duke and a good performance versus Clemson. Then there were two games where we didn\u2019t have him and did the best we could to innovate and develop and move our team forward.\u201d With Armstrong back, the Cavaliers lost on the road to a top-tier Miami team by just five points. They fell 19-14, squandering legitimate chances to upset the Hurricanes. The next week, Virginia upset North Carolina. Last week, Virginia beat Louisville. The Cavaliers are 3-3 in games started by Armstrong, with two of the three losses coming to nationally ranked Clemson and Miami. They\u2019re a respectable team with their starting quarterback active. \u201cEven though there are plenty of other factors, if you were just to say the biggest difference so we\u2019re not making it more or less than it is, having our quarterback back and healthy and putting some consistent practice reps in games together is pretty simple, but probably the most impactful answer,\u201d Mendenhall said. After starting 1-4 this fall, the Cavaliers sit at 3-4 on the year. Virginia faces a low-performing FCS squad this weekend before traveling to Tallahassee for a matchup with a struggling Florida State squad. Virginia\u2019s players and coaches kept saying they were better than their record showed when they sat at 1-4 on the year. Finally, Virginia\u2019s record is starting to reflect the team\u2019s talent and experience. \u201cWith each win, it\u2019s a great feeling just going in the locker room and celebrating with everyone,\u201d Misch said. \u201cTo be able to do it twice in a row is a great thing, especially at Scott Stadium because we always love to say that we don\u2019t lose at Scott. This week coming up there\u2019s another game at Scott Stadium, so hopefully another chance for us to go in there and celebrate after the game.\u201d","629":"Joe Harris stayed put in Brooklyn with a lucrative new deal, while Anthony Gill moved one step closer to fulfilling his NBA dreams. In Charlottesville, UVa announced the option for men\u2019s and women\u2019s basketball fans to buy cutouts for home basketball games, given attendance limitations stemming from COVID-19. Harris re-signs with Nets Former UVa star Joe Harris is staying in Brooklyn. The talented shooter agreed a four-year deal worth $75 million to return to the Nets, ESPN reported on Friday night. Brooklyn is expected to be a contender in the Eastern Conference this season, with Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving healthy. Durant and Irving are among the most talented players in the NBA, and Harris will be one of the players tasked with making contributions alongside the team\u2019s two superstars. Harris won\u2019t be the focal point of Brooklyn\u2019s system, but he\u2019ll be a valued part of the rotation as the Nets chase a championship. Harris posted arguably the best season of his NBA career in 2019-20, averaging a career-high 14.5 points and 4.3 rebounds per game. He shot 42.4% from beyond the 3-point line, while also making 55.3% of his 2-point shot attempts. Efficiency on the offensive end makes Harris a player capable of earning nearly $20 million per season for the next four years. Continued development also makes Harris a valuable NBA asset. In his first two NBA seasons, Harris played 56 games and averaged fewer than 10 minutes per game. He arrived in Brooklyn for the 2016-17 season and has increased his time on the floor in each season while also increasing his points per game total each year. Harris also developed his 3-point touch, which was good during his UVa days. He went from a quality shooter to one of the NBA\u2019s best, making at least 40% of his 3-pointers in each of the last three years. Gill joining Wizards Harris wasn\u2019t the only former UVa standout to land an NBA deal Friday night. ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski also reported that the Anthony Gill agreed to a two-year contract with the Washington Wizards. Gill, who has never played in an NBA regular season game, played with Khimki in the EuroLeague last season. He\u2019s spent the past three years in the EuroLeague, averaging 10.5 points and 4.3 rebounds over that span. Much like Harris, Gill offers efficiency as a shooter. He shot 44% from beyond the arc on 50 attempts last season, and he\u2019s a 40.6% 3-point shooter over the past three seasons. The 28-year-old forward possesses professional experience, and he\u2019s hoping his game translates to the NBA level as he aims to carve out a role with Washington. Fan cutouts COVID-19 protocols mean drastically limited attendance at collegiate sporting events. John Paul Jones Arena won\u2019t be packed with thousands of fans as the Virginia men\u2019s and women\u2019s basketball teams compete against ACC foes this winter. With in-person attendance limited, Virginia\u2019s athletic department is offering the chance for fans to buy cutouts of themselves that will be displayed at home games. Cutouts cost $75, although UVa students receive a discount when using their student email at checkout. The money generated from the sale of the cutouts will go to UVa athletics to provide funding for student-athlete support services, according to a release from the school. Fans can also pick up their cutout at the end of the season. If a fan lives wants the cutout shipped to them, they can spend an additional $20 for shipping. There are a series of rules for the cutout to be approved, which can be found on the page where the cutout purchase is made.","630":"In a typical season, the Virginia football team schedules a nonconference team or two well below the Cavaliers\u2019 ability. The scheduling decisions come for a variety of reasons. Scheduling an FCS team brings with it a payday for the lower-level squad, which typically receives hundreds of thousands of dollars to visit the Wahoos. It also gives UVa a chance to play underclassmen early in the season, allowing numerous players to make their collegiate debuts and earn reps on the field after grueling practices. Last year, UVa beat William & Mary 52-17 in the second game of the year. Virginia beat Richmond 42-13 to open the season the year prior. The games gave the FCS teams important financial boosts, while offering UVa a chance to win a home game in blowout fashion. Not every FCS matchup results in a blowout \u2014 the Cavaliers lost to Richmond in 2016 \u2014 but winning Power 5 programs usually overwhelm average FCS squads. This fall, however, Virginia\u2019s lone nonconference game didn\u2019t come until Nov. 21. After weeks of following health protocols and battling through practices and seven games, UVa (4-4, 3-4 ACC) demolished Abilene Christian 55-15 as plenty of new faces took the field. \u201cThey\u2019ve really done everything I\u2019ve asked them, and we\u2019ve asked them, to do as a coaching staff,\u201d head coach Bronco Mendenhall said. \u201cIt was just really gratifying to see smiles from so many players that hadn\u2019t had a chance to play this year in a real game after they\u2019ve been just practicing, laboring and working and trying to help their teammates and this program move forward.\u201d Eight players made their UVa debut Saturday, including linebacker D\u2019Sean Perry. Perry broke the rock after the game thanks to a thrilling play to end the blowout. Abilene Christian\u2019s quarterback faced pressure, took a hit and his pass floated to Perry. The linebacker bobbled the ball a bit before securing it, hurdling over a defender and racing 84 yards for a touchdown. The first game of the redshirt freshman\u2019s career ended with a touchdown. Former high school teammate Mandy Alonso was thrilled as he watched Perry make the play. \u201cIt was awesome, especially like me playing with him in high school, that was special,\u201d Alonso said. \u201cSeeing him break the rock, that was amazing.\u201d Linebacker Noah Taylor, who returned an interception 85 yards for a touchdown a week ago, made sure to jokingly keep the younger linebacker in his place. Taylor\u2019s interception is the longest interception return by a linebacker in Virginia program history. \u201cHe was like, \u2018Yeah, it\u2019s a good play, but you\u2019re one yard off,\u2019\u201d Perry said. \u201cHe was proud of me, but he let me know he still had the record.\u201d Perry was among the UVa players to take the field Saturday during a challenging season. Some of the players who earned time toward the end of the game don\u2019t typically take the field during ACC games. Despite not taking the field, those players still work every day in practice to prepare. They also follow the strict health protocols needed to avoid contracting COVID-19. Saturday offered those players a chance to enjoy this challenging fall season. \u201cHonestly, it felt surreal,\u201d Perry said. \u201cWhen I caught the ball, it didn\u2019t feel real to me honestly, but tucked the ball in \u2026 it was a surreal moment that I\u2019ve been preparing for a long time.\u201d For Mendenhall, his top takeaway from the game was seeing underclassmen shine. The Cavaliers\u2019 games this fall resulted in competitive ACC showings, not giving Mendenhall a chance to play underclassmen with games out of reach. \u201cTo be able to get so many of those guys in the game was the best part of the game for me \u2014 seeing so many smiles and smiles from so many different players that that I hadn\u2019t seen out there playing and then I think just seeing their teammates that are starters or even the backups getting so much time, how they were cheering for the other guys, so that was really gratifying,\u201d Mendenhall said.","631":"The Virginia men\u2019s basketball team\u2019s season begins in a few days, and the schedule already looks different than when it was first released. UVa opens its season against Maine on Wednesday in \u201cBubbleville\u201d in Connecticut. The Cavaliers were supposed to play Florida two days later at the same location. The game against the Gators won\u2019t happen Friday. Florida announced Sunday that it will stop activities for a week after positive COVID-19 tests and contact tracing. As a result, the Gators and Cavaliers won\u2019t play on Nov. 27. It\u2019s unclear if the two teams may try to reschedule the contest for later in the season or if UVa will replace Florida with another Friday opponent. If the Cavaliers don\u2019t add a new opponent, the Wahoos will play their second game of the year at home against Saint Francis on Dec. 1 following the Nov. 25 opener against Maine. Virginia enters the year as the preseason ACC favorite. The Cavaliers return Kihei Clark at point guard and Jay Huff at center. The two veterans are joined by forward Sam Hauser, a preseason All-ACC first team member. Tony Bennett\u2019s team returns plenty of talent and sits at No. 4 in the preseason AP poll. The Cavaliers remain the reigning national champions after last season\u2019s NCAA Tournament was canceled due to COVID-19. As the following season begins and the Cavaliers aim for another championship, COVID-19 remains a major obstacle to play. The Cavaliers sit just a few days away from the start of their season, and they\u2019re already dealing with a schedule change.","632":"The Virginia men\u2019s basketball team\u2019s 2020-21 season begins in \u201cBubbleville\u201d on Wednesday afternoon when the Cavaliers play Towson. As fans start to feel excitement as Tony Bennett\u2019s team returns to the court, they also need to start researching how to watch their beloved Cavaliers. Unfortunately, COVID-19\u2019s impact means no fans will be allowed at the Mohegan Sun Arena for the neutral-site season opener. Since UVa fans can\u2019t watch the Cavaliers in person, they turn their attention toward their TVs and computers. Virginia\u2019s season-opening game against Maine will be shown on FloHoops, which is a part of FloSports. Understandably, most UVa fans might not be familiar with the streaming service. For those not sure how FloSports works, here\u2019s a rundown of all you need to know to watch Virginia play Towson on Wednesday. Is FloHoops a TV channel? No, FloHoops is not a TV channel. FloSports is a streaming service, so you can watch it on your computer, tablet or mobile device if you\u2019re a cable subscriber. If you use a smart TV, you can download the FloSports app to stream the game on your television, rather than watching on a computer or mobile device. How can I watch FloHoops? The first step in watching FloHoops and UVa\u2019s season opener is creating a FloSports account. This requires going to flosports.tv and selecting the FloHoops option. FloSports includes coverage of about 25 sports, ranging from swimming to lacrosse to competitive dance. UVa men\u2019s basketball fans want to select the FloHoops option. From there, users need to create a login using an email or Facebook account. Users then need to pay for their subscription before they can begin watching. How does pricing work? Users can select from two different pricing models. First, FloSports offers a discounted annual rate. Fans can spend $12.50 per month each month for a year. This gives them access to FloHoops for the entire year and it will cost a total of $150. The second pricing option is a $29.99 monthly rate. While the first option may seem like the better deal, UVa fans who only want to watch the contest against Maine before canceling their FloSports subscription may want to go for the $29.99 monthly option. According to the FloSports website, \u201cIf you cancel your subscription, cancellation will be effective at the end of the current monthly period of yearly period. This means that you will have continued access to your subscription for the remainder of that period, but you will not receive a refund.\u201d If you opt to use the monthly subscription and cancel before the end of your first month, you\u2019ll still receive access to FloHoops for the rest of your one-month subscription period, but you still owe the full $29.99. If you select the annual pricing at $12.50 per month and decide to cancel during the year, you still receive access for the full year, but you owe the full $150 payment. The bottom line To watch the UVa men\u2019s basketball team\u2019s season opener against Maine \u2014 a team UVa beat 46-26 a season ago \u2014 fans need access to FloHoops. That\u2019s going to cost fans about $30 for a monthly subscription or $150 for an annual subscription. It\u2019s up to Virginia fans to decide if the steep price is worth watching the Wahoos compete against a mid-major foe. It\u2019s unlikely any of Virginia\u2019s other games this season take place on FloHoops.","633":"The college basketball season starts Wednesday, and the usual excitement for the season also comes with worry regarding COVID-19. Players and coaches don\u2019t want to become infected with the virus, which has symptoms that can sometimes be severe. North Carolina head coach Roy Williams \u2014 who is 70 years old \u2014 recently said on a media teleconference that people would be crazy not to fear and respect the virus. Some cases of the virus, however, are quite mild with those infected showing minimal or no symptoms. Those infections \u2014 and subsequent contact tracing \u2014 still hold the potential to postpone or cancel games this season. Coming off a season that had no NCAA Tournament because of COVID-19, Virginia men\u2019s basketball players want to play. Playing this year means avoiding COVID-19 as much as possible. Avoiding the virus as a team is only half the battle, as it doesn\u2019t guarantee your opponent won\u2019t face an issue related to COVID-19. UVa\u2019s highly anticipated early-season matchup against Florida, which was originally scheduled for Friday, won\u2019t happen due to positive tests within the Gators\u2019 program. Virginia, the ACC preseason favorite, wants to win this season. It also wants to take the court as much as it safely can. \u201cI\u2019m just hopeful we can get all of our games in, first and foremost,\u201d forward Sam Hauser said on Nov. 9. \u201cIt\u2019s been a lot different, just the outlook to everything, because we really don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen next week, next month, for the rest of the season.\u201d Head coach Tony Bennett echoed Hauser\u2019s thoughts. The Cavaliers want to play, and they don\u2019t know what the season holds. While it\u2019s a bit clich\u00e9d, they\u2019re taking the season one day at a time. \u201cThere\u2019s a good verse in the Bible that says, \u2018Worry about today, for tomorrow has enough trouble of its own,\u2019 so we\u2019re just taking it really like every coach would tell you \u2014 get as good as we can with the ways that we can and prepare and be hopeful,\u201d Bennett said. \u201cYou know, really being hopeful for what could be.\u201d For UVa, what could be is another national championship. Bennett\u2019s group returns Kihei Clark and Jay Huff, and Hauser joins the mix as a talented wing. There\u2019s additional depth surrounding Clark at guard with returning shooting guards Tomas Woldetensae and Casey Morsell. At forward, Justin McKoy should earn minutes for the Wahoos. Other big men include backup center Francisco Caffaro, who can spell Huff when UVa\u2019s star center needs a breather. Three top recruits headline one of UVa\u2019s best freshman classes in recent memory, and all three players could earn minutes this season. The roster looks fantastic for Virginia. The on-court questions are minimal, but off-the-court concerns remain. How many games will the Cavaliers be able to play this fall? If they do play, what will the games be like? Attendance across the country is expected to be minimal given the health risks associated with bringing thousands of people into an indoor arena to watch a game. UVa\u2019s typical home-court advantage of roughly 14,000 fans per home contest may sit at just a few people made up of family members of players and coaches. \u201cIt\u2019d be like scrimmages I guess where there\u2019s nobody in the stands, but it\u2019ll be interesting and we know that we\u2019re gonna have to generate a lot of our own energy throughout the team if there\u2019s not a lot of fans,\u201d Clark said. Even with limited fans, the game remains the same. As college football programs have shown throughout the fall, talent, depth and experience still matter. Teams like Alabama, Clemson, Notre Dame and Ohio State look to be among the nation\u2019s best football programs, which doesn\u2019t differ much from a typical college football season. The college basketball season figures to play out differently than a normal year in some ways. Players may miss contests due to positive COVID-19 tests or contact tracing, and schedules should be written in pencil as they are all but guaranteed to be altered. Rowdy college basketball environments will be replaced by empty gyms and the sound of sneakers squeaking on the court. At the same time, it\u2019s still basketball. In some ways, the virus makes it easier for student-athletes to focus solely on basketball and their teammates, which could lead to the historically great programs with elite coaches finding the most success. \u201cIn terms of basketball-wise, it\u2019s been a time where you can kind of really lock in on basketball itself,\u201d Hauser said. \u201cNot having in-person classes, you\u2019re having online classes you kind of have more time to spend with your teammates on and off the court, so I think in that aspect it\u2019s been good for basketball.\u201d As the season begins, the Wahoos don\u2019t know what lies ahead. They expect a different season with fewer fans and more postponements. The focus lies on getting through each day and attempting to stay safe. COVID-19 will certainly impact the 2020-21 college basketball season. The Cavaliers hope to minimize that impact as much as they possibly can. \u201cYou just try to prepare as best as possible and just try to maintain your distance and just try to stay safe so you can be able to go out there and compete,\u201d Clark said. \u201cJust try to make sure your teammates are staying safe and make sure they\u2019re following protocols but anything can happen, so you don\u2019t really know what to expect.\u201d","634":"William Trent Jr. has made many trips to Lannigan Field, both as a spectator and participant. He will be seeing a lot more of the University of Virginia\u2019s track and field facility in the coming years. The Monticello High School senior has verbally committed to join the Cavaliers\u2019 men\u2019s track and field program. \u201cDuring these times of craziness [with COVID-19], UVa has been one of the few consistent things,\u201d Trent said. \u201cOne of my earliest memories date back to waking up early in the morning to go sit at the Dogwood track meet all day as my entire family went to volunteer, coach or both. It only feels right to continue what they started way before I was born.\u201d Trent\u2019s familial ties to track and field date back generations. His grandfather, Curtis Elder, was a legendary track and field coach at Charlottesville High School and the school\u2019s track complex bears his name. His mother, Erica Elder Trent, was a hurdler and sprinter at Albemarle High School. Will Trent Sr. threw the shot put and discus and ran the 4x100-meter relay during his time at Heritage High School in Lynchburg. The Monticello senior has carried on the family\u2019s tradition of track and field success. As a sophomore, Trent won the VHSL Class 3 state outdoor title in the 400 meters (49.35) with a diving finish. He also finished seventh in the 200 (23.87). Last March, Trent followed that up with a pair of indoor state titles in the 300 (34.75) and 500 (1:05.47) at the VHSL Class 3 championships at Liberty University. UVa director of track and field Vin Lananna was in attendance at last March\u2019s state meet and the staff quickly identified Trent as a candidate to join the Cavaliers program. \u201cSince Day 1, they have shown me why I should want to be a part of the team,\u201d Trent said. \u201c[Assistant coach Mario] Wilson has been a huge influence on my decision. He has been straight up and honest with me from the beginning and has proved more and more why I would fit in perfectly with the team.\u201d Trent said he had opportunities to compete at a number of schools, including Appalachian State, Northeastern, Bucknell and Army, but noted the relationship with the coaches at Virginia was unmatched. \u201cOne of the biggest factors that set UVa apart from the others is the future the school has,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter hiring the legendary Coach Lananna, I knew something special was in the works. Coach Lananna is known for greatness, working with top-tier athletes and making all those around him better. After a Zoom meeting with him and other coaches, I knew it was the place for me.\u201d Outstanding coaching wasn\u2019t the lone draw to Virginia. \u201cI have always liked UVa\u2019s athletic programs, but more importantly, the school\u2019s academic programs are amazing,\u201d Trent said. \u201cUVa is a great school to get an education from and I believe that it will open many doors for me in the future.\u201d Trent has been a multievent performer for Monticello during his high school career and hopes to continue that trend at the collegiate level. \u201cWe have not really discussed any exact plans yet,\u201d Trent said. \u201cI do know that I don\u2019t have to specialize in one event and I can continue to go up and down in ranges or races. UVa already has a top-tier middle-distance and sprints group. My personal plan is to learn from them and grow as a person and athlete so that I can work to compete in the best environment with the best competition.\u201d Trent plans to major in kinesiology and pursue a career in physical therapy. \u201cI want to go into the field of rehabilitation or something that involves helping athletes get back to the sport they love,\u201d Trent said. On the track, his goals are simple \u2014 work hard and earn his place. \u201cI\u2019m not used to being the little guy on the track, so I\u2019m excited to work and prove that I belong here,\u201d Trent said. \u201cMy main goal is to prove myself that all the work that I have put in for years in advance is now paying off and the results were worth the wait.\u201d After a grueling recruiting process that limited school visits and in-person meetings with coaches, Trent is excited to have his decision finalized and not have to answer awkward questions about where he was going to school next year. In addition, hopefully it will solve those restless nights worrying about his college decision. In the end, UVa, was the perfect fit for Trent. \u201cIt honestly means everything to be able to reach this point and continue my career at UVa,\u201d Trent said. \u201cI have always wanted to go to the next level, regardless of what sport or route I take. I am well aware that the job is not done, but it feels absolutely amazing to have reached one of my biggest goals that was set long before high school. This opportunity is going to lead to many great experiences, but in order to reach them, I can\u2019t settle.\u201d","635":"The Virginia football team, fresh off a 55-15 win over Abilene Christian, returns to the field Saturday for its first road trip since an Oct. 24 visit to Miami. The Cavaliers return to the Sunshine State for a prime-time clash at Florida State. Bronco Mendenhall\u2019s team enters this weekend\u2019s game sitting at 4-4 overall and 3-4 in the ACC. A victory over the 2-6 Seminoles would improve the Wahoos to .500 in conference games this fall. Mendenhall as well as two Virginia players spoke with the media virtually Monday. Here are some of the highlights from the discussion. Meet Matt Gahm Maybe the most relevant news this week is Charles Snowden\u2019s injury. The talented linebacker suffered an ankle injury against Abilene Christian. He underwent surgery on the ankle and will miss the rest of the season for Virginia. Without Snowden, the Cavaliers are down a number of starters, including Richard Burney (health issues) and Jowon Briggs (transfer). Safeties Joey Blount and Brenton Nelson have also missed significant playing time in recent weeks with injuries. The defense is battered. \u201cMost of our issues in terms of depth and roster now are not COVID-related but injury-related, which is coming through just the wear and tear of a long season and probably the most difficult schedule I\u2019ve ever taken on as a head coach,\u201d Mendenhall said. In Snowden\u2019s place, the Cavaliers turn to Matt Gahm. The senior linebacker draws praise from his coaches, who say he\u2019s one of their more reliable performers. He now takes over a larger role for the Wahoos as a starting linebacker with Snowden out. \u201cIt was hard seeing a teammate, especially one that I\u2019ve been around so long, a good friend of mine, go down,\u201d Gahm said. \u201cWe were all very sad to see that, after the game in the locker room, trying to comfort him as much as possible.\u201d Gahm says his mentality won\u2019t change even as his role might increase. \u201cJust put my helmet on, go to work like I always do,\u201d Gahm said. A player rarely talked about in the press, Gahm enters Saturday\u2019s contest with limited hype. Snowden entered each game as one of UVa\u2019s top NFL prospects and a vocal leader both on and off the field. When people think of UVa football in 2020, Snowden comes to mind. Gahm made a joke toward the end of his time speaking with the media, saying, \u201cTook me four years to get a press conference. Feels good.\u201d Even with the increased eyes watching him this week, Gahm wants to do whatever his peers need. He wants to win games, and he\u2019s happy playing the majority of snaps Saturday or yielding some time to fellow linebackers in an effort to replace Snowden\u2019s production with multiple bodies. \u201cI don\u2019t really care what the media says,\u201d Gahm said. \u201cI don\u2019t care what the fans think. I care about fighting for my teammates next to me and the guys that I go to work with every day. Whatever this program needs me to do, I\u2019m going to do. I don\u2019t care how much limelight I get, I don\u2019t care how much attention I get; I don\u2019t do it for that. I do it for my teammates and my coaches.\u201d Florida State\u2019s test The Cavaliers will travel to Tallahassee to face the Seminoles on Saturday at 8 p.m. on the ACC Network. Saturday marks the fourth night kickoff of Virginia\u2019s season, and every ACC game for the Cavaliers this fall has aired on the ACC Network. Despite the Seminoles owning a 2-6 record, Mendenhall and company aren\u2019t overlooking the challenges posed by FSU. Virginia respects Florida State\u2019s tradition and raw talent, as well as the new coaching staff led by head coach Mike Norvell. \u201cIf you put stock into the recruiting rankings and you look at just the quality of a roster and now you add a new staff \u2014 they\u2019re being coached well and I\u2019m talking about the discipline, the alignments, the assignments, the schemes \u2014 I see a transformation happening as there\u2019s a new staff and players kind of coming together,\u201d Mendenhall said. Thanksgiving as a team As the Cavaliers prepare to face the Seminoles, they\u2019ll celebrate Thanksgiving as a team. Mendenhall asked players and families to avoid traveling if possible this Thanksgiving due to the spread of COVID-19. UVa\u2019s athletic department shared Monday that it produced zero positive COVID-19 tests in the 1,138 tests issued from Nov. 16-22. The Cavaliers have done well to limit the spread of the virus, and they hope to keep it that way. Mendenhall says he\u2019s hoping to provide some sort of day within COVID-19 protocols that allows for a safe Thanksgiving celebration. \u201cI\u2019m not gonna lie, it sucks,\u201d senior cornerback Nick Grant said. \u201cThat\u2019s just that, but that is the sacrifice that we have to make this season.\u201d Grant added that in a typical season, heading home isn\u2019t always possible given UVa\u2019s hectic schedule and usual Thanksgiving weekend battles with Virginia Tech. Even without a Thanksgiving with family, Grant says the Cavaliers will work through it and enjoy time spent around each other. \u201cWe\u2019re not too worried about it, just be with each other, show each other love,\u201d Grant said.","636":"The University of Virginia athletics department administered 1,138 COVID-19 tests from Nov. 16-22. Of those tests, none came back positive, according to a release from the school Monday. The UVa athletic department has not a positive COVID-19 test for two consecutive weeks and only one this month so far. The program administered 3,009 tests between Nov. 2 and Nov. 22 and only one of those tests came back positive. Since testing began on July 5, UVa athletics has reported 92 total positives out of the 12,073 tests administered to student-athletes and staff members. Saturday marked the second consecutive game that all UVa football players and coaches were available. No player or coach missed the game for a positive test or contact tracing. \u201cIt is absolutely remarkable and inspiring to me,\u201d Virginia coach Bronco Mendenhall said Monday. \u201cI use those words, but I can\u2019t tell them in a way that really reflects it. I see them every morning, and there they all are again. There\u2019s no one contact traced. We\u2019re going on Week 9 of the season, and I don\u2019t know how many weeks we had in the preseason before this, and here they still are. It just is absolutely remarkable.\u201d Mendenhall says he\u2019s maintained a focus on preventing the virus throughout the season, despite fans and media members shifting focus toward Virginia\u2019s on-field play. He remains proud of his program as it avoids the virus as well as it possibly can. \u201cI know the minute we started playing games, all I\u2019ve been asked about is the outcome and the record, but wow, what a huge story would be missed if that\u2019s all that\u2019s focused on,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I get it, I know it\u2019s an outcome-oriented game, but that in and off itself is one of the most amazing things I\u2019ve ever been part of in terms of commitment and resilience.\u201d The Cavs go to Florida State for a game Saturday, hoping to extend their three-game winning streak while also maintaining the streak of weeks with zero positive COVID-19 test results within the program.","637":"Virginia men\u2019s basketball players and coaches were preparing for a game in the ACC Tournament when they learned the tournament was off. Soon after the conference tournament was canceled, the Cavaliers learned the NCAA Tournament also was off due to COVID-19. Eight months later, college basketball returns. Virginia opens its season Wednesday against Towson. The game takes place in Connecticut, and no fans will be present. The game location and atmosphere in \u201cBubbleville\u201d signals that the pandemic is not yet over. We know more about COVID-19 than we did when the pandemic arrived in full force in March, but it remains a major obstacle to the completion of games. Virginia\u2019s game scheduled for Friday against Florida no longer sits on the schedule due to positive tests within the Gators\u2019 program. The season-opening opponent changed from Maine to Towson after Maine had COVID-19 issues. Even with the pandemic likely to alter schedules and create an unusual and disjointed season, the financial need to have an NCAA Tournament coupled with COVID-19 vaccine development makes the completion of the Big Dance likely to occur at some point in the next 4-8 months. College basketball is coming back, even with COVID-19 still affecting the sport in late November. For UVa, the return of game action means another chance to defend its 2018-19 national championship. It also means a chance to break in new faces such as Marquette transfer Sam Hauser and one of the best freshman classes in the Tony Bennett era. The journey begins Wednesday. \u201cI can\u2019t wait,\u201d said Hauser, who sat out last season due to transfer rules. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve been on the floor to play in a game. I\u2019m ecstatic.\u201d We all are. With the Cavaliers nearing the start of their 2019-20 season, let\u2019s break down the team\u2019s roster, schedule highlights and preseason expectations. Roster overview Virginia\u2019s roster features depth at nearly every position as well as a mix of experience and youth. At the guard position, the Wahoos are led by Kihei Clark. The point guard returns for his third season in Charlottesville, and he\u2019s still yet to lose an NCAA Tournament game. Clark \u2014 a gifted facilitator \u2014 should see ample opportunities for assists with Hauser and Jay Huff likely manning the floor at the same time. Reece Beekman, a talented freshman point guard, possesses the talent and passing ability to back up Clark when needed. Beekman\u2019s addition gives UVa a chance to play Clark fewer than the ACC-leading 37.1 minutes per game he averaged a season ago. They may also take the court at the same time if the Cavaliers elect to play with a smaller lineup. \u201cWhatever the team wants me to do, that\u2019s what I\u2019m willing to do,\u201d Clark said. \u201cBut it\u2019d be nice to get some rest and some minutes off and hopefully we will get to play with each other. But hey, if I could get some rest here and there, it would be nice.\u201d Walk-on guards Chase Coleman, Jayden Nixon and Malachi Poindexter add depth at the guard positions. At shooting guard, Tomas Woldetensae and Casey Morsell should see significant minutes. Freshman sharpshooter Carson McCorkle may also earn time. Morsell played excellent defense a season ago as a freshman, but struggled with his shot. Morsell knocked down just 17.6% of his 3-point shots despite converting at an 85.7% clip from the free-throw line and showcasing a decent shooting stroke. He\u2019s expected to improve offensively in Year 2. Woldetensae, who began his UVa career last year after transferring in from a junior college, led the team in made 3-pointers a season ago while shooting 36.1% from beyond the arc. He added muscle over the offseason, and Bennett believes he\u2019s more comfortable after a season of ACC action. \u201cTom has really gone to work in the offseason and worked hard,\u201d Bennett said. \u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s gonna win a bodybuilding contest, but he is stronger and he\u2019s worked at it.\u201d At the wing spot, the Cavaliers boast a few talented performers, headlined by Hauser. The Marquette transfer sat out last season due to NCAA transfer rules, and he\u2019s expected to be a top contributor after shooting 44% from 3-point range during his three seasons at Marquette. Other potential contributors include freshman Jabri Abdur-Rahim, a gifted scorer with NBA potential. Trey Murphy III transferred from Rice, and he was expected to take the year off to redshirt and get stronger. With every player receiving additional eligibility, Murphy III could potentially receive a waiver from the NCAA to play immediately. Kody Stattmann, who Bennett says grew during the offseason, stands at about 6-foot-8. He\u2019s an option at guard and on the wing. Improved shooting touch will be a key to Stattmann taking the floor consistently. He made just 26.9% of his 3-point shots last season. At forward, Justin McKoy continues to earn praise from teammates for his on-court effort and work ethic in practice. Kadin Shedrick, a redshirt freshman who is 6-11, also possesses the athleticism necessary to contribute in the post if needed. \u201cI think Justin and Kadin definitely got better,\u201d Hauser said. \u201cThey took steps in the right direction. I\u2019m excited to see Kadin. Obviously he redshirted with me with last year, so I\u2019m excited to see him on the floor, and I think Justin is going to surprise a lot of people this year.\u201d Charlottesville native Austin Katstra adds depth at the forward spot, although he\u2019s not expected to receive significant minutes. Virginia boasts a pair of impressive centers. Jay Huff stands at 7-1, while Francisco Caffaro checks in at 7-0. Huff holds NBA potential entering what\u2019s expected to be his final collegiate season, and Caffaro is described similarly to former UVa center Jack Salt. Caffaro adds physical toughness, while Huff is a more versatile player with offensive finesse and defensive shot-blocking talent. Entering this season, the Cavaliers are deep. It\u2019s unclear how deep the rotation might extend by season\u2019s end, but the Cavaliers have at least 10 players deserving of playing time. \u201cI think the best team will hopefully be put on the floor,\u201d Bennett said, \u201cand whether that\u2019s nine, 10, eight, whatever, so be it.\u201d Schedule highlights Virginia is scheduled to play 20 ACC games this season, with perhaps a defining stretch coming in February, when the Cavaliers face North Carolina, Florida State and Duke in consecutive games. Competing in the ACC always presents a challenge, even for the team picked to win the league this preseason. ACC competition begins for Virginia on Dec. 16, when the Cavaliers travel to Wake Forest. The nonconference schedule for UVa includes a few exciting matchups. Unfortunately, Virginia\u2019s showdown with Florida, which was set for Friday, won\u2019t happen this week due to COVID-19 issues within the Gators\u2019 program. The games against Michigan State and Villanova more than make up for any missed matchups. Tom Izzo and the Spartans visit Charlottesville on Dec. 9, while the Wahoos head to Madison Square Garden to face Villanova on Dec. 19. It\u2019s a good nonconference schedule for Virginia. It tests the Cavaliers, while also giving fans a few games to circle on the calendar. \u201cI\u2019m excited,\u201d Clark said. \u201cI like playing against the top teams, that\u2019s why I came here, so I can\u2019t wait to play the big-time schools, but like I said, we\u2019re going to come in to any game with the same mindset, no matter who we play but I\u2019m definitely excited.\u201d Preseason hype Entering the year, UVa sits at No. 4 in the AP poll. The Cavaliers were picked to win the ACC. They\u2019re also still the reigning national champions after last year\u2019s NCAA Tournament was canceled due to COVID-19. The preseason hype for the Cavaliers is high, but Bennett tells his team to view themselves as a blue-collar team rather than a college basketball blue blood. On the outside, preseason expectations are lofty. Internally, the Cavaliers want to block out the expectations as they embark on the season. While being the reigning national champions is a fun feeling, it doesn\u2019t mean much to the Cavaliers, especially with so many of the key contributors from the championship team no longer in the program. \u201cI think I remember that at Purdue last year, that didn\u2019t carry us too far,\u201d Bennett laughed, remembering the team\u2019s 29-point road loss to the Boilermakers. As UVa fans relish the joy of being the last team to win the national title, Virginia\u2019s players don\u2019t place their attention on past achievements. \u201cWe actually haven\u2019t talked about it all, to be honest,\u201d Clark said. \u201cWe know what\u2019s happened in the past, and we know we can look back on it, but I know this group of guys, they\u2019re looking into the future and we know what we want to accomplish this year, right now.\u201d","638":"Tuesday brought with it significant Virginia men\u2019s basketball news. The Cavaliers lost their season-opening opponent a day before the game, and the ACC announced a change in venue for the conference tournament in March. In positive news, the Wahoos learned the tipoff time and TV designation for its highly anticipated matchup with Michigan State. UVa gets new opponents Virginia was scheduled to open its season Wednesday against Maine. That game won\u2019t happen after Maine received positive COVID-19 test results, knocking it out of \u201cBubbleville.\u201d Instead, UVa will open the season Wednesday at 1:30 p.m. against Towson. The Tigers finished 19-13 last season, going 12-6 in the Colonial Athletic Association. They\u2019re picked to finish fourth in the CAA this season, and they did receive four first-place votes in the CAA preseason poll. The Cavaliers also know their scheduled opponent for Friday. San Francisco men\u2019s basketball shared Monday that it will face Virginia on Friday. The Cavaliers were originally supposed to face Florida on Friday, but the Gators opted not to compete in \u201cBubbleville\u201d in Connecticut due to positive COVID-19 tests within their program. Instead, the Wahoos will face San Francisco, a team from the West Coast Conference. The game is slated to tip off at 11:30 a.m. and it will air on ESPN. The Dons went 22-12 a season ago, earning signature wins against Cal and BYU. They finished with a 9-7 mark in conference play. San Francisco has won at least 20 games in four consecutive years. Heading into this season, the Dons were picked by the league\u2019s coaches to finish fifth in the WCC. Senior guard Jamaree Bouyea is the top player for San Francisco. He averaged 12.2 points and 3.5 assists a season ago. Barring additional schedule changes, the game against San Francisco will complete Virginia\u2019s time in Bubbleville. The Cavaliers face Towson on Wednesday and San Francisco on Friday before heading to Charlottesville for a Tuesday matchup with Saint Francis. Tony Bennett\u2019s team, which was picked to win the ACC, hopes to complete both neutral-site games safely while also learning a bit about its potential rotation. A Dec. 9 showdown with Michigan State looms on the calendar, and the Cavaliers will need to be at their best to take down the Spartans after playing four lesser nonconference foes. ACC Tournament change The 2021 ACC men\u2019s basketball tournament will be held in Greensboro, North Carolina. The ACC announced the news Wednesday, shifting the tournament location from Washington D.C. to Greensboro because of the pandemic. The 2024 ACC Tournament will be held in Washington D.C. at Capital One Arena. \u201cThe ACC men\u2019s basketball tournament has enjoyed terrific experiences and hospitality at Capital One Arena,\u201d ACC commissioner John Swofford said in a statement. \u201cWe look forward to returning to Washington, D.C., and appreciate Greensboro for welcoming and accommodating us during these unique and challenging times.\u201d UVa-MSU tipoff time revealed Virginia\u2019s Dec. 9 game against Michigan State will tip off at 9:15 p.m., the ACC announced Tuesday. The game will air on ESPN. The matchup is part of the ACC\/Big Ten challenge, and it pits UVa\u2019s Sam Hauser against his younger brother Joey, who plays at Michigan State. The game also features a coaching battle between Virginia\u2019s Tony Bennett and Michigan State\u2019s Tom Izzo. UVa hosts the matchup at John Paul Jones Arena, but severely limited attendance is expected due to health guidelines. Fortunately, fans can view the game on national TV.","639":"Of the games played, few results were shocking, with the exception of Pitt\u2019s 47-14 beatdown of Virginia Tech. Earlier in the season, the Hokies seemed like they\u2019d be the clear favorite for the Dec. 12 Commonwealth Clash with Virginia. Now, the Wahoos seem like the superior team. They\u2019ll settle that debate on the field in just a few weeks. 1. Notre Dame (8-0, 7-0 ACC, No. 1 last week): Notre Dame returns from its bye week to be greeted by a massive road challenge. Sam Howell and North Carolina\u2019s high powered offense host the Fighting Irish on Friday. With Syracuse and Wake Forest left on the schedule following the UNC game, a win goes a long way toward Notre Dame locking down its spot in the ACC Championship Game. Up next: at North Carolina, Friday, 3:30 p.m. 2. Clemson (7-1, 6-1 ACC, No. 2 last week): The Tigers\u2019 scheduled game with Florida State was postponed hours before kickoff after the two teams disagreed on the health protocols surrounding the contest. Clemson head coach Dabo Swinney wasn\u2019t happy with the decision, and both teams have bickered back and forth at each other in recent days about whether the decision to postpone was correct. Up next: vs. Pittsburgh, Saturday, 3:30 p.m. 3. Miami (7-1, 6-1 ACC, No. 3 last week): Due to COVID-19 issues, the Hurricanes won\u2019t play again this weekend. They\u2019re hoping to play Dec. 5 at Wake Forest. Up next: Bye 4. North Carolina (6-2, 6-2 ACC, No. 4 last week): UNC didn\u2019t play last week, giving the Tar Heels extra time to prepare for Friday\u2019s matchup with Notre Dame. North Carolina possesses plenty of firepower to beat the Irish, but needs significant improvement defensively to pull off the upset. Up next: vs. Notre Dame, Friday, 3:30 p.m. 5. N.C. State (6-3, 5-3 ACC, No. 5 last week): Finally, a team in the power poll that played an actual football game last week. The Wolfpack pulled out a gritty 15-14 win over Liberty, thanks to a blocked field goal in the final two minutes of the game. With no timeouts when the field goal was attempted, N.C. State couldn\u2019t pull a Virginia Tech and erase an important blocked kick late in the game against the Flames. Up next: at Syracuse, Saturday, noon 6. Wake Forest (4-3, 3-3 ACC, No. 6 last week): There was no game for the Demon Deacons last weekend after their matchup with Duke was canceled. They\u2019re off again this Saturday. Up next: Bye 7. Boston College (5-4, 4-4 ACC, No. 7 last week): Another team that didn\u2019t play last weekend, Boston College returns to the field with a winnable home game against Louisville. A win would be the Eagles' sixth this fall. Up next: vs. Louisville, Saturday, 4 p.m. 8. Virginia (4-4, 3-4 ACC, No. 8 last week): QB Brennan Armstrong excelled for UVa on Saturday, putting up more than 400 yards in a 55-15 victory over Abilene Christian. The offensive showing, particularly in the passing game, is a major positive for the Wahoos moving forward. Losing star linebacker Charles Snowden to a broken ankle, however, is a major blow the rest of the year. Up next: at Florida State, Saturday, 8 p.m. 9. Pittsburgh (5-4, 4-4 ACC, No. 10 last week): Pitt obliterated Virginia Tech on Saturday, winning 47-14. The Hokies struggled offensively, and the Panthers racked up more than 400 passing yards as Kenny Pickett performed well. DJ Turner brought in 15 receptions for the Panthers, racking up 184 yards and a touchdown. Up next: at Clemson, Saturday, 3:30 p.m. 10. Virginia Tech (4-5, 4-4 ACC, No. 9 last week): A 33-point loss to Pittsburgh isn\u2019t what Virginia Tech needed. The Hokies are sliding as fans begin to question whether Justin Fuente is the right man to lead the program. Virginia Tech is on a three-game losing streak, falling to Liberty, Miami and Pitt. A losing regular-season record is almost a guarantee with Clemson and Virginia left on the schedule. Up next: Bye 11. Georgia Tech (2-5, 2-4 ACC, No. 11 last week): The Yellow Jackets weren\u2019t able to play Miami last weekend due to COVID-19 issues with the Hurricanes, but they expect to take the field this weekend. Georgia Tech hosts Duke in a battle of ACC bottom dwellers. The winning team picks up win No. 3. Up next: vs. Duke, Saturday, 7 p.m. 12. Louisville (3-6, 2-6 ACC, No. 12 last week): If a team is struggling, it helps to play Syracuse. Louisville lost six of its last seven games before running over the Orange. The Cardinals won 30-0, and they allowed just 137 total yards. It was an easy win for a team in desperate need of a victory. Up next: at Boston College, Saturday, 4 p.m. 13. Florida State (2-6, 1-6 ACC, No. 13 last week): The Seminoles opted not to play Saturday, feeling uncomfortable with Clemson\u2019s handling of a player with COVID-19 symptons. They took the week off as a result, but they\u2019ll face Virginia this weekend. The Seminoles need improvement in all three phases to beat a confident and improving UVa squad. Up next: vs. Virginia, Saturday, 8 p.m. 14. Duke (2-6, 1-6 ACC, No. 14 last week): The Blue Devils\u2019 game with Wake Forest was canceled. They face Georgia Tech this week with a chance to win an ACC game against a team other than Syracuse. Duke could use a positive result over a fellow ACC bottom dweller. Up next: at Georgia Tech, Saturday, 7 p.m. 15. Syracuse (1-8, 1-7 ACC, No. 15 last week): College basketball season began Wednesday, and the Orange\u2019s men team starts play Friday. That\u2019s a welcomed sight for Syracuse sports fans, as the football team sits at 1-8. There\u2019s little reason to believe Syracuse can beat N.C. State or Notre Dame to win a second time this fall. Up next: vs. N.C. State, Saturday, noon","640":"That gives our panel the chance to tackle a few more ACC contests. This season, I\u2019m joined each week by Richmond Times-Dispatch columnist David Teel, Roanoke Times Columnist Aaron McFarling and Charlottesville Daily Progress Virginia beat writer Bennett Conlin. We\u2019ll pick games involving Virginia Tech and UVA, along with one other key ACC match up. Then, to create a little more separation in the standings, we\u2019ll each predict on upset against the spread from anywhere on the FBS board. I can be thankful for a 4-0 week that helped me regain first place in our standings, with two weeks left. Here are this week\u2019s picks:  Virginia at Florida State, 8 p.m., Doak Campbell Stadium Mike Barber, Richmond Times-Dispatch (23-12): Virginia has gotten on a bit of a roll here down the stretch. Of course, getting by Abilene Christian without linebacker Charles Snowden and offensive lineman Dillon Reinkensmeyer was one thing. Even this bad Florida State team will put up more resistance than the Wildcats could muster last week. But not too much more. THE PICK: Virginia 31, Florida State 24 Aaron McFarling, Roanoke Times (22-12): The Cavaliers (-9) have morphed into such a covering machine that they headlined Scott Van Pelt\u2019s \u201cBad Beats\u201d segment last week with their last-second pick-six that doomed Abilene Christian bettors. UVA makes it six covers in a row with a comfortable win against the wheezing \u2018Noles. THE PICK: Virginia 35, Florida State 21 Bennett Conlin, Charlottesville Daily Progress (22-13): Even with defensive injuries, the Cavaliers can take down the Seminoles. Brennan Armstrong gives Virginia a legitimate passing attack, and the offensive line remains steady. Florida State, on the other hand, is anything but steady. THE PICK: Virginia 38, Florida State 20 David Teel, Richmond Times-Dispatch (18-17): The Seminoles are allowing 36.1 points per game in head coach Mike Norvell's debut season, the most in this storied program's history, and their most vulnerable to the pass. What is the Cavaliers' strength on offense? Brennan Armstrong's passing. THE PICK: Virginia 35, Florida State 17.  Notre Dame at North Carolina, 3:30 p.m. Friday, Kenan Stadium Barber: Going into the season, we all believed Clemson and Notre Dame were on a crash course to face each other in the title game in Charlotte. The wildcard? Mack Brown\u2019s North Carolina team. But the Irish defense will be able to contain the Tar Heels attack in this one, all but assuring the Tigers-Irish rematch in Charlotte. THE PICK: Notre Dame 38, North Carolina 31 McFarling: The road team has covered in each of the past four meetings between these teams. Notre Dame (-4.5) has covered in its past six November games and its most recent five matchups against winning teams. The Irish have answered every question so far this year and will again. THE PICK: Notre Dame 40, North Carolina 28 Conlin: Both teams possess top-tier quarterbacks and offensive playmakers. The winner may need to reach 40 points in a game with shootout potential. While the Tar Heels can score with anyone, they struggle to generate defensive stops. THE PICK: Notre Dame 45, North Carolina 35 Teel: So good is this Black Friday clash that A-listers Chris Fowler, Kirk Herbstreit and Maria Taylor comprise the broadcast team. The difference between the No. 2 Fighting Irish and No. 19 Tar Heels is defense, and it will show as UNC struggles to run the ball. THE PICK: Notre Dame 35, North Carolina 31 Pittsburgh at Clemson, 3:30 p.m., Memorial Stadium Barber: Pittsburgh dominated Virginia Tech last weekend in a 47-14 win. The Panthers defense was as good as advertised in the preseason and Kenny Pickett and the offense were equally as impressive. But man, Clemson has no shortage of motivation in this one. They were beaten by Notre Dame the last time they played and they felt shortchanged by Florida State\u2019s decision not to play them Saturday due to COVID-19. Angry Tigers are tough to tame. THE PICK: Clemson 42, Pittsburgh 20 McFarling: The Tigers, who are just 2-7 against the spread in their past nine games (2-6 this season), opened with a big ol\u2019 26.5 points to try to cover here. That, though, was quickly bet down to 24, as Pitt\u2019s getting some backing after its blowout of Virginia Tech. The Panthers will lose but cash tickets. THE PICK: Clemson 35, Pittsburgh 14 Conlin: Dabo Swinney will have the Tigers fired up after last week's game was postponed. Trevor Lawrence returns for Clemson, which should provide an emotional lift. Pitt performed well against Virginia Tech, but the Hokies aren't Clemson. THE PICK: Clemson 48, Pitt 17 Teel: Think the Tigers were frothing after their double-overtime loss at Notre Dame? Well, compound that with last week's COVID postponement at Florida State. Oh, and this is Trevor Lawrence's first game since Oct. 24. THE PICK: Clemson 38, Pitt 21 Upset of the week Barber: Kansas State has lost three in a row, but Baylor has been bad all year. The Wildcats haven\u2019t beaten the Bears in two years, but that should change this weekend. Kansas State shouldn\u2019t have much trouble moving the ball against Baylor, and will win a shootout. THE PICK: Kansas State 42, Baylor 35 McFarling: Some \u201cBig Game\u201d this is, with both teams sitting at 0-2. The Cardinal is 5-0 ATS in the past five meetings at Cal and used an unexpected open date last week -- Washington State had COVID-19 issues -- to try to get its defense right. Trust David Shaw here and back the 1.5-point pup. THE PICK: Stanford 30, Cal 24 Conlin: Kansas State desperately needs a bounceback victory, and Baylor sits at just 1-5 this fall. It's hard to like a 1-5 team with a subpar offense against a well-coached Kansas State program. THE PICK: Kansas State 20, Baylor 17 Teel: Comrade McFarling grew up in Maryland and pitched for the Terrapins. I grew up in Maryland and attended Lefty Driesell's basketball camp. That's it. That's the explanation. THE PICK: Maryland 30, Indiana 28","641":"For the second consecutive Saturday, a Florida State football game was postponed on game day. This one impacts Virginia, which was scheduled to compete against the Seminoles on Saturday night at Doak Campbell Stadium in Tallahassee. Instead, positive COVID-19 tests and subsequent quarantining and contact tracing within Florida State\u2019s football program led to a postponement. The ACC announced the news Saturday morning. \u201cOur team underwent the mandated third-party testing yesterday and learned late last night that we had one positive test,\u201d Florida State director of athletics David Coburn said in a statement Saturday. \u201cContact tracing this morning determined that, with opt-outs and injuries, we had just 44 scholarship players for the game, with some position groups depleted almost entirely.\u201d No makeup date was announced, although both teams have open dates on Dec. 19. Virginia flew into Tallahassee prior to the game, expecting to play Saturday. UVa\u2019s plan as of Saturday morning was to fly home without having competed despite having paid for the trip to Tallahassee and back. \u201cWe deeply regret that many Florida State and Virginia fans have already traveled to the game as well as Virginia\u2019s team,\u201d Coburn said. \u201cWe simply had no way of knowing we would not be playing until this morning. We made every effort to play, but we could not do so in a way that was safe for the players.\u201d The same thing happened to Clemson last week. After the Tigers traveled to Tallahassee to face Florida State, the two medical staffs disagreed about safely playing on Saturday after a Clemson player tested positive for the virus. Clemson head coach Dabo Swinney disagreed with the decision, publicly voicing his opinion throughout the week. This is UVa\u2019s third scheduled ACC game impacted by COVID-19. The Cavaliers were scheduled to open the season with Virginia Tech, but issues with the virus at Virginia Tech led to a postponement. Earlier this month, the Virginia-Louisville game was postponed a week after the Cardinals dealt with COVID-19 issues. Saturday\u2019s news marks the third time a Virginia game was postponed and each instance was caused by COVID-19 issues with Virginia\u2019s opponent. The Cavaliers, who have won three straight games, won\u2019t play this weekend. They return home, hoping to play on Dec. 5 against Boston College at Scott Stadium. On the bright side, BC has not reported a positive COVID-19 test result this season.","642":"After a stellar showing against Towson, the Cavaliers (1-1) lost to unranked San Francisco two days later. Tony Bennett and company prepare to play their first game at John Paul Jones Arena on Tuesday against Saint Francis. While that nonconference game is scheduled to be played, the Cavaliers learned of yet another schedule alteration Monday. An in-state foe is pausing practices due to COVID-19, leading to a schedule change. UVa\u2019s schedule is in constant fluctuation this year. A scheduled season opener against Maine was moved after Maine dealt with COVID-19 issues. The loss to San Francisco was originally supposed to be a game with Florida, but the Gators paused activity due to COVID-19. Now, the schedule has changed again. Virginia wasn\u2019t scheduled to play William & Mary until Dec. 12, but the Cavaliers learned before the calendar flipped to December that they won\u2019t face the Tribe in two weeks at JPJ Arena. William & Mary announced Monday that its basketball program would go on a two-week pause due to COVID-19 issues within its program. The Tribe announced one positive test and that all of their players, coaches, trainers and managers would self-quarantine for 14 days. \u201cThe health and safety of our student-athletes, staff and community will always be the priority,\u201d William & Mary interim director of athletics Jeremy Martin said in a statement. \u201cWe will continue to work closely with the university leadership and out medical personnel to ensure we are maintaining the safest possible environment for all involved.\u201d The person who tested positive will self-isolate for a minimum of 10 days, per local health guidelines. The test result knocks out five nonconference games from William & Mary\u2019s schedule. The Tribe were scheduled to play N.C. State on Monday before games with Hampton, George Washington, Norfolk State and UVa. Instead, William & Mary hopes to resume men\u2019s basketball activities on Dec. 14. The postponement leaves Virginia with a schedule opening on Dec. 12. The Cavaliers face Michigan State at home on Dec. 9. A week later, the Wahoos open ACC play at Wake Forest. UVa slips to No. 15 in AP poll Virginia started the year ranked No. 4 in the AP poll. After two games, the Cavaliers sit at No. 15. Virginia destroyed Towson in its season opener, winning by 35 points. Two days later, however, San Francisco upset the Cavaliers 61-60 in \u201cBubbleville\u201d in Connecticut. The loss sparked poll voters to move the Wahoos well down the poll. ACC teams Duke, which is ranked No. 6, and North Carolina, which is ranked No. 14, both come in ahead of the Cavaliers. Interestingly, Virginia Tech comes in at No. 16. The Hokies are a perfect 3-0 and upset Villanova in their second game of the season. The victory also came in \u201cBubbleville,\u201d where the Hokies found tremendous success. Elsewhere in the commonwealth, Richmond sits at No. 19 after an early-season upset win over Kentucky. UVa returns to the court Tuesday when it hosts unranked Saint Francis. After a game against Kent State on Friday, Virginia welcomes No. 8 Michigan State to town. On Dec. 19, the Cavaliers are scheduled to compete against No. 12 Villanova.","643":"The Virginia football team waited until it received its Friday COVID-19 test results before flying to Tallahassee to face Florida State. The Cavaliers were cleared to play. Saturday morning, UVa learned a positive test result within Florida State\u2019s program would lead to a postponement of the scheduled game. While both teams have an open date on Dec. 19, don\u2019t expect the Cavaliers to travel back to Tallahassee this year. \u201cI have no interest in going back to Florida State,\u201d head coach Bronco Mendenhall said Monday. \u201cThat opportunity was there. It\u2019s no longer there. I\u2019m anxious to play Boston College and then Virginia Tech and then hopefully we play well enough to be considered for postseason and we go from there.\u201d Understandably, Mendenhall was frustrated with the outcome. He shared particular displeasure with the ACC\u2019s protocols, which allow teams to travel to Saturday road games without both teams first being cleared to play by Friday test results. Director of athletics Carla Williams also shared her concerns with the ACC, according to Mendenhall. He says Williams and the ACC are in discussions to help create a remedy to the problem. \u201cWhat\u2019s typical right now in the ACC is a lot of teams don\u2019t find out their results until Saturday morning, which is, in my opinion, unacceptable,\u201d Mendenhall said. Despite the disappointing postponement, which now looks like a cancellation, the Cavaliers took the news well. Mendenhall says the players, who are used to games being postponed due to issues with opposing teams, embraced the schedule change. Linebacker Zane Zandier and a few players took advantage of the Florida weather while they waited at their hotel for UVa to make travel arrangements to return home. \u201cWe actually had some time to sit by the pool, and you know, hang out a little bit,\u201d Zandier said. Zandier added that he and a few teammates got a \u201cnice bicep pump in\u201d at the hotel weight room. Offensive lineman Chris Glaser joined Zandier and others by the pool. A few players opted to jump into the pool, doing cannon balls. Glaser decided against those with the pool only being about five feet deep. With the Cavaliers not likely to reschedule the game against Florida State, they turn their attention to the final two games on their schedule. The Wahoos face Boston College on Saturday before traveling to Blacksburg the final week of the season to face Virginia Tech. Even with the disappointment of losing a game, Virginia wants to finish its season strong. Right now, the end of the season shows two games likely to be played. If the Cavaliers post good results down the stretch, they may qualify for a bowl game. If invited, the Cavaliers will certainly consider the invitation, although it\u2019s no guarantee they would accept a spot in a postseason game. \u201cI think that has a lot to do with our players\u2019 mindset and if they really want to play another game,\u201d Mendenhall said. \u201cI would be glad to help them if that\u2019s what they\u2019d like to do.\u201d For Virginia to play in a bowl game, it needs to finish the season strong to earn an invite. From there, the game needs to remain scheduled, as COVID-19 outbreaks nationwide have led some bowl games to opt out of having a game this season. If all of that goes according to plan, Virginia still needs its players to commit to competing in the contest. Uncertainty remains on when UVa\u2019s season will end, but the Cavaliers expect to play Saturday at Boston College. A week later, the schedule shows a matchup with the Hokies. Those two games are the primary focus for Virginia\u2019s players and coaches, as they try to flush the disappointment of what appears to be a canceled game from their minds. \u201cIt is what it is, but definitely there\u2019s some urgency for this game and the game after that to show out, show our best abilities and go 2-0 over the next two weeks,\u201d Glaser said.","644":"The University of Virginia athletics department conducted 651 COVID-19 tests of student-athletes and staff from Nov. 23-29, and four of those tests came back positive. The school shared the testing update Monday morning. Since testing began on July 5, UVa has conducted a total of 12,724 COVID-19 tests with 96 total positives reported. The four people who tested positive for COVID-19 will self-isolate for a minimum of 10 days as they monitor symptoms. Close contacts of the four people who tested positive are asked to self-quarantine for 14 days. The positive test results come after two consecutive weekly periods with zero COVID-19 positives for the athletic department. From Nov. 2-22, UVa athletics reported just one positive COVID-19 test result. The Cavaliers saw that number increase in last week\u2019s testing results. Despite minimal positive COVID-19 tests within its athletic department this month, the virus continues to impact UVa sports. The football team traveled to Tallahassee on Friday night, hoping to play Florida State on Saturday. The game was called off Saturday morning due to a positive COVID-19 test and subsequent contact tracing leaving Florida State with just 44 scholarship players available. It\u2019s the third postponed ACC game for UVa this fall. Elsewhere, the Virginia men\u2019s basketball learned Monday that it won\u2019t play William & Mary on Dec. 12. William & Mary\u2019s men\u2019s basketball program halted team activity for two weeks to quarantine after learning of a positive COVID-19 test within its program. Virginia\u2019s athletic department isn\u2019t immune to the impact of COVID-19 as the pandemic continues to affect the country on a daily basis.","645":"The Virginia football team expected to compete against Florida State in Tallahassee on Saturday night. A positive COVID-19 test within Florida State\u2019s program led to a postponement of the game just hours before kickoff. The Cavaliers flew home Saturday and didn\u2019t learn their game time with Boston College until Sunday night. UVa will host the Eagles on Saturday, with kickoff scheduled for 3:30 p.m. The game will air on regional sports networks. A scheduled game is good news for UVa, and it\u2019s made even better with the Eagles as the foe. Boston College\u2019s football program hasn\u2019t recorded a single positive COVID-19 test all season. Those numbers should give UVa hope that Saturday\u2019s contest can be played as scheduled. \u201cIt\u2019s an exceptional accomplishment,\u201d Virginia head coach Bronco Mendenhall said. \u201cTheir staff and players are to be commended for that. I think it\u2019s remarkable in about every way.\u201d With both sides feeling hopeful about the chances of playing Saturday, Virginia needs to refocus from the postponed game against Florida State and turn its attention toward a solid Boston College team. The Eagles are 6-4 this fall and 5-4 in the ACC. BC lost to North Carolina by just four points earlier this fall and nearly upset Clemson, losing 34-28 after jumping out to a 28-10 lead. Quarterback Phil Jurkovec is particularly impressive for the Eagles, completing 61% of his passes for 2,558 yards, 17 touchdowns and just five interceptions. He suffered a left knee injury last weekend in a win over Louisville, but X-rays on the knee returned promising results, according to BC head coach Jeff Hafley. Assuming Jurkovec plays, he\u2019ll test Virginia\u2019s injured secondary. \u201cThe quarterback is from my area, so I\u2019ve been watching him a little bit,\u201d Virginia linebacker and Pittsburgh native Zane Zandier said. \u201cHe\u2019s been playing pretty well, so it\u2019s been cool to see.\u201d As the Cavaliers turn the page to Boston College, they try to move away from the Florida State postponement. They\u2019ve done well in games following schedule alterations. Virginia beat Duke in its season opener after the scheduled season-opening game against Virginia Tech was postponed to Dec. 12. UVa also beat Louisville after that game was postponed one week from Nov. 7 to Nov. 14. \u201cI think we\u2019re a little more bit more used to it, kind of just seeing how the week looks like once you\u2019re coming off that,\u201d Zandier said. \u201cFrom Saturday to Sunday you just got to flip the switch and realize that it\u2019s over, and you\u2019re just always looking for the next opportunity.\u201d Safeties working back to health UVa\u2019s depth chart still doesn\u2019t list safeties Joey Blount and Brenton Nelson on the two-deep roster this week. The two continue to battle injuries that keep them sidelined. \u201cIt\u2019s pending,\u201d Mendenhall said when asked if either of the two would return this season. \u201cJoey is closer than Brenton at this point, and so we remain hopeful, is the best way that I could put it.\u201d In their place, UVa is expected to start Antonio Clary and D\u2019Angelo Amos. On the bright side, Amos left the Abilene Christian game with an injury, but he was given an extra week to rest with the Florida State game not being played. He\u2019s listed as the starter at free safety, giving the Cavaliers the experienced JMU transfer at one defensive back position. Snowden a Butkus semifinalist Charles Snowden, who suffered a season-ending ankle injury against Abilene Christian, was named a 2020 Butkus Award semifinalist. The award goes to the best linebacker in college football, and Snowden is one of 16 semifinalists. Before suffering his injury, Snowden tallied 44 tackles, including 10 tackles for loss and six sacks. After a slow start to the season, he caught fire in October. Snowden posted a four-sack game against North Carolina in one of the better individual showings of any linebacker this fall. The talented linebacker isn\u2019t sure if he\u2019ll declare for the NFL Draft in the spring or take advantage of the extra year of eligibility granted by the NCAA to return for one final season with the Cavaliers.","646":"On Monday, two days after the Virginia football team\u2019s road game with Florida State was postponed just hours before kickoff due to COVID-19 issues within the Seminoles\u2019 program, head coach Bronco Mendenhall said he had no interest in making a return trip to Tallahassee to make up the game. On Tuesday, the ACC revealed that the Virginia-Florida State game would not be made up this season as it announced several changes to the conference\u2019s football schedule heading into the final few weeks of the regular season. The cancelled matchup with the Seminoles leaves the Wahoos with just two remaining regular season games. Virginia will close out its home schedule on Saturday when it hosts Boston College at 3:30 p.m. at Scott Stadium. The Cavaliers will wrap up the regular season on Dec. 12 in Blacksburg against rival Virginia Tech. The kickoff time and TV designation for the Commonwealth Cup matchup is expected to be announced later this week. Florida State, which has not played a game since Nov. 14 due to COVID-19 issues, will now conclude its season with a home game against Duke on Dec. 12 and a road matchup at Wake Forest on Dec. 19. In other scheduling changes, the ACC announced that Wake Forest, which was scheduled to play Notre Dame on Dec. 12, will instead play at Louisville on that same date. That change means that conference leaders Clemson and Notre Dame will both conclude their regular seasons this weekend. Miami is the other ACC team still in contention for a spot in the ACC Championship Game on Dec. 19 in Charlotte. The Hurricanes are scheduled to face Duke on Saturday and North Carolina on Dec. 12. If Miami does not make the ACC Championship Game, the Hurricanes will host Georgia Tech on Dec. 19. In addition to the schedule alterations, the ACC also announced changes to its COVID-19 testing protocols that are aimed at avoiding last-minute game postponements like that one that happened to Virginia on Saturday. Under the new protocols, each ACC team will be required to have a PCR test administered on Thursday with a result arriving prior to the visiting team traveling to the game locale. The Chief Medical Officers from each team will confirm results and attest that there is every expectation that the game will be played. Under the previous protocols, PCR testing results often were not known until Saturday, which Mendenhall said was \u201cunacceptable.\u201d","647":"The same was true Tuesday at John Paul Jones Arena for the first home game of the season. Tuesday\u2019s action appeared slightly different, however. The Cavaliers made a point to line up in a different formation. In \u201cBubbleville,\u201d the team lined up spaced apart, likely to promote social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic. Tuesday, the team lined up side-by-side, putting their arms on each other as some players decided to kneel while others stood. \u201cObviously people are gonna say what they say, but our shirts say \u2018Unity,\u2019 we\u2019re all unified,\u201d Virginia redshirt senior center Jay Huff said. Virginia wore black warm-up shirts Tuesday with the word \u201cunity\u201d on the front. On the bottom of their game jerseys, \u201cunity\u201d appears again. After the game, a couple players shared their reasons for kneeling or standing. \u201cA lot of us have really strong beliefs about the situation in the country right now with the police brutality and all that,\u201d redshirt freshman forward Kadin Shedrick said. Shedrick was one of the players who opted to kneel Tuesday. He took a knee to protest police brutality and racial injustice in the country. The first few games of this season represent the first time the Cavaliers have taken the court since the death of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and others that have sparked protests against racial injustice across the country. Shedrick also mentioned the \u201cStar-Spangled Banner\u201d having a \u201crough background to it\u201d when discussing his decision to kneel. He encouraged people to look into the full lyrics of the song, which some historians and experts say has racist lines, rather than just the part played at sporting events. Francis Scott Key, the author of the \u201cStar-Spangled Banner,\u201d was a slave-owning lawyer who at times during his life fought against the abolitionist movement. Other times, he offered his legal services to help African-Americans fighting for their freedom. When digging into the history of the national anthem, as Shedrick suggests, it adds a more complicated legacy to the song played at UVa home sporting events. While players like Shedrick kneeled Tuesday, others decided to stand. Huff was among the players who stood. \u201cMe, personally, I didn\u2019t choose to because that\u2019s just what I wanted to do, I wanted to stand, but I feel like guys have every right to kneel and the message that they wanted to get across is one that we all support,\u201d Huff said. \u201cObviously that message is just protesting against injustice.\u201d The visual of some players and coaches standing with others kneeling might cause fans to wonder if the team is divided, but Huff and Shedrick say that\u2019s not an accurate assessment. Both players emphasized that they support each other, regardless of the decision they make during the anthem. That support is a key reason why the group decided to line up differently for Tuesday\u2019s playing of the anthem. While views of each player may differ, the group supports the decisions of their teammates when it comes to expressing their beliefs. They wanted to emphasize that by standing next to each other Tuesday. \u201cThe guys that stand, they\u2019re with us 100%,\u201d Shedrick said. \u201cThe guys that kneel, we\u2019re with the guys that stand 100%. We\u2019re all very unified in what we do, and we all support each other.\u201d","648":"Despite minimal shifting throughout the rankings, the top team made a statement last weekend to tighten its grip on the No. 1 ranking. At the bottom of the poll, our lowest-ranked team made a mistake so perplexing that the squad actually found a way to tighten its grip on the No. 15 ranking. 1. Notre Dame (9-0, 8-0 ACC, No. 1 last week): Notre Dame faced a stiff test last week, traveling to North Carolina to face the Tar Heels and their explosive offensive attack. The Fighting Irish performed well, winning 31-17 to pick up yet another impressive victory. Holding UNC to just 298 yards of offense is a major accomplishment. Scheduling changes mean Notre Dame has clinched a spot in the ACC Championship Game. Up next: vs. Syracuse, Saturday, 2:30 p.m. 2. Clemson (8-1, 7-1 ACC, No. 2 last week): The Tigers took the field this weekend, obliterating Pittsburgh by a final score of 52-17. Trevor Lawrence threw for 403 yards and two touchdowns in his return to action, and the Tigers intercepted Kenny Pickett four times. A Clemson-Notre Dame rematch in the conference title game seems likely. Up next: at Virginia Tech, Saturday, 7:30 p.m. 3. Miami (7-1, 6-1 ACC, No. 3 last week): The Hurricanes weren\u2019t in action last weekend, but they\u2019re hoping to retake the field this weekend against Duke. With just the one loss to Clemson, Miami clings to its spot in the ACC title hunt as it desperately roots for Clemson to lose. Up next: at Duke, Saturday, 8 p.m. 4. North Carolina (6-3, 6-3 ACC, No. 4 last week): Defensive flaws remain the critical concern for North Carolina. The offense faltered at times against Notre Dame as well, making the effort to beat the Fighting Irish all that more difficult. A 31-17 loss to Notre Dame moved the Tar Heels to 6-3 on the season, a somewhat disappointing record given the team\u2019s talent level offensively. Up next: vs. Western Carolina, Saturday, noon 5. North Carolina State (7-3, 6-3 ACC, No. 5 last week): Struggling with Syracuse isn\u2019t a great sign, but the Wolfpack found a way to beat the Orange 36-29 despite trailing for long stretches. The Wolfpack, aided by a weak late-season schedule, have quietly put together an impressive season. Up next: vs. Georgia Tech, Saturday, 4 p.m. 6. Boston College (6-4, 5-4 ACC, No. 7 last week): A solid first season under head coach Jeff Hafley continued Saturday with a win over Louisville. The Eagles threw for 247 yards and two touchdowns while also adding 188 rushing yards and a pair of scores in a 34-27 win over the Cardinals. Up next: at Virginia, Saturday, 3:30 p.m. 7. Wake Forest (4-3, 3-3 ACC, No. 6 last week): The Demon Deacons didn\u2019t play last weekend, and they aren\u2019t scheduled to compete this weekend either. They haven\u2019t played since Nov. 14. There\u2019s hope Wake Forest plays on Dec. 12 against Louisville. Up next: Bye 8. Virginia (4-4, 3-4 ACC, No. 8 last week): UVa\u2019s game against Florida State was postponed on game day due to a positive COVID-19 test within FSU\u2019s program. The Cavaliers were frustrated that the ACC protocols allowed them to travel to Tallahassee before Florida State was cleared to play by Friday test results. While the ACC changed its protocols this week as a result, UVa won\u2019t play Florida State again this season. Up next: vs. Boston College, Saturday, 3:30 p.m. 9. Pittsburgh (5-5, 4-5 ACC, No. 9 last week): Running into an angry Clemson team didn\u2019t end well for Pitt, which lost 52-17. Starting quarterback Kenny Pickett threw four interceptions, and the defense struggled to slow down Trevor Lawrence. Up next: Bye 10. Virginia Tech (4-5, 4-4 ACC, No. 10 last week): A bye week came at an ideal time for a struggling Virginia Tech team. Unfortunately for the Hokies, they return from a week off to host a Clemson team preparing for a College Football Playoff push. Up next: vs. Clemson, Saturday, 7:30 p.m. 11. Georgia Tech (3-5, 3-4 ACC, No. 11 last week): When we get this far down the power poll, we want to see teams make statement wins to ensure they don\u2019t slide to the dreaded 15th spot in the league. The Yellow Jackets did just that, beating Duke 56-33. While Georgia Tech is far from an ACC contender, they\u2019re among the better teams in the bottom third of the ACC. Up next: at N.C. State, Saturday, 4 p.m. 12. Louisville (3-7, 2-7 ACC, No. 12 last week): Another week of games brought with it another disappointing Louisville loss. The Cardinals fell to Boston College 34-27, giving them four one-possession defeats this season. All three of their wins have come by double digits. Up next: Bye 13. Florida State (2-6, 1-6 ACC, No. 13 last week): For the second consecutive week, a game scheduled to be played at Florida State was called off on game day due to COVID-19 concerns. The Seminoles aren\u2019t scheduled to play this week. Up next: Bye 14. Duke (2-7, 1-7 ACC, No. 14 last week): After a 23-point loss to Georgia Tech, a miserable season is scheduled to end this weekend when Duke hosts Miami. Unfortunately, Miami is one of the best teams in the conference, so the misery might last one more Saturday. Up next: vs. Miami, Saturday, 8 p.m. 15. Syracuse (1-9, 1-8 ACC, No. 15 last week): Syracuse played well against N.C. State, nearly pulling off the upset. The Orange led for stretches, but trailed late. Down seven points with no timeouts left, Syracuse took a sack on third-and-goal. With the clock winding down, Syracuse spiked the ball on fourth-and-goal as the clock expired. No play better sums up Syracuse\u2019s season than spiking the ball on fourth down to stop an expired clock. Up next: at Notre Dame, Saturday, 2:30 p.m.","649":"When a team wins a game by 25 points, fans are typically pleased. Coaches, however, always seem to find areas for needed improvement. For Virginia men\u2019s basketball coach Tony Bennett, he wants to see a complete 40-minute effort from his team. While the 15th-ranked Cavaliers beat Saint Francis 76-51 on Tuesday, they were outscored 38-31 in the second half. Bennett was quick to point to that out after the win. \u201cThey outscored us 38-31 in the second half, and I felt we didn\u2019t last or we weren\u2019t persistent enough defensively,\u201d Bennett said. \u201cThere were breakdowns.\u201d Through three games, UVa is averaging 37 points per first half while allowing just 17.7 points. In the second half, UVa\u2019s offense maintains similar scoring numbers, averaging 38 points per half. Defensively, however, the Wahoos are allowing 37.7 points per second half. San Francisco scored 40 points in the second half of its upset over UVa. \u201cWe played really good basketball defensively and offensively in the first half,\u201d Bennett said after the Saint Francis win. \u201cAnd we got on the glass, we touched the paint, scored in the paint and offensive rebounds, so that was good to see \u2026 so I think that was a step in the right direction in the first half. Second half, not so much.\u201d UVa (2-1) hosts Kent State (1-0) on Friday at 6 p.m. The Golden Flashes opened the season against Point Park, an NAIA school. While the competition will be much better against Virginia, Kent State did win its first game 90-41, scoring 50 points in the second half. Kent State was picked in the preseason to finish seventh in the MAC this year. It possesses decent talent at the forward positions. Senior forward Danny Pippen is one of the top players in the MAC, and 6-foot-11 senior Justyn Hamilton snagged 14 rebounds against Point Park. Hamilton is a transfer from Temple. UVa can counter the post play of Kent State with players such as redshirt senior center Jay Huff and power forward Kadin Shedrick. After dealing with an illness in the fall, Shedrick has regained much of the 25 pounds he lost when he was sick. He looked stellar Tuesday, scoring 12 points and adding eight rebounds. \u201cI saw a lot of fight in him [Tuesday] and that\u2019s something we\u2019ve been seeing a lot in practice recently too,\u201d Huff said. \u201cHe\u2019s just been getting a lot of offensive rebounds. His long arms help a lot with that so he\u2019s going to be a big piece moving forward.\u201d The Cavaliers want to put together a 40-minute performance against the mid-major foe, and they\u2019ll do so using a deep rotation. Interestingly, Bennett used two different five-man lineups at times, basically subbing out an entire group to put another group of guys on the floor. \u201cI kind of did the hockey shifts,\u201d Bennett said. \u201cShout out to the Tampa Bay Lightning.\u201d The Lightning won the Stanley Cup in 2019-20, and head coach Jon Cooper credited Virginia\u2019s national title run after losing to UMBC the year prior as inspiration in their championship journey. Adjusting to rotations and determining which groups work best together plays a role in the team\u2019s ability to put together a complete performance. Through three games, point guard Kihei Clark hasn\u2019t been as effective as he was at times last season. He\u2019s turned the ball over seven times through three games, and he only played 15 minutes in the win over Saint Francis. Freshman Reece Beekman played 22 minutes at point guard against the Red Flash, and he\u2019s yet to turn the ball over in 69 minutes of action this season. Beekman\u2019s play earned him the start against Saint Francis, pushing Clark to the bench as the Cavaliers tried out a new starting lineup. \u201cSome guys just have it,\u201d Bennett said. \u201cIt\u2019s the \u2018it,\u2019 the feel thing, and so far he\u2019s shown that. That\u2019s what we liked about him when we recruited him.\u201d As the Wahoos work in new players \u2014 they played their full roster in wins over Towson and Saint Francis \u2014 there will be growing pains. The Cavaliers also played a five-out offensive system in its first two games before running its more traditional blocker-mover offensive sets in the matchup with Saint Francis. Without scrimmages this season due to COVID-19, the new offensive principles coupled with the addition of new players leads to stretches of inconsistency. Bennett wants his team to be sound for a full 40 minutes. Fortunately for Virginia, ample time remains this season to improve and generate better consistency on both ends of the floor. \u201cI think learning to play with everybody is something that we\u2019re going to have to figure out, and I think we\u2019re learning how to do that,\u201d Huff said. \u201cWe have a really young team. We have a lot of young guys that, you know, haven\u2019t necessarily been here as long as an old man like me.\u201d","650":"Saturday will represent an unusual Senior Day for the Virginia football team. Typically, seniors are greeted by thousands upon thousands of screaming fans. Families wait to embrace players on the field as they enter minutes before kickoff. Once the game begins seniors know it\u2019s their last game at Scott Stadium. That won\u2019t be the case this season. COVID-19 restrictions cap attendance at 250 people. Only family members of players and coaches are allowed inside Scott Stadium, which seats 61,500. The atmosphere will be surprisingly quiet on a chilly December afternoon. With the NCAA offering eligibility relief to athletes, some seniors aren\u2019t even sure if Saturday really represents their last time playing in Scott Stadium. \u201cWith this COVID year, the NCAA has granted everybody another year,\u201d offensive coordinator Robert Anae said. \u201cSo it\u2019s Senior Day, but it might not be.\u201d Linebacker Charles Snowden, an NFL prospect, is out for the rest of the season with a broken ankle. He\u2019s could return for one more season at Virginia or he could turn try to land on an NFL roster. Snowden has yet to make a final decision on his future. Zane Zandier, another potential NFL prospect at linebacker, also is among the growing contingent of seniors unsure about what the future holds. \u201cI\u2019m just taking it week by week,\u201d Zandier said. \u201cI think with how this year has gone, kind of just have to focus on the next game and try not to look too far ahead. I\u2019ve had conversations with parents, coaches, wouldn\u2019t say that decision is exactly set in stone yet.\u201d Cornerback De\u2019Vante Cross says he\u2019s leaning toward leaving after this season, but he hasn\u2019t completely made his decision. Cross was a senior last year, and this season represents his redshirt senior year. He celebrated Senior Day a season ago and helped Virginia beat Virginia Tech in the final home game of the season. \u201cIt really doesn\u2019t feel like a Senior Day just because this is my second go around at Senior Day,\u201d Cross said. \u201cLast year it was the Tech game and it was a packed stadium, you\u2019ve got your family on the field and everything. It was just much more exciting than walking out in an empty stadium, but at the same time you know it\u2019s your last game, so you\u2019re still excited about it.\u201d Cross and Zandier echoed similar sentiments, saying they want to win this one even if there\u2019s a chance they return next fall. Head coach Bronco Mendenhall knows he can\u2019t make up for the thousands of fans absent from Scott Stadium. He\u2019s spent time pondering how to create the best experience for the seniors, and while the game-day atmosphere won\u2019t be the same as other seasons, he\u2019s hoping a winning result makes up for the lack of crowd noise. \u201cThe best way to do that is to have them well prepared so they can have success, and that\u2019s what we\u2019ll try to do,\u201d Mendenhall said. As the coaches and players prepare for Saturday\u2019s showdown with Boston College, some of the players can\u2019t help but reminisce about their time at UVa. For Cross, he remembers the nerves when his parents dropped him off in 2016. He recalls the combination of excitement and anxiety about not knowing what might come next. Since then, he\u2019s become an on-field leader with NFL dreams. \u201cI remember walking on campus on July 6, 2016, to now, and it\u2019s been a wild journey,\u201d Cross said. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of sad, but at the same time it\u2019s kind of exciting. You get to move onto the next chapter, whatever that holds.\u201d Cross doesn\u2019t want to leave his teammates, but he knows the day is coming where the senior class embarks on different paths. The experience reminds him of high school, when he savored the final few games and moments, knowing he might not interact with some of his peers much at all as their lives went in different directions. \u201cIt is sad,\u201d Cross said. \u201cIt\u2019s really sad. It\u2019s like dang, I\u2019m gonna miss them, but I know we all gotta move on and branch out and do our different things.\u201d Cross won\u2019t completely rule out one more year at UVa, holding onto some hope that he might have a third senior day for the Wahoos. Zandier also won\u2019t yet utter the words that he plans on leaving. Both want to treat Saturday like it is their last home game in a Virginia uniform, though. Regardless of the jarring silence inside Scott Stadium on game days this fall, they want to make Saturday\u2019s game one to remember. \u201cJust gotta act like it\u2019s the last one because you never know,\u201d Zandier said. \u201cWould hate to have any regrets.\u201d","651":"\u201cThe postponement follows positive tests, subsequent quarantining and contact tracing within the Wake Forest men\u2019s basketball team,\u201d the ACC said in a statement. Wake Forest recently stopped team activities due to COVID-19 issues. It appears the Demon Deacons won\u2019t be ready to compete on Dec. 16. The news leaves Virginia with a sizeable scheduling gap. UVa faces Michigan State on Wednesday at John Paul Jones Arena. The Cavaliers were originally scheduled to host William & Mary on Dec. 12, but the Tribe stopped team activities due to COVID-19 issues within its program. That game is listed as postponed. With the William & Mary game postponed and the Dec. 16 contest at Wake Forest postponed, the Cavaliers currently have a gap from the Wednesday game against Michigan State until Dec. 19. The Wahoos are scheduled to face Villanova at 8 p.m. on Dec. 19 in Madison Square Garden. The Cavaliers may opt to add an opponent to their schedule between those two games, especially given the opening on Dec. 12.","652":"Virginia lost to Miami on Oct. 24, dropping to 1-4 on the season. The defeat extended the Cavaliers\u2019 losing streak to four games. UVa players and coaches kept saying they were better than their record showed. As they turn the page to Virginia Tech week, the record now shows what the Cavaliers are capable of doing when they play at their best. After Saturday\u2019s 43-32 win over Boston College on Senior Day, UVa (5-4, 4-4 ACC) is on a four-game winning streak as it turns its attention to the Hokies. The Cavaliers turned their season around with a late-season surge, and a win over Virginia Tech would guarantee a winning record this fall. \u201cCoach always talks about hard things together and that four-game stretch of losing was extremely difficult just coming into practice and knowing we just came off another loss,\u201d defensive lineman Mandy Alonso said. \u201cTrying to get our minds right to get that win to spark that momentum that we needed to get this season ending how we wanted it to.\u201d With four consecutive victories under its belt, UVa enters its showdown with Virginia Tech playing some of its best football of the season. The string of wins also has the Cavaliers feeling more confident than they did in early October. \u201cWe\u2019re extremely confident,\u201d Alonso said. \u201cComing off the win last year, it just gives us more edge to hold onto the [Commonwealth] Cup and keep the streak in our hands instead of theirs.\u201d There\u2019s good reason for UVa\u2019s confidence. The Cavaliers beat Boston College despite allowing 520 passing yards. A few key turnovers helped on defense, and quarterback Brennan Armstrong became the first quarterback in program history with back-to-back 400-yard performances. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy it\u2019s only his first year,\u201d running back Shane Simpson said of Armstrong. \u201cObviously during the beginning of the year, you could definitely tell there were some jitters here and there, but now he\u2019s settled in really well with us. Everybody\u2019s meshing well.\u201d Armstrong helped guide the Wahoos to a season-high 549 yards in the victory over the Eagles. Honoring Snowden UVa linebacker Charles Snowden served as a leader all season. The NFL prospect was arguably the Cavaliers\u2019 best defensive player when he suffered a season-ending injury against Abilene Christian. While Snowden couldn\u2019t take the field for Senior Day, that didn\u2019t stop the Wahoos from honoring their captain. Simpson decided to wear No. 11 on Saturday to honor the injured linebacker and delivered a dazzling 73-yard kickoff return while wearing the number. \u201cI asked Charles if I could play for him, and he said he loved the idea and then I asked Coach Mendenhall and he approved of it, so I\u2019m thankful for both of them,\u201d Simpson said. After the victory, Snowden broke the rock to celebrate the win. \u201cI didn\u2019t know how to pay tribute to him and thank him any more than allowing him to do that in front of his peers,\u201d Mendenhall said. Mendenhall acknowledged Armstrong\u2019s elite performance at quarterback, but he felt the need to give Snowden the chance to break the rock after the team\u2019s Senior Day win. \u201cI can\u2019t thank Charles enough for his leadership, for his example, for his trust in us, and it just seemed appropriate to give him, as a defensive captain, the last chance in this stadium to do that in front of his peers,\u201d Mendenhall said. Player availability Six UVa players were unavailable for competition due to COVID-19, the program announced before kickoff. It\u2019s unclear how many of those six players tested positive for the virus. Noah Taylor and Jahmeer Carter were among expected starters to miss Saturday\u2019s game. Brenton Nelson remained out with injury. On the bright side for the Cavaliers, safety Joey Blount returned Saturday from injury. He contributed four tackles in his return to action. Wide receiver Lavel Davis Jr. left the game early after taking a big hit on a reception. The defender was ejected for targeting, and Davis Jr. came off the field in pain before going with trainers to the locker room. It\u2019s unclear if some of those injured Cavaliers will be able to take the field next weekend in Blacksburg.","653":"We knew college football would be peculiar in 2020, but not to this extreme: Virginia yielded 520 passing yards to a backup\/former walk-on Saturday and won by 11 points. The Cavaliers defeated Boston College 43-32 at Scott Stadium on an afternoon when their own quarterback made history, impeccably timed history at that. Brennan Armstrong\u2019s 417 yards of total offense (287 passing and 130 rushing) made him the first UVa player to record consecutive games of 400-plus yards and bailed out a defense that, because of injury, transfer and COVID-19 protocol, was without five of its starting front seven linemen and linebackers. Think about that. Shawn Moore never had back-to-back 400-yard outings. Nor did Matt Schaub or, most recently, the ever-dynamic Bryce Perkins. OK, so Armstrong\u2019s initial 400-yard performance came against Abilene Christian. But previous UVa teams also played overmatched opponents. \u201cI just play my style of football,\u201d Armstrong said. \u201cI\u2019ve gotten better through these games. \u2026 It\u2019s just my job to get the ball in the end zone. \u2026 Just put points on the board and that stuff happens.\u201d Armstrong is the first Cavalier to rush for 100-plus yards this season, and his 60-yard scoring sprint early in the third quarter gave UVa (5-4, 4-4 ACC) breathing room at 27-17. Situational quarterback Keytaon Thompson added 86 rushing yards, half of which came on a clinching fourth-quarter touchdown. Boston College has been vulnerable to running quarterbacks this year, most notably Virginia Tech\u2019s Hendon Hooker and Louisville\u2019s Malik Cunningham, and offensive coordinator Robert Anae was wise to exploit that weakness. \u201cThe bottom line is,\u201d Virginia coach Bronco Mendenhall said, \u201cmost conventional defenses aren\u2019t equipped to handle quarterback run because you\u2019re down a number, and unless there\u2019s an adjustment, it\u2019s just very difficult. So not only conceptually a good idea, we [also] happen to have two good players capable of doing that.\u201d The Cavaliers gained 549 yards, their most since 552 against Ohio in 2018, and averaged a stout 8.0 yards per snap. They needed darn near all of that production. Boston College backup Dennis Grosel, subbing for injured starter Phil Jurkovec, passed for 520 yards, matching a school record set originally by Heisman Trophy winner Doug Flutie. That\u2019s also the most passing yards ever allowed by UVa. Grosel threw four touchdown passes and had completions of 20-plus yards to six different receivers. But while the secondary struggled mightily, especially against Zay Flowers and tight end Hunter Long (16 combined catches for 289 yards and three scores), De\u2019Vante Cross, Nick Grant and D\u2019Angelo Amos had interceptions. Moreover, Virginia sacked Grosel four times for minus-35 yards and limited the Eagles (6-5, 5-5) to minus-7 yards rushing overall. \u201cJust enough plays,\u201d Mendenhall said of the defense. The largest was Grant\u2019s third-quarter interception in the end zone, where he outfought Flowers for the ball as they tumbled to the turf. A touchdown there would have put the Eagles in front. Instead, the Cavaliers drove 80 yards on two plays, the last 60 on Armstrong\u2019s scoring jaunt, for a two-score lead. \u201cBrennan Armstrong continues to be exceptional,\u201d Mendenhall said, \u201cand continues to get better and better and better.\u201d Armstrong\u2019s progress coincides with the team\u2019s. Virginia has won four consecutive games, and next Saturday at Virginia Tech will attempt to win five straight for the first time since Chris Long and friends reeled off seven in a row in 2007. Yes, 12 weeks after the state rivals were first scheduled to clash in this reconfigured season \u2014 virus issues among the Hokies scratched that date \u2014 it\u2019s time for the Commonwealth Cup. UVa is seeking to beat Tech in back-to-back years for the first time since 1997 and \u201998. That 36-32 come-from-behind victory in \u201998 \u2014 take a bow, Aaron Brooks and Ahmad Hawkins \u2014 also marks Virginia\u2019s most recent win at Lane Stadium. Only twice in the last 30 years, 2011 and 1991, have the Cavaliers entered the Virginia Tech contest on a four-game run. In \u201991, they crushed the Hokies 38-0. In \u201911, they lost 38-0. Weird, huh? But the entirety of 2020 has been weird. One component that Mendenhall doesn\u2019t consider unusual is UVa\u2019s late-season momentum. Indeed, he foreshadowed it when the Cavaliers gathered for training camp. \u201cThey\u2019re gaining momentum in the pandemic,\u201d Mendenhall said, \u201cregardless of circumstances. \u2026 When they came back [this summer], one of the first things I shared with them was that I believed the longer this goes the stronger we\u2019ll get. \u2026 \u201cI believed that. I knew that. But those words are pretty hollow until you see it.\u201d David Teel reports for the Richmond Times-Dispatch.","654":"Virginia football coach Bronco Mendenhall addressed his team as their losing streak grew. He told them to keep pushing, that results would soon come. \u201cI made the same promise to this team as I made way back when I became the head coach \u2014 and that was that it wasn\u2019t a matter of if, it was when,\u201d Mendenhall said. \u201cThat this team, this season that we would start to have success and that was during that hard stretch, and I believe that. I knew that, but those words are pretty hollow until you see it.\u201d UVa (5-4, 4-4 ACC) saw results again Saturday, beating Boston College 43-32 behind an impressive offensive effort. The victory was the Cavaliers\u2019 fourth in a row. Earlier this fall, Virginia looked like it was headed for its first losing regular-season record since going 2-10 in Mendenhall\u2019s first season. Instead, the Cavaliers rallied after their 1-4 start behind stellar play from starting quarterback Brennan Armstrong. UVa posted 549 total yards of offense against Boston College, giving them consecutive 500-yard performances for the first time since 2014. Armstrong became the first UVa quarterback to ever post consecutive 400-yard performances. Over UVa\u2019s four-game winning streak, Armstrong is completing 65.3% of his passes for 270 yards per game. He\u2019s tossed nine touchdowns to three interceptions, and he\u2019s also adding an average of 77 rushing yards per game. He ran for an impressive 130 yards in the win over Boston College. Armstrong\u2019s improved play comes as Virginia\u2019s defense uses creative measures to find success. Tommy Christ, an offensive lineman who played on the defensive line early in his career, switched back to defensive line this week due to a lack of available defensive linemen. Linebackers Charles Snowden and Noah Taylor were both out Saturday, and Snowden is out for the season with a broken ankle. At times, the Cavaliers leaned on their backup linebackers and would run schemes with only one or two defensive linemen on the field. The group found ways to make enough plays against the Eagles to let Armstrong and company pave the way to a win. \u201cOur defense got a little banged up two weeks ago, and what else can you do?\u201d Armstrong said. \u201cWe just keep rolling through it. The season has been hard; everything\u2019s been tough mentally, physically, so just keep rolling.\u201d As the season progresses and the COVID-19 pandemic gets worse, the Cavaliers somehow seem to improve weekly. Despite rising COVID-19 case counts nationally, UVa has kept its virus numbers low. The Cavaliers were without six players due to COVID-19 protocols Saturday, which comes as an increase after multiple weeks without any COVID-19 issues. They\u2019ve still yet to be the cause of a postponed or canceled game, having more than enough players available each week to safely compete. Remaining focused through a losing streak during a pandemic wasn\u2019t easy, but the Cavaliers stayed the course. They believed wins would come, and they have. Mendenhall told the team throughout the offseason that their culture would allow them to find success the longer the season went. His remarks proved true. \u201cHe said it during quarantine when we\u2019re like having Zoom calls that the longer this goes, the better we will be, the stronger we\u2019ll get,\u201d defensive lineman Mandy Alonso said. \u201cSeeing this team, it\u2019s clear that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re doing.\u201d UVa is guaranteed one more game this season. Mendenhall\u2019s group travels to Blacksburg on Saturday to face Virginia Tech. The Wahoos find themselves on a four-game winning streak, while the Hokies have lost four games in a row. After a rough start to the season, the Cavaliers never wavered in their belief that things would turn around. They stayed focused, followed COVID-19 protocols and started to win. \u201cEverything that we do in our program, my passion is to prepare them for their lives and for the world, and it\u2019s so easy to stop when things get hard,\u201d Mendenhall said. \u201cIt\u2019s easier to opt out than opt in. They have just opted in and then they\u2019ve stayed in.\u201d","655":"As the Virginia football team\u2019s regular season nears its end, there\u2019s a chance Saturday\u2019s game in Blacksburg is the Cavaliers' final contest this season. Given its recent four-game winning streak, UVa (5-4, 4-4 ACC) is positioned to receive an invitation for a postseason bowl game, but the Cavaliers may elect to decline a bowl invitation regardless of what happens Saturday against Virginia Tech. Head coach Bronco Mendenhall, assistant coaches and players want to weigh their options, knowing the sacrifice needed to play future games during the pandemic. \u201cEveryone in college football has been on their campuses for a long time, and if you think now about not just this game or the games that are coming up for these teams, postseason announcements won\u2019t come until the 20th,\u201d Mendenhall said. \u201cGames will happen after that, so players potentially have a chance to be on Grounds without school, without other students and away from their families for Christmas to avoid the quarantine when you have to come back.\u201d Essentially, if UVa wants to play a bowl game in late December, the Cavaliers need to be in Charlottesville to practice and follow strict COVID-19 protocols, including frequent testing. Playing in a bowl game could potentially keep the Wahoos from visiting family between Dec. 12 and the date of the bowl game. Mendenhall wants to make sure he puts his team in a position where the sacrifice of playing is worth the reward. UVa\u2019s head coach determined playing an ACC game on Dec. 19 was unnecessary for the program. The Cavaliers potentially could have rescheduled the team\u2019s postponed game against Florida State for that date. Instead, the Wahoos end their regular season with Virginia Tech and Florida State added Wake Forest on Dec. 19. The Cavaliers won\u2019t add any opponent to the schedule on Dec. 19. \u201cWe were actually asked by the ACC to play on the 19th and said no,\u201d Mendenhall said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it added value to our program or the team we would have been playing in whatever schedule changes we were asked to do. I\u2019m mindful of our program, our players and doing the very best I can for them and having Boston College at home and then Virginia Tech on the road as the last two regular-season games, that\u2019s the appropriate finish for our team.\u201d When opting not to play on Dec. 19, Mendenhall\u2019s focus was on the mental health of his players. They\u2019ve done well to be ready to play every game this fall, keeping COVID-19 case counts low despite three opponents struggling with the virus and needing to postpone games with Virginia. \u201cA lot of times, it\u2019s more than inventory, it\u2019s more just than TV, and sometimes coaches and administrations have to speak up and look after the well-being of student-athletes who have been here, I think this is 23 weeks straight after a 17-week break of not seeing their coaches, so it\u2019s been long,\u201d Mendenhall said. After a long season and increased social distancing practices never needed in previous seasons, some Cavaliers are ready for a break. \u201cI would not mind spending Christmas with my family,\u201d Virginia safety Joey Blount said. When making the decision about possibly competing in a bowl game, the team needs to weigh the enjoyment of playing one final time this season with the desire to spend the holidays with family members. Blount clarified that he doesn\u2019t speak for everyone on the team and others may feel differently about competing in the postseason, especially given UVa\u2019s annual goal of making a bowl game. \u201cI would think a bowl game, it\u2019s a high honor to take,\u201d Blount added. For the senior, however, he\u2019s more inclined to spend the holidays at home instead of preparing for a final football game. \u201cMe being home for the holidays is definitely something I\u2019m leaning more toward,\u201d Blount said.","656":"The University of Virginia athletic department administered 929 COVID-19 tests from Nov. 30 through Dec. 6. Seven of those tests were positive, the school announced on Monday. UVa began testing on student-athletes and staff on July 5, and it has conducted 13,653 tests since early July. Of those tests, 103 have come back positive. The student-athletes and staff members who tested positive in the latest round of testing will self-isolate for a minimum of 10 days as they monitor symptoms. Those who are deemed close contacts to the individuals who test positive are asked to self-quarantine for two weeks. The positive test results in recent weeks have impacted the Virginia football program. The Cavaliers were without six players this past weekend against Boston College. It\u2019s unclear how many of those players tested positive and how many were close contacts who needed to quarantine. Even with a handful of players out Saturday, the Cavaliers were able to compete against the Eagles due to most of their roster being available for competition. The UVa football team\u2019s regular season is scheduled to end Saturday at Virginia Tech. Men\u2019s and women\u2019s basketball join football as other Virginia athletic programs currently competing against other schools. The swimming and diving team wrapped up its fall schedule on Nov. 21. Men\u2019s basketball is four games into its season, while the women\u2019s team has competed three times. The women\u2019s basketball team did cancel its Sunday game due to injury issues. The Cavaliers only had six players available for competition. They hope to return to action Thursday against Clemson.","657":"It\u2019s rivalry week. While the initial ACC football schedule pinned Virginia against Virginia Tech to open the season, a postponement due to COVID-19 moved the matchup to Dec. 12. The two rivals meet Saturday at 8 p.m. in the regular-season finale. \u201cThe culmination of the season, I think it\u2019s playing out just as it should with Virginia playing Virginia Tech last game of the season in Blacksburg,\u201d senior safety Joey Blount said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a hell of a game for sure.\u201d For the first time since the 2004 showdown, UVa enters the game with ownership of the Commonwealth Cup. The Cavaliers beat the Hokies 39-30 last fall to break a 15-game losing streak in the series. The Cavaliers travel to Blacksburg confident. With Saturday\u2019s win over Boston College, Virginia has won four games in a row. Virginia Tech, on the other hand, lost to Clemson on Saturday, its fourth consecutive defeat. The teams find themselves heading in opposite directions. \u201cSometimes the perception of what direction the team is going has a lot to do with just the schedule and how that plays out,\u201d Virginia coach Bronco Mendenhall said. For UVa, its slow start coincided with games against Clemson, N.C. State and Miami. All three programs have at least eight wins this fall. For Virginia Tech, its recent losing streak came against quality opponents in Liberty, Miami and Clemson. Strength of schedule certainly plays a role in outcomes, but the Hokies have also been at less than their best in recent games. Clemson beat Virginia Tech 45-10 after the Hokies lost to Pittsburgh 47-14 two weeks prior. They\u2019re struggling. Mendenhall still respects the challenge of Virginia Tech\u2019s playing style and rushing attack, which present a test this weekend. Head coach Justin Fuente\u2019s team leads the ACC in rushing yards per game with 238.9 per contest. \u201cMuch like every year under Coach Fuente, Virginia Tech is hard-nosed, they\u2019re run first, they\u2019re physical, they\u2019re tough, they play aggressively,\u201d Mendenhall said. Khalil Herbert averages 7.6 yards per carry, and he\u2019s one of just three ACC running backs to exceed 100 rushing yards per game this fall. Stopping the Hokies begins by stopping the run. Breaking the road losing streak Last season\u2019s victory over Virginia Tech at Scott Stadium broke UVa\u2019s 15-game losing streak to the Hokies. Unfortunately for UVa, it still hasn\u2019t won at Virginia Tech since 1998. The Cavaliers hope to end that road losing streak this weekend. Virginia has come close to winning in recent trips to Blacksburg. The Cavaliers fell 34-31 in overtime of their most recent visit to Virginia Tech, storming back from a 14-0 deficit only to blow a fourth-quarter lead. In 2014, Virginia lost 24-20 on its trip to Virginia Tech, and the Cavaliers were close in 2008 as well, falling 17-14. \u201cIt\u2019s a big deal,\u201d Blount said. \u201cThe last time I was at Blacksburg it was an experience I won\u2019t forget. The crowd was intense.\u201d While the crowd won\u2019t be packed due to COVID-19 health protocols that limit attendance, the game still matters to both sides. Picking up a road win would be special for the Wahoos, who have been through a long and arduous season to reach this Dec. 12 game. \u201cTo finish it out with a potential win in Blacksburg, would just add to the story,\u201d Blount said. Injury updates Blount, who returned from injury Saturday against Boston College, is expected to suit up again this weekend. He says he rushed back from a leg injury earlier this season. After playing against Wake Forest, Blount didn\u2019t take the field until Saturday\u2019s win over Boston College. He feels healthy now and ready to finish the season. Blount, a senior, added Monday that he hasn\u2019t made a decision about whether this year will be his last or if he\u2019ll return to UVa and use the extra eligibility offered to players by the NCAA. Mendenhall didn\u2019t give any additional status updates to players such as linebacker Noah Taylor or defensive lineman Jahmeer Carter. Both players missed Saturday\u2019s victory over Boston College. Cavaliers honored Ryan Swoboda was named the ACC Offensive Lineman of the Week for his performance against Boston College. According to a UVa release, Swoboda received a run-blocking grade of 86 against the Eagles. He also excelled as a pass blocker, earning a grade of 96 out of 100. Swoboda helped pave the way for a tremendous offensive showing on Saturday. Virginia racked up over 500 yards of total offense for the second consecutive week, surpassing 200 rushing yards in the victory. In the coaching world, inside linebackers coach Shane Hunter was selected to the American Football Coaches Association 35 under 35 Coaches Leadership Institute. The rising star in the coaching professional will have a chance to participate in the one-day institute with some of the other brightest young minds in the college football coaching profession.","658":"Justin Taylor grew up watching Malcolm Brogdon, Joe Harris and Justin Anderson bring fans to their feet at John Paul Jones Arena as members of the University of Virginia men\u2019s basketball team. The St. Anne\u2019s-Belfield junior guard will have the opportunity to join his hometown program after recently receiving a scholarship offer from UVa coach Tony Bennett. \u201cIt means a lot to get an offer from the university in my hometown,\u201d Taylor said, \u201cbut the fact that the program has had so much success under Coach Bennett and the fact they recently won a national championship makes it that much more special.\u201d The 6-foot-6 swingman has become a coveted commodity and has more than a dozen offers from Power 5 conference schools. Taylor enters his junior year at STAB as the No. 49th ranked prospect nationally in the Class of 2022 by 247Sports after a couple of impressive high school seasons. \u201cI try not to pay too much mind to it and just focus on getting better,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cIt\u2019s, for sure, a huge honor though and to be recognized as one of those top players in the country in my class and honestly motivates me to try and prove that I can be ranked higher.\u201d As a sophomore, Taylor averaged 15.4 points, 5.3 rebounds and 2.8 assists a game to lead STAB to a share of the Virginia Prep League title and a berth in the VISAA Division I state tournament. That production has garnered him offers from numerous Division I programs, particularly in the past few months. Since June 15, he has received offers from more than 10 programs, including Indiana, Virginia Tech, Syracuse, Butler, N.C. State, Georgetown, Richmond, Bryant, Saint Joseph\u2019s and Maryland. Taylor credits his offseason work, despite the challenges created COVID-19 pandemic, for the increased notoriety. He played in a number of showcase AAU tournaments which helped his stock grow. In October, he was invited to the Coach Wooten Camp in Texas, where he showcased his talent against the Top 75 juniors and seniors in the country. \u201cI think this summer I was able to expand my game a lot more,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the weight room I worked a lot on my athleticism and quickness to become a better defender and on the court, I worked on being able to score the ball on all three levels and using my strength to finish at the rim.\u201d The UVa offer did not come not out of the blue. Taylor said Bennett and associate coach Jason Williford attended several of his games last year so he knew he was on their radar. With the new NCAA regulations allowing coaches to reach out to him during the summer, Taylor\u2019s recruitment started to ramp up. \u201cHonestly, timing wise, it was a little unexpected,\u201d he said. \u201cThe impression I got from talking to Coach Bennett and his staff this summer was that I would be one of the first to get an offer in my class, but they wanted to wait on decisions from a couple of guys in the 2021 class, but Coach Bennett believes that now was the right time.\u201d The STAB product said he was excited to get the call. \u201cI was actually waiting in the parking lot for a to-go order when he called and offered,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cIt was really just pure excitement.\u201d Growing up in Charlottesville, Taylor said he\u2019s very familiar with UVa\u2019s program and its style of play. \u201cI feel like Coach Bennett does a really good job recruiting guys who fit into his system,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cEspecially with the blocker-mover offense they run, using pin down and screens, it suits players like me who can shoot and score the ball. I\u2019ve definitely seen guys I have been compared to like Joe Harris and Kyle Guy have success in Coach Bennett\u2019s system, so I do think my game and style of play translates well to the UVa program.\u201d Two years ago, like many Charlottesville residents, Taylor was glued to the television during UVa\u2019s run to the national championship. \u201cGrowing up, I really liked watching guys like Joe Harris, Malcolm Brogdon and Justin Anderson and then of course the national championship run with Ty [Jerome], Kyle and De\u2019Andre [Hunter] was special to watch,\u201d he said. \u201cNow that I\u2019ve grown up and gotten to know some of the guys on the team, it\u2019s been fun to watch them and see how I could fit into the playing style.\u201d Taylor said that the recruiting process has been exciting, but much different than he had anticipated because of COVID-19. The pandemic hasn\u2019t allowed him to take official visits to programs, but he\u2019s hopeful things will open up in the near future to allow him to pursue all of his options. \u201cAs of right now, I haven\u2019t made any cuts to my list and I just want to equally evaluate each school who is showing me high interest,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cI think I\u2019d like to see where I\u2019m at with things at the start of summer and possibly start to narrow down my list then. As far as making a final decision on where I want to go to college, I definitely want to take my time with it all and see where I am at with things this summer. I could see myself making a decision before my senior season.\u201d For Taylor, his main focus is on preparing for the upcoming season and his goals are high, both individually and team-wise. His top priority is leading the Saints to a Prep League title and a state championship in his final two seasons. Individually, he\u2019s like to garner Conference Player of the Year and earn all-state honors. \u201cI\u2019m super ready for the possible start of this high school season,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve started team workouts now and seeing how good we can be having played in these fall leagues adds that much more excitement for the season. Getting the UVa offer definitely adds that much more of a target on my back, which means I\u2019ll just need to prove myself more and more each time we play.\u201d","659":"The talented siblings used to play together at Marquette, but opted to transfer following the 2018-19 season. Originally, they expected to transfer to the same spot, but Sam fell in love with Virginia and Joey created a bond with Michigan State. They spent the 2019-20 season redshirting, simulating opposing stars in practice. Once the season was cut short, they returned home to Wisconsin and went to work together. \u201cDefinitely played a lot of one-and-one and pickup, stuff like that,\u201d Sam, a redshirt senior, said in November. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty rare to have a household with two high-major Division I basketball players in it, so I think having each other was perfect and it gave us kind of a step up maybe over others who didn\u2019t have that opportunity.\u201d Despite years of competing in driveways, practices and pickup games, Sam and Joey Hauser have never met as opponents in a competitive game. That changes Wednesday night. No. 18 UVa and Sam Hauser welcome No. 4 Michigan State and Joey Hauser into John Paul Jones Arena at 9:15 p.m. for a highly anticipated showdown between power programs and elite siblings. \u201cIt\u2019s gonna be a really fun opportunity to see him,\u201d Joey, a redshirt sophomore, said Sunday night. \u201cHopefully my family is able to attend the game. It\u2019s gonna be awesome. Obviously two really well-respected programs, it doesn\u2019t get much better than Michigan State and Virginia, so I think that makes it even better.\u201d The matchup between Virginia and Michigan State puts two elite foes against each other, and the Hauser brothers enter the game playing tremendous basketball. Sam leads UVa in scoring at 14.5 points per game, and he\u2019s tied for the team lead with 6.8 rebounds per contest. He\u2019s shooting 44% on 3-point shots, making seven 3-pointers through four games. Hauser knocked down a clutch 3-pointer late in Virginia\u2019s overtime win over Kent State, helping seal the victory for the Wahoos. \u201cThe three he made was huge, and we needed that,\u201d head coach Tony Bennett said. \u201cHe has that ability. We played him some at the three, the four. You have to allow him to get those shots and take them with confidence and that was huge.\u201d Despite quality play on the offensive end, Hauser has made a few defensive mistakes in his first season playing the Pack Line defense, and he\u2019s still acclimating himself to game competition after a year on the sidelines. \u201cIt is almost a little bit of water in the face,\u201d Bennett said of Hauser adjusting to competition. Joey Hauser also boasts impressive numbers. He leads Michigan State in scoring, averaging 14 points per game. He also leads the team in rebounds per game, snatching an average of 10 per outing. In Michigan State\u2019s latest win, Hauser scored a career-high 24 points in 27 minutes on the court. He scored 15 of those points in the second half, burying five shots from 3-point range. Michigan State head coach Tom Izzo challenged Hauser after the team\u2019s close win over Detroit Mercy the game prior, wanting more from the player who was inconsistent shooting and not playing his best defensively despite decent stats through four games. The 24-point outing against Western Michigan looked like Joey Hauser closer to his best. \u201cI wanted to see how he would handle it,\u201d Izzo said of challenging Hauser. \u201cAnd man, he handled it good, and he even had a sore knee today, and I thought just played his tail off and what really impressed me was that second half because he wasn\u2019t very good defensively first half either. He was really good in the second half.\u201d Both players are still adjusting to life at a new school, but even with the bumps along the way and room to improve, they both lead their respective programs in scoring. They\u2019re both elite rebounders with silky smooth shooting strokes. Heading into the top-20 matchup, Sam and Joey tried to downplay the importance of facing off. \u201cI don\u2019t want to make it about me and my brother because we\u2019re playing Virginia,\u201d Joey said. \u201cWe\u2019re not going down there to play the Joey Hauser-Sam Hauser game. It\u2019s Virginia vs. Michigan State, and that\u2019s what I want it to be about.\u201d At the same time, the two siblings and former college teammates can\u2019t deny that seeing each other on the court will be fun. Competing in a top-20 matchup on ESPN as the leading scorers entering the game only makes the showdown more enjoyable. \u201cI\u2019m extremely excited about it,\u201d Joey admitted.","660":"Virginia and Michigan State enter Wednesday\u2019s ACC\/Big Ten Challenge with drastically different early-season resumes. No. 4 Michigan State comes into the game, which tips off at 9:15 p.m. on ESPN, undefeated. The Spartans (5-0) own two wins over ACC schools, beating Notre Dame and Duke in consecutive games. MSU struggled to put away Detroit Mercy recently, but rallied late to win by seven points. Three of the Spartans\u2019 wins are by double-digits, including a 79-61 triumph over Western Michigan their last time out. On the other side, the Cavaliers (3-1) were upset by San Francisco in their second game of the season and needed overtime to survive an upset scare from Kent State the last time they took the floor. Virginia entered the year No. 4 in the AP poll, but it has since slid to No. 18. \u201cWe\u2019ve just got to keep working and keep improving and chipping away,\u201d head coach Tony Bennett said after beating Kent State. \u201cThe message after the game was \u2013 I said, here\u2019s the line of maximum effort, what you think it is. And for the most part, there\u2019s a line above it about being uncomfortable that we have to somehow, as a group, find a way to get to, especially defensively and all lay it on the line for each other.\u201d In wins over Towson and Saint Francis, the Wahoos looked dominant, knocking down shots and moving the ball well. In the games against San Francisco and Kent State, the Cavaliers looked lethargic on both ends for stretches. \u201cCoach Bennett said after the game: We think we\u2019re playing at our max effort, but there\u2019s [another] level that we have to get to in order to reach the next level of play,\u201d junior guard Kihei Clark said. \u201cSo, especially against Michigan State, we\u2019re definitely going to have to up our effort a lot more.\u201d A lack of energy won\u2019t cut it against a loaded Michigan State roster. Head coach Tom Izzo is one of the best in the business, and he\u2019s working with a talented crew. Sam Hauser\u2019s brother, Joey, leads Michigan State in scoring at 14 points per game. Six Spartans average at least six points per game this season. Rocket Watts is a dynamic guard for Michigan State. He\u2019s tallied about four assists per game while also scoring 13.6 points per contest. Perhaps Michigan State\u2019s best player, however, is Aaron Henry. Henry, a 6-foot-6 forward, does it all. He scores 11.6 points per game to go with 6.2 rebounds. He also leads the team with 26 assists through five games. Henry has started the year in a shooting slump despite posting decent numbers in nearly every statistical category. He is shooting just 1-for-12 from 3-point range this season. Defensively, he\u2019s a menace. Henry leads the team with nine steals and ranks second on the team with 10 blocks. Much like UVa, Michigan State is deep. That depth showed in its latest game, a win over Western Michigan. \u201cWe got back to moving the ball better, that was a bright spot,\u201d Izzo said. \u201cWe had 28 assists on 32 baskets, and I thought we had some great passes in there.\u201d Four Spartans tallied at least four assists in the victory. Virginia, which has rolled out a bunch of different rotations this season, needs consistent play from whoever takes the court Wednesday to beat its top-5 foe. The Cavaliers do have one area where they can expose the Spartans: the low post. Six Spartans average at least 20 minutes per game, and the tallest of the group stands at 6-8. Marcus Bingham Jr., a junior averaging 12.6 minutes per game, is the only player on the team that stands 6-10 or taller. Bingham Jr. checks in at 6-11. Titus Wright, Western Michigan\u2019s 6-8, 250-pound center, bullied the Spartans down low. He scored 16 points on 7-of-11 shooting and added 10 rebounds in the loss to MSU. \u201cI mean, right now that\u2019s a weakness for us,\u201d Izzo said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have great size.\u201d Izzo also added that drills that improve physical play were limited over the summer and fall due to COVID-19 guidelines and the need to remain healthy. \u201cWe need more practice time,\u201d Izzo added. That leaves opportunity for UVa\u2019s long, strong lineup to succeed. Jay Huff, the Cavaliers\u2019 7-foot center, leads Virginia in shooting percentage, making 18 of 26 shots this season. He averages 6.8 rebounds per game and has shown the ability to score efficiently in the low post. Kadin Shedrick, a redshirt freshman, looks good after recovering from an illness this fall. He\u2019s played limited minutes, but he\u2019s scored 14 points in his 42 minutes on the floor and boasts elite length and height. Francisco Caffaro also possesses talent at the center spot, but he\u2019s only played nine minutes this season. Caffaro\u2019s physical presence in the post could be a weapon if Bennett opts to use him. The only concern might be his defensive ability against a smaller, quicker foe. Even UVa\u2019s wing players \u2014 including Sam Hauser and Trey Murphy III \u2014 could find themselves with a height and length advantage against Michigan State\u2019s roster. Hauser has been efficient on 2-point shots, making 17 of his 25 attempts. For a team that wasn\u2019t pleased with its intensity and rebounding against Kent State, there\u2019s opportunity to control the glass and win by being more physical and engaged than the Spartans. Western Michigan added 15 second-chance points against Michigan State, winning that statistical category 15-6. \u201cI think we need to get more of that fiery edge more consistently because I think that feeds into our energy, not only on the court, but even on the bench,\u201d Hauser said. \u201cI think that type of energy just feeds into your play and it helps you play harder.\u201d If the Cavaliers bring consistent intensity and pull out a win, they\u2019ll add an impressive line to their early-season resume.","661":"The game will air on the ACC Network. William & Mary received a positive COVID-19 test result on Nov. 29 and planned on pausing team activities for two weeks. Recent changes in CDC guidance allowed the Tribe to return from quarantine earlier than originally anticipated. The program\u2019s Tier 1 personnel, which are made up of players, coaches, trainers and managers, were tested for COVID-19 on Dec. 4 and Dec. 6. All test results came back negative. This allowed the Tribe, with approval from the Virginia Department of Health, to return to team activities Tuesday. As a result, they will travel to Charlottesville for a game Sunday evening. \u201cI want to thank our entire William & Mary athletics community, as countless staffers went above and beyond to ensure all the needs of our student-athletes were met during their time in quarantine,\u201d head coach Dane Fischer said in a statement. \u201cOur team is excited to get back on the court and represent William & Mary.\u201d The game against UVa\u2019s will represent William & Mary\u2019s first competitive action since a Nov. 28 loss to Old Dominion. UVa faces Michigan State on Wednesday before hosting the Tribe on Dec. 13.","662":"Wednesday's ACC\/Big Ten Challenge matchup between Virginia and Michigan State has been postponed, UVa announced late Tuesday night. The postponement comes due to COVID-19 issues within UVa\u2019s program. The Cavaliers were scheduled to face the Spartans on Wednesday night at 9:15 p.m. on ESPN. Instead, the two nationally ranked teams may attempt to find a date later this season to compete. The matchup was highly anticipated. The Cavaliers were set to enter the game as the nation\u2019s No. 18 team and the reigning national champions. Michigan State entered the matchup undefeated and ranked fourth nationally. It\u2019s unclear just how long the Cavaliers might be off the court due to the COVID-19 issues. They\u2019re scheduled to compete Sunday against William & Mary, which just returned to practice activity after a break due to COVID-19 issues of its own. UVa, which did not offer specifics on its COVID-19 issues, said late Tuesday night that the status of that game is \u201cto be determined.\u201d Typically, people who test positive for COVID-19 must self-isolate for a minimum of 10 days and close contacts of those people who test positive must quarantine for 14 days. Recent changes in CDC guidance, however, allowed William & Mary to return from quarantine in roughly a week. Multiple rounds of negative test results allowed the Tribe to return to team activity following a week of quarantine. A minor outbreak or contact tracing issues could lead to a short break for the Cavaliers. More widespread issues could lead to multiple postponed games for UVa.","663":"Once again, the ACC power poll remains largely stagnant as bottom dwellers struggle to pull the upsets needed to rise in the rankings. Virginia, however, continues its climb. Despite minimal shifting in the poll, this weekend\u2019s games present a few exciting matchups. Miami hosts North Carolina in a game that could result in a shootout between elite quarterbacks. In Blacksburg, Virginia Tech hosts UVa in the Commonwealth Clash, giving ACC fans a dose of rivalry action this weekend. 1. Notre Dame (10-0, 9-0 ACC, No. 1 last week): The Fighting Irish trailed Syracuse early in the second quarter, but they scored three touchdowns in the final four minutes of the second quarter to take a 24-7 lead into halftime. Syracuse never truly threatened Notre Dame, which went on to win 45-21. Ian Book three threw touchdown passes for the ACC\u2019s only undefeated team. Up next: Bye 2. Clemson (9-1, 8-1 ACC, No. 2 last week): Trevor Lawrence and company looked average in the first half of their 45-10 win over Virginia Tech, but the Tigers outscored the Hokies 28-0 in the final 30 minutes for an easy victory. Much like Notre Dame, Clemson is off this week before competing in the ACC Championship Game on Dec. 19. Up next: Bye 3. Miami (8-1, 7-1 ACC, No. 3 last week): After a long, COVID-19 related layoff, the Hurricanes returned to the field Saturday and demolished Duke 48-0. Quarterback D\u2019Eriq King finished the game with just under 300 total yards and four touchdowns. Miami\u2019s defense held the Blue Devils to fewer than 200 yards of total offense. Up next: vs. North Carolina, Saturday, 3:30 p.m. 4. North Carolina (7-3, 6-3 ACC, No. 4 last week): Unsurprisingly, UNC won easily against Western Carolina. The final score showed a 49-9 win, but the Tar Heels were up 42-3 at halftime of the blowout victory. This week\u2019s opponent packs more of a punch. Up next: at Miami, Saturday, 3:30 p.m. 5. North Carolina State (8-3, 7-3 ACC, No. 5 last week): The Wolfpack opened up a 3-0 lead through a quarter of play, and they never trailed in their 23-13 win over Georgia Tech. Quarterback Bailey Hoffman threw for over 300 yards in the victory, and N.C. State\u2019s defense kept the Yellow Jackets in check. The great regular season for the Wolfpack ended with a victory. Up next: Bye 6. Virginia (5-4, 4-4 ACC, No. 8 last week): Bronco Mendenhall\u2019s team allowed a whopping 520 passing yards to Boston College, but quarterback Brennan Armstrong put together another strong showing for the Wahoos. UVa beat BC 43-32 behind 500 yards of total offense and a few key defensive plays in timely moments. The Cavaliers enter this week\u2019s rivalry game filled with confidence. Up next: at Virginia Tech, Saturday, 8 p.m. 7. Boston College (6-5, 5-5 ACC, No. 6 last week): Backup quarterback Dennis Grosel stepped up, throwing for 520 yards in place of injured starter Phil Jurkovec. Unfortunately for the Eagles, the defense struggled to stop UVa\u2019s offense, and Grosel tossed three costly interceptions in a 43-32 loss. Regardless, it\u2019s been a good season from Boston College. Up next: Bye 8. Wake Forest (4-3, 3-3 ACC, No. 7 last week): It\u2019s hard to hold a spot in the ACC Power Poll without playing, and we haven\u2019t seen Wake Forest play a football game since a 59-53 loss to North Carolina on Nov. 14. That\u2019s supposed to change this weekend, and a win could easily move the Demon Deacons back into the top half of the league. Up next: at Louisville, Saturday, noon 9. Pittsburgh (5-5, 4-5 ACC, No. 9 last week): The Panthers were off last weekend, but they return for a Thursday night game against Georgia Tech. It\u2019s a great chance for Pitt to finish the season with a winning record. Up next: at Georgia Tech, Thursday, 7 p.m. 10. Virginia Tech (4-6, 4-5 ACC, No. 10 last week): Justin Fuente\u2019s team was competitive in the first half against Clemson. The wheels fell off in the second half, and the Hokies lost 45-10. For those counting at home, that\u2019s four consecutive losses for Virginia Tech. Up next: vs. Virginia, Saturday, 8 p.m. 11. Georgia Tech (3-6, 3-5 ACC, No. 11 last week): Beating N.C. State was going to be a challenge, and the Yellow Jackets couldn\u2019t quite get it done Saturday. Regardless, the 23-13 defeat was fairly competitive, and the program looks better than it did a season ago. Baby steps. Up next: vs. Pittsburgh, Thursday, 7 p.m. 12. Louisville (3-7, 2-7 ACC, No. 12 last week): Head coach Scott Satterfield could use a PR lesson. The Louisville coach talked to South Carolina about its job opening and made a few remarks earlier this week about players needing to be \u201call in,\u201d while coaches have families to consider when thinking about switching jobs. Several players did voice support for the coach over social media, but the program would certainly rather make headlines with on-field wins. Up next: vs. Wake Forest, Saturday, noon 13. Florida State (2-6, 1-6 ACC, No. 13 last week): The Seminoles were off this weekend, and they\u2019ll face Duke in a showdown of subpar ACC teams this weekend. Changes to the ACC\u2019s COVID-19 testing protocols should ensure this game won\u2019t be canceled hours before kickoff. Up next: vs. Duke, Saturday, 4 p.m. 14. Duke (2-8, 1-8 ACC, No. 14 last week): On the bright side, the 48-0 loss to Miami is over. On the other hand, Duke\u2019s season isn\u2019t over. The Blue Devils have one more shot at getting ACC win No. 2. Up next: at Florida State, Saturday, 4 p.m. 15. Syracuse (1-10, 1-9 ACC, No. 15 last week): It\u2019s over, it\u2019s finally over! Thankfully, nobody has to watch another Syracuse football game this season. All jokes aside, the Orange competed until the very end. They nearly beat Boston College in early November, and they gave N.C. State a scare at the end of November. The final loss to Notre Dame looks bad at 45-21, but Syracuse hung tough for the first 25 minutes against a College Football Playoff contender. Up next: Bye","664":"The Virginia men\u2019s basketball program will temporarily stop team activity as it deals with COVID-19 issues within its program. Late Tuesday night, the Cavaliers postponed a game scheduled for Wednesday against Michigan State due to those COVID-19 issues. The announcement came Wednesday evening that the team would temporarily hit pause on all team activity. Stopping team activity means Sunday\u2019s game against William & Mary is postponed. According to UVa, \u201cthere has been no determination on how the pause in activities will affect future games beyond the Dec. 13 William & Mary game.\u201d Virginia\u2019s game with Wake Forest on Dec. 16 was postponed previously due to COVID-19 issues within Wake Forest\u2019s program. The Cavaliers\u2019 next scheduled game is a Dec. 19 matchup with Villanova at Madison Square Garden. It\u2019s unclear how long UVa might stop team activities. The length of the pause depends largely on the severity of the COVID-19 issues within the program. William & Mary paused at the end of November due to one positive COVID-19 test within its program. The CAA program was able to return to team activity in just over a week after subsequent negative tests allowed most of the program\u2019s members to clear quarantine. The Virginia Department of Health announced earlier this week that it considers a 14-day quarantine after exposure to the virus to be the safest quarantine method. It did add, however, that a 10-day quarantine is an option. It also added, perhaps most importantly, that a 7-day quarantine is allowed if the people quarantining take a COVID-19 test and produce a negative result on or after the fifth day of quarantine. Essentially, UVa can follow the same strategy William & Mary employed by testing toward the end of a week-long quarantine. Negative results could lead to a return to team activity. Additional positive results could lead to an increased quarantine time.","665":"When Saturday night rolls around and Virginia and Virginia Tech take the field at Lane Stadium, all focus will be on the result. Fans, players and coaches want to see their side win the Commonwealth Cup. While the on-field situation steals the show, reaching the game required significant effort from both sides. Virginia Tech dealt with COVID-19 issues all season, and those issues postponed the rivalry, which was originally scheduled to open the season, until the end of the season. Despite early-season problems with the virus, the Hokies curtailed the spread enough to safely compete in 10 games this season. Virginia\u2019s COVID-19 issues have been smaller than Virginia Tech\u2019s, but the Cavaliers dealt with a few postponements due to issues within opposing programs. The game with the Hokies was moved from September to this weekend. A game against Louisville was moved a week, and a game against Florida State was canceled altogether. Even with the schedule changes, Saturday marks game No. 10 this fall for the Wahoos. \u201cWhen I called Bronco and we moved back the first game, we just shared a moment of \u2018Can you imagine making it to mid-December doing this?\u2019\u201d Virginia Tech head coach Justin Fuente said. \u201cIt seemed like it was years away.\u201d The game now sits at the front of mind for both coaches. They\u2019ve made it to rivalry week. Last season, UVa ended a 15-year losing streak in the rivalry with a 39-30 win. The Cavaliers hope to build a streak of their own starting Saturday. Regardless of the result, both teams reached mid-December safely. There have been bumps along the way, but both teams are preparing for a Saturday game against their biggest rival. It wasn\u2019t an easy road to this point. \u201cI don\u2019t ever question that we\u2019ve made it to the end,\u201d UVa head coach Bronco Mendenhall said. \u201cI think what I underestimated is the constant state of uncertainty and adaptability necessary to get to this point. And quite frankly, I think most teams and most coaches around the country; you\u2019re coaching a different roster each week. And you\u2019re coaching against a different roster each week, and you do your very best to adapt, adjust and overcome.\u201d Uncertainty for the Wahoos included a handful of players unavailable for competition on some game days. Coaches missed time due to COVID-19 protocols. The Florida State game was even postponed on game day with the Cavaliers having already traveled to Tallahassee. It\u2019s been a constant adjustment for UVa. \u201cI feel like this whole entire year has been a learning period with the coronavirus,\u201d offensive lineman Joe Bissinger said. \u201cI think Week 1 we were all still figuring it out. I think we\u2019ve gotten whole lot better grip on it throughout the year.\u201d Following strict protocols to avoid contracting the virus played a part in UVa\u2019s relatively low COVID-19 case numbers. The Cavaliers also implemented additional practices throughout the season \u2014 including distancing between lockers \u2014 to limit the number of players affected through contact tracing protocols. So far this season, no UVa game has been postponed or canceled because of virus issues within Virginia\u2019s program. All schedule changes came as a result of the Cavaliers\u2019 opponent dealing with COVID-19 issues. Mendenhall takes pride in UVa\u2019s successful measures to curtail the virus while also acknowledging outbreaks can occur at any time. At times, it\u2019s also evident he wished more people understood and appreciated the sacrifices and commitment needed to play the games this season. \u201cWhat\u2019s also really clear is once the game starts, really nobody cares whatever happened to get to the game,\u201d Mendenhall said. \u201cOnce the game starts, it\u2019s about the results. And I think that\u2019s from the players, from the fans and certainly from the media, and quite frankly from administration now it looks like. Once you choose to play and once the game starts, it\u2019s back to normal in terms of outcomes.\u201d That\u2019s likely the case Saturday, just as it\u2019s been all season. The ability of fans and media members to focus on the results comes only when both teams make it to game days safely. Mendenhall credits UVa associate athletics director for sports medicine Kelli Pugh and the entire medical and support staff for putting the Cavaliers in position to take the field every weekend this fall. \u201cThe hours alone, if you were just to see that part, it is remarkable,\u201d Mendenhall said. \u201cThe workload and how thin they\u2019re all stretched.\u201d In Mendenhall\u2019s eyes, it\u2019s the behind-the-scenes work coupled with commitment from players that allowed the Cavaliers to reach mid-December still playing football. \u201cIn Kelli\u2019s case in particular, I told her that she was my write-in candidate for president of the galaxy this year, and the universe, whichever is bigger, I wrote her in for that,\u201d Mendenhall said.","666":"When Bronco Mendenhall first arrived at Virginia in 2016, the Cavaliers were barely ready to play Richmond, let alone Virginia Tech. The story looks different in 2020, with the Cavaliers heading to Blacksburg with the Commonwealth Cup after a victory over the Hokies in 2019. The long losing streak ended last November, and the Wahoos enter this weekend\u2019s matchup with a realistic shot of winning at Lane Stadium for the first time since 1998. \u201cIt\u2019s going to come right down to the wire,\u201d Virginia offensive coordinator Robert Anae said. \u201cI think it\u2019s one of those games. Just look at the last two years. I give our kids credit because there were miles and miles to catch up to get to that type of game.\u201d After losing 52-10 to Virginia Tech in 2016, UVa lost 10-0 in 2017 and 34-31 in overtime in 2018 before winning 39-30 last season. The Cavaliers built themselves into a program capable of challenging and beating Virginia Tech. UVa won\u2019t need to play way above its average to beat the Hokies, but it will need to perform well in a few areas to build a winning streak in a rivalry dominated for years by Virginia Tech. Perhaps the most important key to UVa\u2019s success in any game this fall is taking care of the ball. Virginia is a perfect 5-0 this season when winning the turnover battle. When it loses the turnover margin, UVa is 0-4. In a game of two evenly matched teams, turnovers could very well be the difference. The Hokies have a minus-6 turnover margin in their six losses, while they\u2019re plus-8 in their four victories. Offensively, both squads enter the game with what should be ample opportunities to score. Virginia allowed 520 passing yards to Boston College the last time out, making consistent errors defensively that led to big passing plays. At the same time, the Wahoos secured three interceptions to help come up with the win over the Eagles. \u201cThere was a lot of yardage everywhere, so we just didn\u2019t execute our assignments at a very high level, and then we made some critical plays when it really mattered, which was huge,\u201d defensive coordinator Nick Howell said. When it comes to the mistakes, Howell believes they can be improved. \u201cThere\u2019s no like magical formula or rocket science,\u201d Howell said. \u201cWhen things go wrong, the chances that it\u2019s something simple is pretty high, and we just got to fix those things.\u201d The miscues need to be improved. Virginia Tech\u2019s offense struggles as a pure passing attack, but the Hokies are dangerous when they\u2019re able to complete a few passes and lean on their rushing threats, while implementing the occasional play-action pass. Virginia Tech thrives on the ground, leading the ACC in rushing with 238.9 yards per game. Running back Khalil Herbert is dynamic, and quarterback Hendon Hooker runs well when he\u2019s healthy and on the field. He struggled to stay warm in Virginia Tech\u2019s last game against Clemson, so his action was limited on the cold December night. Last season, Hooker rushed for a touchdown and added 311 passing yards in the loss to UVa. He put the Hokies in positions to win, but a few turnovers put the Cavaliers over the top. Virginia Tech\u2019s offensive weapons are more than capable of scoring in bunches against Virginia, though. UVa\u2019s offense can do the same. Quarterback Brennan Armstrong became the first Virginia quarterback with consecutive 400-yard performances last week, and he\u2019s playing exceptional football. Armstrong, along with a solid offensive line and a dynamic group of receivers, has led the Cavaliers to 40-point outings in three of the last four games. Mendenhall praised the offensive strategy after the Boston College game, calling the game plan one of the best of the season. \u201cThe design looks good when the guys up front are doing their job, and it starts there,\u201d Anae said. \u201cThe design looks good when we\u2019re doing stuff that makes sense for our quarterback.\u201d Virginia\u2019s offense seems to have found a sweet spot in terms of Armstrong\u2019s play and the understanding of how to best move the ball down the field given the personnel on this team\u2019s roster. With both defenses struggling and the offenses possessing talented playmakers, the game could turn into a high-scoring affair. Whatever happens, both sides expect a close contest. Betting lines agree, with Virginia Tech sitting as roughly a field-goal favorite at home. Winning the turnover battle will be crucial and executing well in all three phases will be a key just as it is every week. While the game matters more, the keys to winning remain the same as a typical week. Even the limited crowd due to COVID-19 restrictions stays constant this week in Blacksburg. \u201cEvery team wants to win every game,\u201d Mendenhall said. \u201cSometimes when you see the same team for multiple times, you know the players, maybe from the same state or there\u2019s other relationships, it just becomes more personal. The environment, the atmosphere will probably be similar, the personal nature of it will probably be the difference if there is one.\u201d It\u2019s still football with two evenly matched foes, but the game carries extra importance to everyone involved. \u201cI don\u2019t know that I\u2019ve ever said it\u2019s just another week,\u201d Virginia Tech head coach Justin Fuente said. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly not.\u201d","667":"Virginia survived North Carolina 44-41 on Oct. 31 despite allowing 443 passing yards to Sam Howell. The Wahoos allowed 197 rushing yards to Louisville quarterback Malik Cunningham two weeks later, but timely turnovers saved the day. A similar story played out last weekend against Boston College, when the offense bailed out a defense that allowed 520 passing yards to the Eagles. Saturday, against Virginia Tech, UVa\u2019s porous defense failed yet again. This time, the Cavaliers' offense didn\u2019t bail it out. Virginia Tech won back the Commonwealth Cup with a 33-15 victory over UVa, scoring on all five of its first-half possessions and not punting until its seventh possession of the game. The Hokies racked up an impressive 464 yards, holding the ball for 35 minutes. \u201cIt hurts,\u201d UVa linebacker Nick Jackson said. \u201cWe poured our hearts into this season. We poured our hearts into this game, and it hurts.\u201d Virginia hung in the game early, taking a 7-3 lead on an 11-yard touchdown pass from Brennan Armstrong to Keytaon Thompson. The rest of the first half was all Virginia Tech. After falling behind 7-3, the Hokies responded with a 17-play drive that spanned 75 yards and lasted seven minutes and 40 seconds. Wide receiver Tre Turner took a jet sweep six yards for a touchdown to complete the drive with 12:53 left in the second quarter. A Brian Johnson field goal put Virginia Tech up 13-7, but the worst was yet to come for UVa\u2019s defense. Khalil Herbert took a carry up the middle and outran everyone for a 76-yard touchdown to put the Hokies up 20-7 with 4:26 until halftime. Needing a drive to cut into the lead, Virginia stalled out and the Hokies used a missed tackle on the sideline to turn a first-down completion to Tayvion Robinson into a 60-yard touchdown reception. \u201cReally frustrating and certainly an execution mistake on our part,\u201d Virginia coach Bronco Mendenhall said. The Hokies tallied an impressive 331 yards in the first 30 minutes, scoring 24 unanswered points to take a commanding 27-7 lead into halftime. Coming into the game, the Hokies had scored a combined 24 points in their two previous games, struggling to efficiently move the ball. That was no such concern against UVa\u2019s defense, which battled depth issues and poor tackling all night. Virginia didn\u2019t completely fade away in the second half, though. The Cavaliers put up some fight when they cut the deficit to 30-15 with a 23-yard touchdown pass from Armstrong to tight end Tony Poljan and a successful two-point conversion. Unfortunately for the Wahoos, the consistent stops never game. Productive offensive drives were elusive as well. \u201cWhen we closed it within 30-15, it looked like yeah, it could be a really strong finish and a competitive ending,\u201d Mendenhall said. \u201cAnd then some turnovers got in the way from there.\u201d After forcing a stop and regaining possession with a chance to make it a one-score game, Armstrong threw an interception directly to Virginia Tech\u2019s Dorian Strong. The turnover led to a Johnson field goal, stretching the lead to 33-15 with 12:47 left in the fourth quarter and demoralizing the Virginia sideline. The Hokies drained clock the rest of the quarter, leaning on a methodical offensive attack as UVa\u2019s defense looked exhausted. A season ago the Wahoos beat the Hokies for the first time in 15 years. The Cavaliers celebrated as fans rushed the field at Scott Stadium in a remarkable scene. COVID-19 restrictions kept Lane Stadium mostly empty this fall, but the on-field result surely brought joy into plenty of homes in Southwest Virginia. UVa hasn\u2019t won in Blacksburg since 1998. \u201cWe really wanted to win, especially here in this stadium,\u201d wide receiver Terrell Jana said. Virginia Tech didn\u2019t just reclaim the Commonwealth Cup on Saturday; it destroyed UVa in a statement victory in the regular-season finale. \u201cIt\u2019s immediate motivation to get it right the next time,\u201d Mendenhall said.","668":"Bronco Mendenhall arrived at Virginia with plenty of work ahead of him. The Cavaliers struggled in Year 1, finishing 2-10. After the subpar start, Mendenhall\u2019s group won six games in his second year, eight games in 2018 and nine games \u2014 as well as an ACC Coastal Division title \u2014 in 2019. This season, the Wahoos finished the fall 5-5, starting 1-4 before picking up wins in four of their last five contests in a season played during a pandemic. The Cavaliers beat a quality North Carolina team, fought well against Clemson and nearly upset Miami on the road. While Virginia is a good program, plenty of work sits in front of Mendenhall as he tries to get the Cavaliers to the next level. Saturday\u2019s 33-15 loss to Virginia Tech made that clear. \u201cIt\u2019s a good reminder,\u201d wide receiver Terrell Jana said. \u201cJust a good humbling and hopefully we use it moving forward.\u201d UVa lost to Virginia Tech after regaining the Commonwealth Cup a season ago. The loss moved the Cavaliers to 0-4 on the road this season, marking the first winless road season of Mendenhall\u2019s tenure. Over the past three seasons, Virginia has dominated foes at Scott Stadium. The Cavaliers are 17-2 at home. In true road games, however, UVa is 3-11. For UVa to take a step from a respectable ACC team to a consistent ACC title threat, the Cavaliers need to improve on the road. In the loss to Virginia Tech \u2014 and in losses this season \u2014 UVa struggled by making correctable mistakes. The Cavaliers missed tackles, which led to long touchdowns. They also committed head-scratching turnovers. \u201cThose are the things that I always take personally and like to see at an elite level,\u201d Mendenhall said of the team\u2019s soundness. \u201cThat didn\u2019t really reflect how we played from beginning to end.\u201d On the season, UVa went a perfect 5-0 when winning the turnover battle and it went 0-5 when losing it. Avoiding mistakes typically led to victories, while making unforced errors turned into defeats. One issue facing the Cavaliers is the team\u2019s reliance on one offensive player. While there\u2019s no denying most successful offenses lean heavily on quality quarterback play, the Wahoos lean on their quarterbacks to throw and run the ball at high levels. Starting quarterback Brennan Armstrong ran the ball 126 times this season. He\u2019s the only UVa player to record 100 rushing attempts. In Saturday\u2019s loss to the Hokies, Armstrong was credited with 15 carries, running backs Wayne Taulapapa and Shane Simpson combined for just four carries. The running backs were productive on those attempts, rattling off 30 yards for an average of 7.5 yards per attempt. Trailing by double figures led to inflated passing attempts and quarterback scrambles, but the Cavaliers didn\u2019t seem overly focused on getting the running backs the ball in the first half either. \u201cI would say it\u2019s mostly game flow,\u201d Mendenhall said of limited running back attempts. Once it became clear UVa needed to pass to score quickly and make up a large deficit, Virginia Tech\u2019s defense prepared mostly for passing plays. \u201cAny time you become one dimensional like that, it\u2019s usually less effective,\u201d Mendenhall said. Developing a consistent running presence outside of Armstrong should be an emphasis entering next season. Keytaon Thompson acted as a solid running threat as a quarterback\/wide receiver, and he\u2019ll likely be involved as a rusher next season. The true running backs, however, need to offer the Cavaliers more production. Defensively, the Cavaliers allowed 30 points or more six times this season. UVa lost four of those games. For the second consecutive season, Virginia dealt with injury issues on the defense. Even with those injuries, however, UVa\u2019s healthy group of starters struggled, especially in the secondary. The Cavaliers\u2019 defense needs to tighten up in future season if they want to consistently compete with teams like Clemson, Virginia Tech and Miami. The loss to Virginia Tech stemmed from a pair of big-play touchdowns that helped the Hokies jump out to a 27-7 halftime advantage. \u201cIt\u2019s a chip on my shoulder, going into the offseason, going into this next bowl game, going into whenever we choose to play,\u201d linebacker Nick Jackson said. \u201cI\u2019m excited. Definitely gonna use it as momentum.\u201d UVa\u2019s defense isn\u2019t abysmal or the worst in the ACC. It\u2019s a good unit, but it\u2019s not an elite ACC defense. Losing to Virginia Tech showed that UVa is a good football team, not a great one. The Cavaliers\u2019 offense showed promise this season, and the future looks bright with Armstrong at quarterback, but there\u2019s still work to be done, especially with the running game. Defensively, the Cavaliers need better performances in big games. The secondary remains a concern. On the flip side, UVa avoided a large COVID-19 outbreak all fall and successfully completed a 10-game regular season in a pandemic. Virginia won five games, including four ACC matchups. The Cavaliers beat a ranked North Carolina team and nearly took down a ranked Miami squad. UVa\u2019s program isn\u2019t broken; the Cavaliers just want to take the next step. \u201cWe\u2019re motivated already to get back to work,\u201d Mendenhall said.","669":"After Saturday night\u2019s loss to Virginia Tech, Virginia football coach Bronco Mendenhall said the team would meet to discuss potentially playing in a bowl game. There was some discussion that a disappointing result against the Hokies would make the Cavaliers want to compete one more time this season. That won\u2019t be the case. UVa announced Sunday that it\u2019s joining Pittsburgh and Boston College as ACC teams opting out of bowl season, instead giving their players a chance to go home for the holidays. \u201cI think it is appropriate for this team,\u201d Mendenhall said in a statement. \u201cThey have all grown tremendously from the challenges put before them this year. But now is the time to return to families and loved ones.\u201d Fewer than 20 programs were able to play 10 games this fall without a postponement or cancellation related to COVID-19 issues within their program, but UVa was one of the teams able to play double-digit games without experiencing a major COVID-19 outbreak. The Cavaliers worked diligently to follow health protocols needed to avoid contracting the virus. Despite a few positive cases throughout the season, no major outbreaks allowed the Cavaliers to take the field as a team each weekend. When changes did occur to Virginia\u2019s schedule, they came due to COVID-19 issues at opposing programs. \u201cUnless you live it each and every day, it is impossible to understand the mental, emotional and physical sacrifice these young men have made since their return in July,\u201d UVa athletic director Carla Williams said in a statement. \u201cI am proud of their commitment and their incredible maturity. Our students did everything we asked them to do and they were rewarded with the opportunity to compete in the sport they love when many doubted it could be done.\u201d The Cavaliers end the 2020 season with a 5-5 record, finishing 4-5 in ACC games. UVa won four of its final five games after opening the season 1-4. Virginia\u2019s season ends on a sour note, with the Cavaliers losing by 18 points to Virginia Tech. Wide receiver Terrell Jana thought the defeat might change the thought process of some players on whether or not to play in a bowl game. \u201cEnding the season this way sucks, so I\u2019m sure some people might change their minds,\u201d Jana said after the loss. Jana, a captain, also acknowledged the need to hear from everyone after the game. Team leaders met Sunday to discuss playing in a bowl game, and the Cavaliers decided against it this season. Ultimately, the chance to go home for the holidays after months isolating from family outweighed playing in a late December bowl. The year is largely viewed as a success by Jana and company, because taking the field safely despite concerns over COVID-19 represents a significant accomplishment. Tallying five wins on top of that only adds to UVa\u2019s pride in the effort needed this season. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty remarkable to see what we\u2019ve done in a pandemic,\u201d Jana said.","670":"The University of Virginia athletics department administered 754 COVID-19 tests from Dec. 7-13, and four of those test results were positive for the virus. Since testing began on July 5, UVa\u2019s athletic department has administered 14,407 tests and 107 have come back with positive results. The four individuals who tested positive for the virus will self-isolate for a minimum of 10 days as they monitor symptoms. Recent changes to quarantine guidelines allow close contacts of those who tested positive for the virus to quarantine for 10 days instead of two weeks assuming they don\u2019t show symptoms. If a close contact receives a negative test on or after the fifth day following exposure, they can end their quarantine after seven days. The UVa football team had all of its players and staff available for Saturday\u2019s game against Virginia Tech. On Sunday, the Cavaliers decided to decline any potential bowl invitation, meaning their season is over. Players will be allowed to return home for the holidays, and it\u2019s likely they\u2019ll receive less frequent COVID-19 testing moving forward since they\u2019re no longer competing. The men\u2019s basketball program temporarily stopped team activity last week due to COVID-19 issues. The problems led to postponed games with Michigan State and William & Mary. Depending on the severity of the issues within the program, the Cavaliers could return to practice this week. They\u2019re scheduled to face Villanova on Saturday in New York. Virginia\u2019s women\u2019s basketball team played Sunday, and the Cavaliers continue competing amid the pandemic. The Cavaliers are dealing with significant injury issues, but they\u2019ve yet to experience in-season problems with COVID-19.","671":"When the Virginia men\u2019s basketball team plays, it slides down the AP poll. When it doesn\u2019t, it actually moves up the rankings. Despite not playing last week, Tony Bennett\u2019s team improved from No. 18 in the AP poll to No. 17 in the latest rankings. Virginia opened the season at No. 4 in the preseason poll before slipping after a couple shaky performances to open the season. Virginia comes in as the second-highest ranked team in the ACC this week. Florida State leads the way at No. 15. Duke, North Carolina, Louisville and Clemson sit in spots 20-24. Virginia Tech dropped out of the poll after a 20-point loss to Penn State. The Hokies are receiving votes, but are not in the top 25. Syracuse joins Virginia Tech as another ACC program receiving votes. Despite remaining in the top 20, the Cavaliers are currently paused due to COVID-19 issues within their program. It\u2019s unclear when exactly they may return to practice, although it\u2019s possible they get back on the court this week. UVa sits at 3-1 this season with its most recent game coming on Dec. 4, when the Wahoos defeated Kent State in overtime. The Cavaliers were scheduled to play No. 4 Michigan State and William & Mary last week, but COVID-19 issues postponed both contests. Virginia is scheduled to play Saturday against No. 7 Villanova in New York City. Should the game happen, it will be the Cavaliers\u2019 first game against a ranked opponent this season.","672":"BLACKSBURG \u2014 Virginia Tech announced a media availability for Tuesday with athletic director Whit Babcock, setting off a flurry of speculation about coach Justin Fuente\u2019s job status. The media availability is the same day Fuente\u2019s buyout drops by $2.5 million \u2014 he would still be owed $10 million \u2014 but multiple sources with knowledge of the situation have told The Roanoke Times that Fuente will be the coach of the team in 2021, barring a last minute change. Tech would have been on the hook for the entirety of Fuente\u2019s $10 million if they parted ways with the coach, but a source said that wasn\u2019t a consideration in Babcock\u2019s decision. Multiple sources described the atmosphere at the football offices on Monday as \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d with Fuente working out of his office and offensive coordinator Brad Cornelsen extending a preferred walk-on offer to Tupelo High School quarterback Jake Weir while Tech players had a planned off day. The Hokies were 5-6 (5-5 ACC) in a season shortened to 11 games by the COVID-19 pandemic. It was the first time the football team finished with a losing record in the regular season since 1992, but the team is coming off an emotional 33-15 win over UVa to bring back the Commonwealth Cup. The program\u2019s 15-game win streak in the rivalry game came to an end last year. The Hokies haven\u2019t announced whether they will accept a bowl bid this season to continue their FBS-leading streak of 27 consecutive bowl appearances. Babcock hired Fuente on Nov. 29, 2015 to replace longtime coach Frank Beamer, who retired after 29 seasons at the helm. The one-time TCU offensive assistant joined the Hokies after turning around a Memphis program that won three games combined in the two seasons before he took the job. Fuente is 38-26 in Blacksburg and has taken the team to four straight bowl games. Tech was 10-4 in his first season and reached the 2016 ACC title game. The team finished 8-5 last year and won six of seven games to put them within one game of returning to the ACC title game (and earn an Orange Bowl berth). The Hokies brought back much of its starting lineup from last season, but the coronavirus created a series of hurdles that were hard for the program to overcome. They were forced to cancel spring camp and were one of only three ACC teams not to have a single practice. Fuente\u2019s new defensive coaching staff had to settle for virtual instruction all the way through June when players were finally allowed back on campus. Tech faced disruptions early in fall camp as well and had to pause football activities in September as the coronavirus made its way through much of the team and coaching staff. When the Hokies did open the season on Sept. 26 against N.C. State, they had 23 players out and multiple assistant coaches sidelined from positive tests or contact tracing. Tech was missing most of its secondary for a Week 3 loss at North Carolina in a game Fuente said later probably shouldn\u2019t have been played. The season took a more sustained downturn starting in early November with a heartbreaking loss to Liberty. Fuente called a timeout in the final second right that wiped out what would have been a game-winning touchdown on a 59-yard field goal block. \u201cIf we are going to take a timeout, I take it early so they don\u2019t get a chance to snap it,\u201d Fuente said. \u201cI said timeout, they didn\u2019t hear me and I screamed timeout. The ref blew the whistle, they snapped it and we blocked it and obviously it didn\u2019t count. It\u2019s pretty crushing.\u201d Fuente still felt he had the administration\u2019s support as the losses piled up. \u201cI think everybody understands what we\u2019re all dealing with,\u201d Fuente said. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty evident every single day. Being actually on the ground floor probably even highlights it even more. I think everybody understands what this is like. And you can imagine what the administration\u2019s dealing with, right?\u201d Fan support for Fuente dwindled in recent weeks, but his confidence in the direction of the program never wavered. Tech ended the season on a high note by bringing the cup home and ending a four-game losing streak. \u201cGuys, we are playing football in the middle of a pandemic in the most extraordinary of circumstances we\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d Fuente said. \u201c...I mean the notion it\u2019s something terrible is wrong or whatever is just ridiculous. I don\u2019t think anybody has any concept what these kids live is like every single day trying to handle this. Does that mean we should still play better? Sure, absolutely. Let\u2019s take things in a little bit of context here and we are going to keep fighting and battling our tails off and doing right by our players and staff and doing the best job we can.\u201d","673":"The Virginia football team\u2019s season came to an abrupt end over the weekend. The Cavaliers were dominated 33-15 by Virginia Tech on Saturday, and they decided to opt out of bowl season on Sunday. It was a quick end to a decent season for the Wahoos, who finished 5-5 overall and 4-5 in the ACC. \u201cIt just is surreal at this point and one of the most unique, remarkable, inspiring, challenging, gratifying, exhausting experiences that I\u2019ve ever had, and I\u2019ve learned so much,\u201d Virginia coach Bronco Mendenhall said on his radio show Monday night. Mendenhall\u2019s squad was one of the programs to compete during a pandemic, playing 10 games this fall despite COVID-19 impacting the country all season. With the challenging season over, let\u2019s look at three takeaways from the Cavaliers\u2019 .500 record as well as their off-field efforts. Cavaliers navigate COVID-19 Virginia finished the season 5-5, and most fans will judge the year based on that record. While the Cavaliers\u2019 record deserves attention, the team\u2019s health and safety protocols implemented during a pandemic also deserve a spotlight. Associate athletic director for sports medicine Kelli Pugh joined Mendenhall on his radio show, discussing the team\u2019s protocols this season and what it was like to help guide a program through the pandemic. She also shared some detail and the team\u2019s COVID-19 testing results. \u201cI want to protect player privacy, but I would bet it was 10 [or] under,\u201d Pugh said of the total number of student-athletes who tested positive for the virus. The number is impressive, as other programs dealt with much larger outbreaks. Virginia Tech athletic director Whit Babcock addressed the media Tuesday, sharing that about 75% of the Hokies\u2019 football roster contracted COVID-19 at some point. UVa did well to keep its numbers low, emphasizing mask wearing, hand washing and social distancing. The players followed the protocols well by most accounts, which allowed for limited positive cases within the team and coaching staff. \u201cIt\u2019s easier to not go to the extent that we did, but I and we made a promise when we met with all the players\u2019 parents, and we met with them, I don\u2019t know, one or two or three times,\u201d Mendenhall said. \u201cI promised we\u2019ll do everything we could for health and player safety.\u201d The efforts paid off with respectable results, especially given the risk of playing a contact sport during the pandemic. Armstrong is a worthy successor On the gridiron, Brennan Armstrong stepped up. Virginia\u2019s starting quarterback was a question mark during the spring. UVa needed to replace Bryce Perkins, and there were doubts Armstrong would win the job over Mississippi State transfer Keytaon Thompson. Armstrong won the job, aided partially by Thompson injuring his shoulder during camp, and played at a high level over the second half of the season. While the left-handed thrower struggled against Virginia Tech and fought interception issues all fall, he played his best football toward the end of the season. In games against Abilene Christian and Boston College, Armstrong became the first quarterback in Virginia history to record consecutive performances with 400 total yards. When healthy \u2014 Armstrong missed the Wake Forest game with a concussion \u2014 the Wahoos looked good offensively. Armstrong serves as a critical building block for future success. \u201cI\u2019m super-motivated,\u201d Armstrong said. \u201cI think I made huge strides. You can look at everything else, but as long as I see improvement, which I think I have, that makes me even more motivated. I have a lot more room to grow.\u201d Armstrong carried the ball more than 100 times this season despite missing a game and a half, adding that this year gave him a good idea what it takes physical to endure a full college season. The 2020 season represents Armstrong\u2019s first as a college starter. \u201cI\u2019m glad I got to play a full season-ish, kind of see what that feels like, especially with the style I play,\u201d Armstrong said. High 2021 expectations Even with the disappointing finish to the 2020 season, Virginia won four of its final five games. The Wahoos took down a ranked North Carolina team, and they nearly beat Miami on the road in October. The Cavaliers were solid in 2020. With Armstrong returning at quarterback and Mendenhall expecting multiple seniors to return, the Cavaliers should enter the 2021 season as a trendy pick to finish near the top of the ACC next fall. Virginia returns Armstrong, Wayne Taulapapa at running back as well as Lavel Davis Jr. and Billy Kemp IV at wide receiver. Offensive linemen Ryan Swoboda, Bobby Haskins, Ryan Nelson and Olu Oluwatimi should all return for the \u2018Hoos. Defensively, Jahmeer Carter should fill an important role along the defensive line and linebackers Noah Taylor and Nick Jackson will likely play starring roles. Aaron Faumui, a defensive lineman who opted out of this season, figures to see plenty of snaps on the defensive front. The secondary returns important pieces like Darrius Bratton, Heskin Smith, Coen King and Antonio Clary. Virginia possesses the returning talent needed to compete for a league title next fall, and the extra eligibility afforded by the NCAA means the Cavaliers can return a few seniors to the mix. UVa was picked to finish ninth in the ACC preseason poll this fall. That prediction turned out to be accurate. Look for Virginia to be picked in the top half of the league next preseason.","674":"The Virginia men\u2019s basketball team won\u2019t face No. 7 Villanova on Saturday night at Madison Square Garden, according to multiple reports. Jon Rothstein first reported the news. The 17th-ranked Cavaliers hoped to play the game against the Wildcats, but UVa won\u2019t be ready for the game as it deals with COVID-19 issues, CBS Sports\u2019 Matt Norlander reported. Villanova will try to find a replacement game for Saturday. Virginia announced a pause in team activity last Wednesday due to COVID-19 issues within its program. The Wahoos postponed games against Michigan State and William & Mary last week as a result of the pause. Tony Bennett\u2019s team last played on Dec. 4, when the Wahoos beat Kent State 71-64 in overtime. The Cavaliers are 3-1 on the season, but they\u2019re running out of time to add nonconference games to their schedule. UVa\u2019s next scheduled contest is its ACC opener on Dec. 30 against Notre Dame. It\u2019s unclear if the Cavaliers will have time to fit a nonconference game on the schedule between now and the game with the Fighting Irish at the end of the month. Adding a nonconference game in between conference games later in the season is a possibility, but it\u2019s a logistical challenge. Virginia could enter conference play going nearly a full month between games.","675":"Covenant\u2019s Jonas Sanker and Monticello\u2019s Malachi Fields played high school football games four miles apart, but never managed to compete against one another. The two local high school standouts will become college teammates at Virginia. Sanker and Fields both signed their National Letters of Intent to play football for the Cavaliers on Wednesday. \u201cIt\u2019s a good feeling just knowing everything is official, that I get to attend a great football and academic school,\u201d Sanker said. In March, Fields verbally committed to play receiver for the Cavaliers right at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Four months later, Sanker committed to UVa to play safety after originally committing to Boston College the month before. \u201cIt feels awesome,\u201d Fields said. \u201cI\u2019m really excited for the next four years and I\u2019m ready to be on campus.\u201d Sanker led Covenant to back-to-back Virginia Independent Schools Football League titles during his sophomore and junior seasons. The 6-foot-2, 195-pound athlete was a two-way standout for the Eagles. Offensively, he threw for 1,590 yards and 33 touchdowns while also racking up 1,116 yards and 24 touchdowns on the ground as a junior. He was just as sound defensively, earning a reputation as a playmaker in the secondary. In 2019, Sanker ranked among the team leaders in tackles, interceptions and sacks and was an all-state performer on both sides of the ball. Sanker is projected to play safety at UVa and should be a nice addition to in Nick Howell\u2019s \u201cHavoc Hoos\u201d defense. UVa head coach Bronco Mendenhall spoke highly of Sanker in his journey from 8-man football to playing for a Power 5 program. \u201cSome of the best endorsements come from word of mouth in this whole recruiting process,\u201d Mendenhall said, \u201cand when your players in your own program start saying, \u2018Hey coach, there\u2019s this kid that trains at the same [facility],\u2019 you might want to take a look.\u201d At that point, Sanker had already committed to Boston College, but that didn\u2019t stop Mendenhall and his staff from taking a look. \u201cIt didn\u2019t take long after reviewing the film, putting the word-of-mouth references in place and then knowing that we didn\u2019t look deep enough, we didn\u2019t look early enough and we didn\u2019t look strong enough and then we tried to fix it\u201d Mendenhall said. \u201cLuckily, we were able to rebuild the relationship and man, I really, really like the potential and the possibility of both our Charlottesville players. I\u2019m excited. I think it\u2019ll be great.\u201d Fields was recruited as an athlete and UVa coaches were impressed with the way he made plays everywhere on the field. Last fall, the 6-4, 202-pound quarterback threw for 1,119 yards and four touchdowns for a rebuilding Monticello team. He also rushed for 828 yards and 12 touchdowns on the ground. The production didn\u2019t stop there. Defensively, Fields led Monticello in tackles and ranked among the team leaders in interceptions and pass breakups from his safety position. On special teams, he averaged more than 30 yards a return on kickoffs and returned two kicks for touchdowns to take home all-Region 3C honors. Fields is projected to transition to receiver at UVa for coach Marques Hagans, a former standout quarterback with the Cavaliers. Mendenhall has seen first-hand the impact Fields can have on a game. His son, Breaker Mendenhall, played against Fields while he was at Western Albemarle. \u201cI was going to watch [my son] play and then I saw this other guy, I was like \u2018Whoa, who is that?\u2019\u201d Mendenhall recalled. \u201cThen I got a video of him doing like a half-gainer just standing still and just out of nowhere. I became intrigued with not only how he played the number of positions he could play, but his sheer athleticism and size.\u201d Mendenhall is excited about Fields\u2019 future. \u201cIf\u2019 I\u2019m choosing a sleeper pick for maybe the outside world\u2019s evaluation to my evaluation, this is the one,\u201d Mendenhall added. \u201cHe is an amazing young person, but the size, speed and potential. I\u2019m really excited about him.\u201d Sanker and Fields are two of nine in-state players that are part of the 2021 recruiting class for Mendenhall, a formula the two Charlottesville products support. \u201cDefinitely good that we are signing a lot of in-state players,\u201d Sanker said. \u201cJust knowing our state can produce guys and they want to play for their state.\u201d With no traditional fall football season in the commonwealth because of COVID-19, Sanker and Fields began working out together locally to prepare for college. \u201cWe\u2019ve stayed ready by just continuing to work out on a consistent basis and challenge ourselves in unique ways,\u201d Sanker said. \u201cMalachi is a good player for sure and it\u2019s definitely cool that we came from the same area and now are playing in college together.\u201d Fields had similar praise for Sanker. \u201cBeing in the same recruiting class as Jonas is dope because we\u2019ve already been able to work out and practice a couple times together before we get to school,\u201d he said. The two local standouts have also contemplated what it\u2019s going to be like to take the field together at Scott Stadium. \u201cWe have just been talking about how ready we are to get there an start working and grinding,\u201d Fields said. \u201cWe never played on the same team or against each other, but it will definitely be a great experience.\u201d","676":"The Virginia men\u2019s basketball team will return to practice Saturday and play its first game since Dec. 4 on Tuesday against William & Mary, the program announced Wednesday night. The Cavaliers stopped team activity on Dec. 9 due to COVID-19 issues within its program. The announcement also confirms reports from Tuesday night that Virginia won\u2019t play Villanova on Saturday. Unfortunately, the two programs won\u2019t reschedule the game either. The meeting between the No. 17 Cavaliers and the No. 7 Wildcats is officially canceled. The team\u2019s Dec. 9 game against Michigan State is still listed as postponed, not canceled. That keeps some hope that at least one of UVa\u2019s marquee nonconference matchups might be made up. Rescheduling a game against the Spartans could prove to be a major logistical challenge, though. UVa officially rescheduled its game with William & Mary, however. The two teams will meet on Tuesday afternoon at John Paul Jones Arena. The game will tip off at 2 p.m. and air on the ACC Network. That date of that contest has changed multiple times this season. After the game against the Tribe, the Cavaliers will have just over a week off before starting ACC play on Dec. 30 at Notre Dame. Virginia opens its home ACC season a couple days later when it welcomes Virginia Tech to town on Jan. 2. Virginia\u2019s most recent game came on Dec. 4, when it beat Kent State 71-64 in overtime. The Cavaliers will go just over two weeks between playing Kent State and William & Mary, with 10 days away from practice during the break. UVa has been inconsistent through its first four games, needing overtime to beat Kent State and losing to San Francisco in upset fashion. The Cavaliers will do their best to be sounder on both ends despite significant time away from the practice court due to COVID-19.","677":"Redshirt senior defensive back De\u2019Vante Cross plans to return to the Virginia football team for a sixth year. Cross announced the news on social media Thursday evening. \u201cThis program has made me into the man I am today and has granted me an opportunity to chase my dream of playing in the NFL,\u201d Cross wrote on social media. \u201cI\u2019m going to continue to chase that dream and further my education. With that being said I\u2019ll be returning for another year.\u201d In a typical season, Cross\u2019 career would\u2019ve ended after this fall. The NCAA offered eligibility relief to players this fall due to COVID-19, meaning playing this season would not count against eligibility. That rule adjustment allows for Cross to play one additional season in Charlottesville. Cross adds a veteran presence to Virginia\u2019s secondary next fall. He\u2019s played 50 games while at UVa, recording 105 tackles and five interceptions. He\u2019s snatched at least one interception in each of the last three seasons. The defensive back played mostly cornerback this fall, but he\u2019s also spent time at safety. Cross\u2019 position assignment next season will likely depend on which other veteran defensive backs decide to return next fall and which guys opt to move to new endeavors. With good size at 6-foot-2 and position versatility, Cross holds NFL potential. UVa\u2019s secondary also allowed significant chunk plays and missed plenty of tackles. There\u2019s plenty of room for growth next season as Cross looks to impress NFL scouts.","678":"Carla Williams is not going anywhere. Virginia\u2019s athletic director issued a statement on social media Friday afternoon to clarify that she is not a candidate for the athletic director vacancy at the University of Georgia, her alma mater. \u201cI have received many inquiries about my interest in the opening as Director of Athletics at my alma mater, the University of Georgia,\u201d Williams wrote. \u201cI love Georgia and it will always be a very special place to me. I am confident that President [Jere] Morehead and his team will make an outstanding hire.\u201d Current Georgia athletic director Greg McGarity recently announced that he is retiring at the end of this year. Senior deputy athletic director Josh Brooks will serve as the Bulldogs\u2019 acting athletic director until McGarity\u2019s replacement is hired. Following McGarity\u2019s announcement, Williams was listed a potential candidate for the job by multiple media outlets. A quick look at her resume shows why. Williams grew up in LaGrange, Georgia, and was a three-year starter for the UGa women\u2019s basketball team. Following her playing career, Williams was an assistant coach on Andy Landers\u2019 staff at Georgia from 1991-96, helping the Bulldogs reach the Final Four twice (1995, 1996). Following Georgia\u2019s second Final Four run in 1996, Williams shifted from coaching into athletic administration, serving as the Bulldogs\u2019 assistant director of compliance from 1996-97 before moving on to administrative jobs at Florida State and Vanderbilt. Williams returned to Georgia in 2004 to become the program\u2019s associate athletic director. She was promoted to senior associate athletic director in 2008, then executive associate athletic director in 2011 before being promoted to deputy director of athletics in 2015. Following a 13-year stint in Georgia\u2019s athletic department, Williams was hired as Virginia\u2019s athletic director in October of 2017. When she was hired at UVa, Williams became the first female African-American athletic director at a Power Five conference program. She made it clear Friday that she is planning on staying in her current role with the Cavaliers for the foreseeable future. \u201cThe University of Virginia and President Jim Ryan gave me a transformative opportunity to lead one of the nation\u2019s premier athletic programs at one of the nation\u2019s best academic institutions,\u201d Williams said. \u201cI love UVa, our coaches, our staff, our supporters and our amazing student-athletes.\u201d The Virginia athletic program has thrived under Williams\u2019 guidance, capturing national championships in men\u2019s basketball and men\u2019s lacrosse while also earning the Capital One Cup for men\u2019s sports in 2019. Williams also has worked to upgrade the Cavaliers\u2019 athletic facilities. In 2018, she announced the \u201cMaster Plan,\u201d a $180 million project that will upgrade the school\u2019s football and Olympic sports facilities. Earlier this year, the Virginia softball program opened Palmer Park, its new state-of-the-art facility. \u201cWe have a bold vision for how the University of Virginia can lead the ever-changing landscape of intercollegiate athletics,\u201d Williams said. \u201cTo be both great and good in all we do. I am determined to see that happen at UVa.\u201d Williams had guided the the Virginia athletic department through a trying year that has included the cancellation of the 2020 spring sports season due to the COVID-19 pandemic and challenging fall and winter seasons that have been hampered by postponements, cancellations and no fans in the stands as the pandemic rages. With hope for better days to come in 2021, Williams will continue leading the Virginia program forward. \u201cI consider myself blessed beyond measure to be here,\u201d Williams said, \u201cand I look forward to the important work we have ahead of us.\u201d","679":"The Virginia women\u2019s basketball team\u2019s game at Virginia Tech, which was scheduled for Sunday, has been postponed due to COVID-19 issues within UVa\u2019s program. The ACC and Virginia announced the news Saturday afternoon. \u201cThe postponement follows a positive test, subsequent quarantining and contract tracing within the Virginia women\u2019s basketball program,\u201d UVa said in a statement. It\u2019s unclear the extent of players or staff members affected within Virginia\u2019s program, but the Cavaliers were shorthanded prior to the COVID-19 issues due to injury problems. UVa played seven student-athletes in its latest game, a loss to Florida State last Sunday. Four players were on the floor for at least 33 minutes. Injuries even caused the team to cancel a game against George Washington scheduled for earlier this season. This postponement comes as COVID-19 issues now impact the program. Depending on contact tracing and the extent of a potential outbreak, the program may need to halt team activities. The virus recently put the Virginia men\u2019s basketball team on pause. The men\u2019s squad returned to practice Saturday after 10 days away from the court. The Virginia\u2019s women\u2019s basketball team is next scheduled to play on Jan. 3 against Louisville. That gives the Wahoos about two weeks to become healthy enough to return to action.","680":"The Virginia men\u2019s basketball team returns to game action Tuesday for the first time since Dec. 4. The Cavaliers come into the game against William & Mary knowing they\u2019re talented. They also know they need to improve on both ends of the floor. Taking a break from team practices for 10 days, which the Wahoos did due to COVID-19, isn\u2019t an ideal scenario for a team in need of growth. UVa (3-1) isn\u2019t the only team to pause team activity this season, and it certainly won\u2019t be the last. The Cavaliers face an in-state foe Tuesday that spent a week away from the court earlier this season due to COVID-19. William & Mary\u2019s stoppage of practices postponed the initial meeting between the two schools. UVa\u2019s issues led to an additional postponement. Finally, Tuesday, the squads will meet at 2 p.m. in John Paul Jones Arena. For UVa, the Tribe (2-2) appears to be a good opponent to ease back into action against. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t a lot of things we did well this afternoon,\u201d William & Mary head coach Dane Fischer said after the team\u2019s 71-49 loss to High Point on Saturday. \u201cYou have to give credit to High Point for the way they came in and played, but I thought we were a step slow really the whole game. We could never get ourselves at the pace we needed to be on offense or defense.\u201d The Tribe returned just one starter from a season ago, and they\u2019re leaning on four freshmen to play meaningful minutes. KenPom ranks William & Mary as the 282nd best team in the country. The Tribe rank 330th in defensive efficiency and struggle to generate stops. \u201cThis has been a long stretch for us since we\u2019ve been out of quarantine \u2014 three games in six days, I think it is \u2014 and that was maybe a part of it,\u201d Fischer said, \u201cbut we\u2019ve got a lot to learn and correct after this one.\u201d Clearly, William & Mary is a work in progress this season after being a top-tier CAA program a season ago. The inconsistency of the Tribe gives UVa a chance to return from quarantine with a strong performance. The Cavaliers could use a positive showing after starting the season 3-1 with a loss to San Francisco and a tight overtime victory over Kent State. Virginia hasn\u2019t lived up to its preseason hype through four games. While it won\u2019t require a Herculean effort to top the Tribe, Gonzaga waits for Virginia on Saturday in Texas. The Wahoos will face the nation\u2019s No. 1 team in less than a week, and they\u2019ll need their best to keep the game close. Through its first four games, Gonzaga is 4-0 with three double-digit wins. The strength of schedule is particularly impressive, with the Zags beating Auburn, Iowa, Kansas and West Virginia to open the year. They scored at least 87 points in each of their first four contests. Virginia, through four games, has shown little to prove it can defeat Gonzaga. At the same time, the talent is there. Between Kihei Clark, Sam Hauser and Jay Huff, the Cavaliers possess three of the most experienced and successful players in the ACC. Team depth is a strong point for the Wahoos, with the Cavaliers possessing the ability to go 10 or more players deep in any given game. A Virginia team playing well could contend for a national title. The question is when the Wahoos might begin to reach their potential. Gonzaga will be a major challenge for Virginia, but first, Tony Bennett\u2019s team turns its attention toward William & Mary. As shown by the loss to San Francisco and a close call against Kent State, the Cavaliers can\u2019t overlook the Tribe. After 10 days away from practice and more than two weeks between games, every opportunity to play should be cherished by a team in need of development. Tuesday offers a chance for the Cavaliers to get better ahead of a challenging slate of games. \u201cWe got a long way to go,\u201d Clark said after the Kent State win. \u201cI know it\u2019s a long season. It\u2019s early. We just have to learn how to grind it out.\u201d","681":"The Virginia men\u2019s basketball team spent 10 days away from the practice court and 17 days between games due to COVID-19. Even with the pause, the Wahoos showed no signs of rust in their 76-40 victory over William & Mary on Tuesday afternoon at John Paul Jones Arena. \u201cThey\u2019re probably gonna say, \u2018See, coach, practice is overrated,\u2019\u201d head coach Tony Bennett joked. No. 16 UVa (4-1) jumped out to a 17-6 lead through the first eight minutes, outscoring W&M (2-3) with four different players slamming home dunks. The lead grew throughout the first half, with a quick seven points from Trey Murphy III putting the Wahoos up 26-6 with 7:20 left in the opening half. Kihei Clark, who started for the Cavaliers at point guard, scored six points in the first few minutes and looked strong for the Cavaliers. Clark finished the game with six points, four assists and a pair of steals. Defensively, Virginia showed promise. William & Mary ended the first half with just 14 points, marking the second time this season that the Wahoos have held an opponent to fewer than 15 points. Saint Francis scored just 13 points in the first half of its game with Virginia earlier this season. The Cavaliers entered halftime with a 36-14 advantage. Bennett likely wasn\u2019t thrilled with the defensive effort in the opening minutes of the second half. William & Mary scored 11 points in the first five minutes of the second half after tallying just 14 points in the entire first half. Fortunately for Bennett and his squad, the offense remained dynamic and the defense settled in later in the half. Sam Hauser chipped in on both ends and Jay Huff was too much for the Tribe to handle in the low post. Kadin Shedrick also logged productive minutes down low. Huff finished with nine points, four rebounds and three blocks in 21 minutes. Shedrick chipped in 10 points and six rebounds in just 13 minutes on the court. Murphy led all scorers with 15 points. Virginia led 50-27 at the under-12 timeout, increasing its first-half lead by a point in the first eight minutes of the second half. Even when William & Mary found a few baskets, it couldn\u2019t do much to stop the Cavaliers from scoring at will. When the Cavaliers were engaged, they looked solid. \u201cI think for this generation, sustained focus is an issue,\u201d Bennett said. \u201cGood teams are focused. They\u2019re concentrated. Their effort is good in practice in the little things. There\u2019s an execution-based mindset that has to continue to step up for this team to reach its full potential.\u201d The second half featured little to no drama, with the game seemingly decided for the entire half. In the end, UVa took down William & Mary by 36 points, nearly doubling the Tribe\u2019s scoring output in the process. The 40 points allowed is UVa\u2019s best mark of this season. In its first game action since the beginning of December, UVa looked the part of a top-20 team. The defense executed and the offense attacked the basket, resulting in a commanding win over an overmatched in-state foe. \u201cIt was difficult at first to come in after 10 days, but it was a lot easier than I thought it would be,\u201d Shedrick said. \u201cIt felt like we hadn\u2019t missed that much.\u201d","682":"Tony Bennett worried his team might look rusty following a 17-day break between games. Instead, the Cavaliers looked fantastic against William & Mary on Tuesday, winning 76-40. The Cavaliers held the Tribe to just 14 points in the first half, and the offense did well to generate a sizeable lead. UVa didn\u2019t take its foot off the gas either, increasing its 22-point first-half lead to 36 points by the time the final buzzer sounded. William & Mary never threatened the Wahoos, who moved to 4-1 with the victory. UVa had three days to prepare for the game, returning to practice Saturday after a 10-day break from practice caused by COVID-19 issues within the program. \u201cThere is a little bit of hunger in us, and we\u2019re also just so eager to play,\u201d Trey Murphy III said. \u201cAnd then we came back on Saturday it was really clicking, like it was crazy that we were out for 10 days. In that first practice back it was one of our better practices.\u201d The time away gave players a chance to rest. It also energized the group. An additional boost of energy seemed needed for the Cavaliers. Through four games, the Cavaliers were 3-1 with two subpar showings, including a loss to San Francisco and an overtime win against Kent State. \u201cI think we really just missed each other a lot, and we\u2019re all just happy to play with each other again,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cWe were really excited to play again, and that\u2019s what this team is built on, just playing with each other and playing with a lot of chemistry.\u201d The chemistry was evident Tuesday. UVa made 28 shots from the field and finished with 16 assists. The ball moved well, and the point guards ran the offense effectively. Reece Beekman and Kihei Clark combined for eight assists and just one turnover. As a team, UVa only committed seven turnovers. Murphy added three assists without a turnover to go with his game-high 15 points. Kadin Shedrick chipped in with 10 points and seven rebounds, according to UVa\u2019s updated stats. Shedrick said the coaching staff did well to keep the Cavaliers fresh and mentally engaged during the team-wide quarantine period. \u201cWe had a Zoom call probably every night during quarantine and we watched some film,\u201d Shedrick said. \u201cWe would talk about what was going on, what the plan was. They even allowed us to come in, like one at a time, and we would have our own half court, just be isolated on that half court.\u201d This allowed players to get shots up while isolated, ensuring they wouldn\u2019t be \u201cterribly rusty,\u201d according to Shedrick. When the Cavaliers returned to practice, they wanted to balance the need to work with the desire to ease back into action to avoid injury. \u201cIt\u2019s a little bit like drinking out of a firehose, so to speak,\u201d Bennett said. \u201cYou got to be careful.\u201d Bennett called the return-to-practice efforts \u201cstrategically planned.\u201d The Cavaliers\u2019 practices weren\u2019t drastically different leading up to the William & Mary victory, but they did feature a slightly increased emphasis on conditioning one of the days. Whatever UVa did behind-the-scenes, the plan worked. The Wahoos looked good against William & Mary, cruising to a 36-point win and playing 15 different guys. Kody Stattmann missed the game, although an official reason for the absence wasn\u2019t shared. Everyone else played, except for walk-on Malachi Poindexter. A solid showing against the Tribe gives the Cavaliers some confidence entering Saturday\u2019s showdown with No. 1 Gonzaga. The Wahoos will need their best effort to take down the offensive juggernaut and clear-cut No. 1 team. After a long break, the Cavaliers didn\u2019t seem to miss a beat in their one game before facing the Zags. \u201cI talked to them about our two pillars,\u201d Bennett said. \u201cI said, \u2018Will you be humble and will you be passionate today? Will you play with humility and knowing who you are and approach this the right way and with great passion on every possession, the best you can muster up?\u2019 That was kind of the mindset.\u201d Virginia lived up to its coach\u2019s challenge Tuesday. They\u2019ll need to match the effort Saturday.","683":"The Virginia men\u2019s basketball team\u2019s original nonconference schedule looked phenomenal. Entering the COVID-19-altered year, the Cavaliers were expected to face Florida, Michigan State and Villanova. One by one, UVa lost those chances. Florida was unable to compete in \u201cBubbleville\u201d due to COVID-19 issues. Michigan State traveled to Charlottesville for a major matchup with the Cavaliers, but COVID-19 issues within Virginia\u2019s program led to a postponement the night before the game. Virginia stopped team activity due to the issues with the virus, and the Cavaliers couldn\u2019t return in time to play Villanova. As a result, the game was called off. \u201cIt was frustrating,\u201d Virginia forward Trey Murphy said. \u201cAt the time, my initial reaction was \u2018Yes, I\u2019m a little mad about it,\u2019 but it\u2019s something I can\u2019t control. Things that you can\u2019t control, you can\u2019t have a negative reaction to it.\u201d Fortunately, a quick schedule adjustment allowed UVa (4-1) to add one massive nonconference game to its schedule. Saturday, the 16th-ranked Wahoos face No. 1 Gonzaga in Texas. The game will tip off at 4 p.m. and air on CBS. It\u2019s a particularly exciting game given Gonzaga\u2019s start to the season. The Zags (6-0) opened the season with a 102-90 victory over Kansas. They\u2019ve taken down ranked squads West Virginia and Iowa, dropping 99 points on the Hawkeyes in an impressive victory. Kansas, West Virginia and Iowa were all ranked in the top 7 nationally entering this week. Gonzaga has beaten all three. \u201cThey are deserving of that No. 1 ranking, and we\u2019re excited for the challenge,\u201d Virginia forward Kadin Shedrick said. Through six games, Gonzaga\u2019s offense looks close to unstoppable. It averages 94.7 points per game, and KenPom ranks Gonzaga\u2019s offense as the second-most efficient in the country. Two Gonzaga players \u2014 forwards Corey Kispert and Drew Timme \u2014 average a shade over 20 points per game. Five Bulldogs average at least 9.7 points per contest. The squad is particularly adept at sharing the ball and limiting mistakes, tallying 125 assists to just 83 turnovers. Gonzaga is by far the best team on UVa\u2019s nonconference schedule, posing a massive test that has players excited. \u201cIt was nice to hear that we were going to play Gonzaga because we lost our games against Michigan State, Florida and Villanova,\u201d Shedrick said. \u201cI think it\u2019d be cool to get a marquee game in before conference play starts. We\u2019re all really looking forward to it. We\u2019re all really excited we\u2019re going to play Gonzaga.\u201d It\u2019s been a challenging start to the season for UVa. Tony Bennett\u2019s team slid from No. 4 in the AP preseason poll to where it sits currently at No. 16. The Cavaliers sit at 4-1 overall with a sizeable group of talented players, but they lost out on chances to play three elite programs. They haven\u2019t been tested against a team all but guaranteed to make the NCAA Tournament field. Despite that, they fell in an upset loss to San Francisco and struggled against Kent State. Citing a need for more games and development after the Kent State win, the Wahoos were handed a scenario the exact opposite of what they wanted. COVID-19 put the program on pause, keeping them apart and out of game and practice action as they aimed to stop the spread of a potential outbreak. After weeks of inconsistent results and time in isolation as they navigate a pandemic, the Cavaliers feel due for a reward. After several postponements, a marquee matchup added to the schedule is set for Saturday afternoon. \u201cI just had to move on because I just know we\u2019re going to get our opportunity, and I\u2019m looking forward to that on Saturday,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cIt is a really big game and me and my teammates are very excited to play Gonzaga.\u201d","684":"Tony Bennett is no stranger to Gonzaga basketball. Virginia\u2019s head coach even made sure media members pronounced \u201cGonzaga\u201d correctly in his most recent postgame press conference. It\u2019s Gone-ZAG-uh, for those wondering. \u201cI lived out there, they don\u2019t like it when you say Gone-ZOG-uh,\u201d Bennett smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s the Zags.\u201d Before arriving at Virginia, Bennett battled against Mark Few and the Zags four times as the head coach of Washington State, going 2-2 in those contests. The teams featured contrasting styles, with Gonzaga scoring at a high level and Washington State focusing most of its attention on defense. Saturday, Bennett gets his first shot at Gonzaga as the coach of Virginia. The two ranked teams will meet Saturday at 4 p.m. on CBS. \u201cI\u2019ve been fortunate enough as a coach at Washington State to play against the good Gonzaga teams,\u201d Bennett said. \u201cWe had great battles, and they\u2019ve done a really great job with having threats offensively. They\u2019ve always been good all over the court.\u201d Expect a similar battle of contrasting styles Saturday. No. 1 Gonzaga (6-0) ranks in the top five nationally in adjusted offensive efficiency, while No. 16 Virginia (4-1) ranks in the top five defensively, according to KenPom. The Zags operate at the sixth-fastest adjusted tempo in the country, while UVa works its offense at the slowest adjusted tempo in the nation. This Gonzaga team will be unlike anything Bennett faced at Washington State, though. The top-ranked Bulldogs are loaded, possessing several NBA-caliber players and an offense that\u2019s proving close to impossible to stop. The Zags, as their fans affectionately call them, score nearly 95 points per game. They\u2019re as dynamic against Northwestern State as they are against Kansas, West Virginia and Iowa. \u201cThey shot very good against Iowa, so we\u2019re going to have to really make sure we lock in on that,\u201d Virginia forward Kadin Shedrick said. \u201cTheir bigs are also very good. They\u2019re really a complete team, and it will be a good challenge for us.\u201d Gonzaga shoots an absurdly efficient 64.1% on 2-point shots, according to KenPom. It tests teams both inside and outside. Forward Drew Timme averages 20.3 points and 7.5 rebounds per game. He stands at 6-foot-10, posing a challenge for UVa\u2019s frontcourt. Corey Kispert stands at 6-7, and he leads the squad by scoring 20.8 points per game. He\u2019s shooting an impressive 45.9% from 3-point range. UVa center Jay Huff will likely battle at times with Timme, needing his A-game to slow down the impressive big man. Huff can certainly hold his own against Timme. UVa\u2019s center has shot at least 50% from the floor and blocked two shots in each of Virginia\u2019s games this season. Huff is a legitimate NBA prospect. The game could come down to guard play. Both teams possess talent and experience at the position. Gonzaga\u2019s guards are remarkable. Jalen Suggs, a freshman guard from Minnesota, might be the best player in the country. He averages 16.3 points, 5.8 assists and 5.7 rebounds per game. He\u2019s made 50% of his 3-pointers and shoots 56.9% from the field. He also leads the team in steals and blocks. The Zags also have Andrew Nembhard, a Florida transfer who mans the guard position. He\u2019s averaging 9.7 points and 3.8 assists per game. \u201cWhen you play a team as talented and explosive as Gonzaga, I don\u2019t know what prepares you for that,\u201d Bennett said. UVa counters with plenty of talent of its own. In the backcourt, Kihei Clark won a national title as a freshman and led the ACC in minutes played as a sophomore. The junior is an emotional leader and standout for the Wahoos. Other guards include Tomas Woldetensae, Casey Morsell and Reece Beekman. All three players will likely see minutes against the Zags, with Woldetensae making great defensive strides this offseason. Morsell looks more comfortable offensively, making 44% of his shots this year. Along the wing, Trey Murphy and Sam Hauser are as dynamic as they come. The two are the only UVa players with 10 or more made 3-pointers this season. They\u2019ve combined to shoot 21-of-44 from beyond the arc this season and both average double figures in scoring. Shedrick, Justin McKoy and Huff give the Cavaliers depth and talent in the frontcourt. Bennett needs the group to improve on the glass, as the team allowed 18 offensive rebounds in its first three games. The Wahoos allowed 24 offensive rebounds in their last two contests, including 14 to William & Mary in their first game in 17 days after a COVID-19 pause. \u201cI think you\u2019re going to have to be better in every area, not saying we were poor, but that\u2019s just the reality of that,\u201d Bennett said of facing Gonzaga. \u201cI look at that 14 offensive rebounds, you have to have a level of urgency like you haven\u2019t had this year in terms of being back and set and then getting the shooters and everything.\u201d UVa\u2019s talent can compete with Gonzaga, but the Cavaliers need a more complete team performance against the Zags to pick up a major victory. Games against San Francisco and Kent State showed the Cavaliers can look mediocre when they aren\u2019t engaged and operating efficiently on both ends of the floor. The team\u2019s other three games \u2014 blowout wins over Towson, Saint Francis and William & Mary \u2014 showed the Cavaliers can look special when they\u2019re clicking. Bennett and company want to win another national title this spring. To do that, they\u2019ll need to beat teams of Gonzaga\u2019s caliber. \u201cYou always try to have a program or a team that prepares to play against the best, and we will have to be at our best with not a ton of prep or a lot of games, but again, grateful for this opportunity,\u201d Bennett said.","685":"After losing out on games with Florida, Michigan State and Villanova due to COVID-19, Tony Bennett\u2019s team added Gonzaga to the schedule. The massive showdown in Fort Worth, Texas, against the No. 1-ranked team in college basketball gave the Wahoos a chance to see how they stacked up against the nation\u2019s best. Be careful what you wish for. Gonzaga annihilated Virginia 98-75 on Saturday, making quick work of the Pack Line defense and forcing the Cavaliers into offensive mistakes. \u201cWe needed this,\u201d Bennett said. \u201cWe got our games canceled against Michigan State and Villanova, Florida and we got beat by San Francisco. We barely beat Kent State. We needed to play against some teams that are high-major caliber, so this is the first time and we weren\u2019t ready for it. I mean, it was too much.\u201d The Zags (7-0) entered the game with an impressive resume and it only improved after dispatching the reigning national champions. Bennett called his team \u201coverwhelmed.\u201d \u201cI definitely think that a couple of us were scared,\u201d Virginia point guard Kihei Clark admitted. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it was because we were playing Gonzaga or the moment, but you could kind of feel it a little bit.\u201d Gonzaga became the first team since North Carolina in February of 2013 to score 90 points in regulation against the Cavaliers. The Bulldogs nearly reached 100. Bennett and company faced a quick deficit Saturday, falling behind 7-0 as the Zags worked efficiently on the offensive end and UVa (4-2) committed turnovers on its first three possessions. Turnovers and Gonzaga\u2019s Corey Kispert were issues for the Wahoos in the opening 20 minutes \u2014 and throughout the evening. Virginia gave the ball away nine times in the first half, and Kispert scored 18 points on eight shots. He made five of his seven 3-point attempts in the first half. Gonzaga opened up a 20-point lead at multiple points throughout the first half despite star freshman guard Jalen Suggs not scoring a point. Fortunately for UVa, it went on a 7-0 run to cut the halftime deficit to 44-31, making it a game at halftime. Clark scored 11 points in the first half while also adding three assists to go with four turnovers. The Cavaliers leaned on their junior guard to create offense. Clark finished with 19 points, four assists and six turnovers. Unfortunately for UVa, there was no slowing down Kispert in either half. The senior knocked down three shots from beyond the arc in the first handful of minutes in the second half, and forward Drew Timme added a layup after a pair of Kispert\u2019s made shots to put Gonzaga up 62-38 with 15:56 left. Bennett called timeout with the Cavaliers reeling. \u201cA lot of breakdowns,\u201d Bennett said. \u201cWe had a lot of trouble on ball-screen defense.\u201d Virginia never made a legitimate scoring run at the Zags after the 7-0 run to end the first half. The Wahoos trailed for 39 minutes and 36 seconds, struggling to keep pace from the opening tip. Kispert buried a 3-pointer with 6:42 left to put the Zags up 89-58. He finished the game with 32 points, making nine shots from 3-point range. Timme added 29, making nine shots and an additional 11 free throws. The Wahoos are known for stellar defense, holding opponents to fewer than 60 points regularly. William & Mary only scored 40 points against the \u2018Hoos the last time they took the court. Saturday, Gonzaga embarrassed Virginia on national television. The Cavaliers weren\u2019t up to the task defensively, and the offense looked sloppy and inconsistent. \u201cWe haven\u2019t guarded well this year yet,\u201d Bennett said. UVa wanted the best. It faced it Saturday, giving up 98 points and losing by 23. \u201cYou can\u2019t hide forever,\u201d Bennett said. \u201cYou gotta know. Look, we\u2019ve got some warts. We gotta go to work on those.\u201d","686":"Yes, the Cavaliers were outplayed. Perhaps more notably, though, they were \u201cscared\u201d and \u201coverwhelmed.\u201d Technically, UVa remains the reigning national champion, but on the court, the Wahoos were not on the same level as Gonzaga on Saturday. Not only was the execution subpar, but the intensity level lacked. Virginia allowed nearly 100 points, something that hasn\u2019t happened since Bennett\u2019s second season in Charlottesville. \u201cIt was a pretty intense halftime,\u201d Bennett said about addressing his team down 13 points at the break. \u201cIt was about fighting; it was about soundness and toughness. You just could feel it, and I thought some guys, it was a bit overwhelming for some.\u201d Virginia lacked fight at times, while Gonzaga looked comfortable and aggressive. Aside from Clark and occasional plays from Jay Huff, Sam Hauser and Trey Murphy, the Cavaliers looked largely lost and confused. Defensively, players chased from behind, struggling with rotations and defensive assignments. The Cavaliers allowed Gonzaga\u2019s Corey Kispert to hit a school-record nine 3-pointers and finish with 32 points. Kispert frequently caught the ball uncovered along the 3-point line, turning open shots into consistent points. \u201cThere\u2019s an old saying that you\u2019re never more open than when you first catch the ball,\u201d Kispert said after the game. \u201cSo a lot of my shots didn\u2019t really touch my hands for long.\u201d Drew Timme added 29 points for the Bulldogs while also grabbing eight rebounds. Ball movement was efficient and effective for Gonzaga, which tallied 26 assists on 35 field goals. The Bulldogs turned the ball over just seven times, while UVa coughed it up 15 times, leading to 27 points off turnovers. \u201cI think we were kind of playing selfishly on the defensive end, not helping each other,\u201d Clark said. \u201cThe actions that they ran, it just put us in tough spots and we just didn\u2019t do what we practiced, pretty much.\u201d Could the subpar showing be a product of a recent COVID-19 break? Bennett\u2019s team spent 10 days away from practice before three days in the gym before a win over William & Mary on Tuesday. Clark wasn\u2019t buying that as an excuse. \u201cI think we had enough time to prepare,\u201d Clark said. \u201cWe just were overwhelmed and they took it to us.\u201d There\u2019s no shame in losing to Gonzaga, which became the first team in men\u2019s college basketball history to beat four teams ranked in the AP top 20 through its first seven games of a season. The Zags have scored at least 87 points in every game, including a 102-point effort in a win over Kansas. Gonzaga deserves its No. 1 ranking after a blistering start to the season. UVa, however, might not deserve a spot in the AP Top 25 after its performance through six games. \u201cWe helped them out more than we needed to, for sure,\u201d Bennett said. With ACC play starting Wednesday at Notre Dame, Virginia needs to improve on both ends. The loss to Gonzaga revealed plenty of flaws. UVa\u2019s defense isn\u2019t perfect, and the current guys need to play within the defensive system better. The Cavaliers desperately need more defensive fire and intensity. Losing Mamadi Diakite and Braxton Key to graduation hurts on the defensive end, and their absence is evident. While losing those two helps explain defensive lapses, it\u2019s not an excuse for subpar defense. UVa possesses the talent to compete with the best teams in college basketball, but it\u2019s not close to that level yet this season. As usual, Bennett plans to use the game as a teaching moment. UVa has lost disappointing games before, from the famous 2018 loss to UMBC to a 29-point road loss to Purdue a season ago. UVa\u2019s program trudges forward after defeats rather than folding when the going gets tough. Losing to the No. 1 team in the country in December doesn\u2019t signal the end of the season for Virginia, but it does bring a dose of reality to a team picked to win the ACC in the preseason. \u201cWe must improve,\u201d Bennett said. \u201cIf we don\u2019t, it\u2019ll be a very, very hard year.\u201d","687":"COVID-19 dominated the headlines in 2020. The novel coronavirus changed life as we know it, turning mask wearing and social distancing into norms. The virus and its spread stopped college sporting events for months, canceling the 2020 NCAA Tournament, among other events. Even with a severely shortened college athletic season, UVa\u2019s athletic programs found ways to create impactful moments in 2020. Before we bid farewell to a year many of us are happy to see end, let\u2019s take a look back at five memorable moments from UVa\u2019s 2020 athletic year. Baseball\u2019s Field Trip Day: Early in the day on March 11, the Virginia baseball team hosted hundreds of local kids for Field Trip Day. Later that night, the NBA suspended its season due to COVID-19. UVa\u2019s athletic department learned a day later that all winter and spring sports seasons would be canceled due to the virus. It was an unusual day, as universities and athletic programs scrambled to learn more about the virus. During the game, UVa announced classes would move online because of COVID-19. On the field, Virginia was focused on the baseball, unaware of the events taking place outside the stadium. The Cavaliers beat UMass Lowell 4-3 in a surprisingly tight game. The Cavaliers held on late for a victory, with the final outs coming after the kids went back to school to head home. In the early innings, the atmosphere was electric as the kids cheered wildly. \u201cIt was one of the stranger days that I\u2019ve had in this stadium, really, because typically a baseball crowd is not like that,\u201d head coach Brian O\u2019Connor said after the game. Both on and off the field, it was a strange day, indeed. Men\u2019s basketball team beats Duke behind 10 Jay Huff blocks: Tomas Woldetensae\u2019s buzzer-beater against North Carolina nearly made this list, as did Kihei Clark\u2019s game-winner against Virginia Tech. UVa\u2019s win over Duke, however, nabs a spot on the list for the men\u2019s basketball program. The game, played on Feb. 29 at John Paul Jones Arena, ended with a 52-50 UVa victory. It was the type of close defensive battle that came to define the Cavaliers\u2019 2019-20 season. Behind an amazing 10-block performance from Jay Huff, the Wahoos prevailed. Huff came one rebound shy of a triple double. \u201cIt was obviously an extremely hard-fought game by both teams,\u201d Duke head coach Mike Krzyzewski said. \u201cIt was going to be a really good tough win for one team and a tough loss for the other. They got the good, tough win.\u201d Palmer Park opens: Softball seemed like Virginia\u2019s forgotten athletic program for a bit, practicing in a subpar stadium separated from a bunch of the school\u2019s other athletic facilities. That changed in the spring, when UVa unveiled Palmer Park. The beautiful new ballpark sits next to the baseball, lacrosse, soccer, track & field and field hockey facilities. It\u2019s also across the street from JPJ Arena and extremely close to the football practice fields. \u201cWhen they walked in the facility for the first time, it was one of the highlights of my coaching career,\u201d UVa head coach Joanna Hardin said. \u201cIt was just pure joy, overwhelmed, excitement. It was like kids on Christmas day. It was definitely a highlight of my career. Something I\u2019ll never forget.\u201d Palmer Park serves as a beautiful addition to the school\u2019s athletic facilities. There\u2019s hope the new facility will help take the program to the next level. The Cavaliers have not made an NCAA Tournament since 2010. The Cavaliers went 2-4 in the new park, winning their final two games of the season before COVID-19 cut the year short. Jocelyn Willoughby picked in first round of WNBA Draft: On April 17, Jocelyn Willoughby became the first Virginia player selected in the first round of the WNBA Draft since Monica Wright in 2010. \u201cIt was just emotional, exciting, and it\u2019s kind of like a dream come true,\u201d Willoughby said on draft night. Willoughby had an eventful virtual draft night. She was drafted by the Phoenix Mercury before being traded to the New York Liberty. She played her rookie season with the Liberty, playing in 22 games and averaging 5.8 points per game. Football opens season on Sept. 26 with win over Duke: UVa\u2019s win over North Carolina was a more impressive on-field accomplishment, but the start of the fall football season represented a massive moment in 2020. After months of uncertainty, college football returned. The football program wasn\u2019t the first UVa squad to play a game in the fall \u2014 that distinction belongs to the women\u2019s soccer team \u2014 but the Cavaliers took the field on Sept. 26. They were eventually able to complete an entire fall football season without any postponements or cancellations caused by issues within UVa\u2019s program. Issues within other programs led to all schedule changes. In the 38-20 win over Duke in front of a limited capacity crowd, UVa forced seven turnovers and Brennan Armstrong tallied 316 total yards in his first collegiate start. \u201cIt was a pretty surreal experience,\u201d head coach Bronco Mendenhall said. \u201cThere were many times throughout the game where I just couldn\u2019t believe we were playing and that it counted and that it was for real.\u201d","688":"After returning from a 10-day pause due to COVID-19 issues, UVa went 1-1 in its two games last week. In their first game since Dec. 4, the Wahoos rolled to a 76-40 victory over William & Mary on Dec. 22. Following the 36-point win over the Tribe, Virginia was on the other end of a blowout on Saturday, falling 98-75 to No. 1 Gonzaga in Fort Worth, Texas. \u201cThey really exposed some things that we have to go to work on and just try to shore up,\u201d Virginia coach Tony Bennett said after the Gonzaga loss. \u201cThat was discouraging, for sure.\u201d Gonzaga, which improved to 7-0 with the win over Virginia, remained No. 1 in both polls. The Bulldogs have four wins over top 25 teams this season. Virginia was one of four ACC teams ranked in this week\u2019s AP poll. Florida State (5-1) was ranked No. 18, while Duke (3-2) came in at No. 20. Virginia Tech (7-1) rounded out the ACC teams in the poll at No. 24. North Carolina (5-3) fell out of the AP poll after a 79-76 loss to N.C. State last week. The Tar Heels were among the teams just outside the top 25 receiving votes, joining Clemson, Louisville and N.C. State. The Cavaliers begin ACC play at Notre Dame on Wednesday at 6 p.m. Virginia then returns home to host Virginia Tech on Saturday at 4 p.m. Both games will air on ACC Network. Following the lopsided loss to Gonzaga, Bennett is eager to see how his team responds in conference play this week. \u2018This is now where you say, \u2018All right, will we grow from it?\u2019\u201d Bennett said. \u201c\u2019Will we stay unified and come ready the next time?\u2019\u201d","689":"For many college basketball fans, watching games on TV this season has required an auditory adjustment. With games being played in near-empty arenas due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the usual sounds of cheering fans and loud bands have been replaced by eerie silence, the squeaking of shoes and coaches calling out assignments to their players. But on Wednesday night, Virginia fans heard a familiar chant resonating from Purcell Pavilion through their TV sets. \u201cDe-fense [clap, clap]. De-fense.\u201d With no UVa fans able to make the trip to South Bend due to COVID-19 restrictions, the Cavaliers decided to create their own cheering section. Players that were not in the game provided some of that missing fan energy from the bench with clapping, cheers and chants. \u201cIt\u2019s good you could hear the cheers,\u201d Virginia forward Sam Hauser said after Wednesday\u2019s win, \u201cbecause Coach challenged us on that one today.\u201d As his team kicked off conference play, Virginia coach Tony Bennett turned to his players help generate some of the missing fan energy from the bench. Part of that plan was figuring out what cheers the players could do during the game. \u201cWe practiced a couple cheers, put it that way,\u201d Bennett said with a smile. \u201cWe went old school. I asked the guys, \u2018What were some of your best chants when you were in AAU or high school?\u2019\u201d One of the chants the Cavaliers decided to use was the tried and true \u201cDe-fense.\u201d \u201cObviously the \u2018De-fense\u2019 chant, everyone knows that one,\u201d Bennett said. While he challenged the entire team to be more vocal while on the bench, Bennett said he is looking to walk-ons Chase Coleman, Jayden Nixon and Austin Katstra, who rarely see playing time, to lead the cheering charge. The Cavaliers\u2019 bench has been lively in seasons past, but their role as energy boosters has taken on an added significance during this pandemic-altered season. \u201cAs you look around college basketball, this is unlike anything [we\u2019ve seen] in terms of atmosphere and what it\u2019s like,\u201d Bennett said, \u201cso you have to try to get some of that.\u201d Much like the Virginia football team tried to generate sideline excitement with \u201cThe 4th side\u201d during the fall, the Cavaliers\u2019 men\u2019s basketball team will try to generate that same jolt as it navigates ACC play this winter. \u201cNot having fans there, sometimes you feed off of their enthusiasm and their cheering, but \u2026 our bench came together and started some chants,\u201d Hauser said. \u201cThat\u2019s where the energy is going to have to come from throughout this whole year.\u201d Clark in the post At 5-foot-9, Kihei Clark is the shortest player on Virginia\u2019s roster, but the junior point guard showed off his post prowess late in Wednesday\u2019s win over Notre Dame. With 2:55 to go and the Cavaliers leading 57-53, Clark posted up Notre Dame guard Cormac Ryan, who is 6-5. Despite being half a foot shorter than his defender, Clark attacked the rim and scored on a left-handed lay-up as he was fouled by Ryan. Clark hit the ensuing free throw to complete the three-point play and give Virginia a seven-point lead. \u201cI was just trying to pick my spots in the offense,\u201d Clark said. \u201cWhen we\u2019re in [the] three-game [offensive set], we got two guys on the wing and me. Sam [Hauser] and Jay [Huff] are moving around. You can get catches anywhere in the middle, whether it\u2019s up top or in the post. Once I get in a post, I just take my time and I\u2019m just trying to work on it. We work on it a lot in practice, something that we worked on in the past, so we call it the playmaker spot.\u201d Clark shined in the playmaker spot Wednesday night, finishing with a team-high 19 points and five assists. The junior has led Virginia in scoring in each of the past two games. \u201cHe was aggressive,\u201d Bennett said of Clark. \u201cAnd at times we threw it to him in the post and he can make some plays, whether it\u2019s for himself or create for others, so I like that.\u201d Foul trouble For the second straight game, Virginia forward Jay Huff saw his minutes limited due to foul trouble. After picking up four fouls in just 13 minutes of action against Gonzaga on Saturday, Huff played 24 minutes against Notre Dame on Wednesday. The senior picked up his fourth foul with 15:07 to go in the game, sending him to the bench for a good chunk of the second half. \u201cYou got to be ready early, you got to be alert, you can\u2019t pick up any silly fouls,\u201d Bennett said of Huff\u2019s recent foul issues. \u201cYou might disagree with one or two, but you can\u2019t pick up an unforced error, so to speak, and just you got to be really in position.\u201d Huff was effective offensively in his limited minutes Wednesday, finishing with 15 points on 7-of-9 shooting. But Bennett said he would like to see more from Huff \u2014 as well as Hauser \u2014 on the defensive end. That includes limiting fouls. \u201cSam and Jay got to keep coming defensively,\u201d Bennett said. \u201cThey got to shore up our defense better and be more alert. They did some wonderful things offensively. That was showing tonight and yeah, Jay got in foul trouble against Gonzaga and he did tonight, and other guys stepped up. Again, I think it comes down to just having an awareness and alertness, because it\u2019s happened repeatedly, so that\u2019s got to change. I want Sam and [Huff] to take a step defensively and they got to keep working.\u201d","690":"When Virginia and Virginia Tech last met, Kihei Clark buried a game-winning 3-pointer in the final seconds to silence the majority of the 9,275 fans in Cassell Coliseum. Clark\u2019s shot sparked a cheer behind the Cavaliers\u2019 bench and gave Virginia a 56-53 victory as well as a season sweep over the Hokies. When the two teams square off Saturday at 2 p.m. in John Paul Jones Arena, the in-game atmosphere will be subdued. COVID-19 restrictions drastically limit crowd sizes, but even with few people in attendance and socially distanced benches, the on-court battle figures to bring excitement similar to last year\u2019s final meeting between the two teams. \u201cThey\u2019re good,\u201d Virginia head coach Tony Bennett said Wednesday after the Cavaliers\u2019 win over Notre Dame. \u201cI haven\u2019t watched them a ton. I\u2019ll get to that. Obviously our staff has, but anybody who can beat Villanova [is good]. They\u2019re hard to guard, they work hard, they\u2019re well-coached. Certainly respect the job they\u2019re doing.\u201d Mike Young\u2019s team checks in at No. 24 in the AP poll, one spot behind Bennett\u2019s 23rd-ranked Cavaliers. On paper, the Hokies (8-1, 2-0 ACC) boast the better resume. They\u2019ve won eight times, losing only once to Penn State. Virginia Tech beat Villanova on a neutral floor earlier this season, and they also took down quality ACC foes in Clemson and Miami. Virginia Tech plays with good energy on both ends, ranking 37th in adjusted offensive efficiency and 46th in defensive efficiency, according to KenPom. The Hokies shoot the ball well and play hard on the defensive side of the ball. They also bring solid energy on the bench. In fact, Young said an official actually \u2014 to Young\u2019s surprise \u2014 told the bench to calm down during Virginia Tech\u2019s win over Miami. \u201cI always enjoy when our bench is engaged,\u201d Virginia Tech\u2019s Keve Aluma said. \u201cThat really is the fuel to our fire when we aren\u2019t allowed to have a crowd. Everyone on the court thrives off of that energy, I liked it.\u201d UVa (5-2, 1-0 ACC) placed an emphasis on bench energy in its 66-57 road victory over Notre Dame. The Cavaliers delivered a victory and an engaged sideline after a poor showing against Gonzaga. Both teams want their benches to bring energy and excitement to a game played in front of a mostly empty JPJ Arena on Saturday afternoon. The sideline wasn\u2019t the only reason for Virginia\u2019s win over the Fighting Irish, though. UVa limited Notre Dame to 25% shooting from beyond the arc, and the Cavaliers committed a season-low five turnovers to go with 14 assists. After losing to Gonzaga and struggling with turnovers, the Wahoos took care of the ball and played better defense against Notre Dame. The performance wasn\u2019t perfect, but it was certainly improved. \u201cWe definitely made a step in the right direction,\u201d Virginia forward Sam Hauser said of the defense. \u201cGonzaga really exposed us on that end of the floor.\u201d Clark also played an important role in Virginia\u2019s win over Notre Dame. The talented point guard scored 18 points in last season\u2019s first win over Virginia Tech before scoring 10 in the win in Blacksburg, and he finished the win over Notre Dame with 19 points, five assists and no turnovers. The junior point guard played his best game of the season against the Fighting Irish. UVa needs Clark at his best to take down Virginia Tech, which is the best team to appear on the Cavaliers\u2019 schedule outside of Gonzaga. The Hokies pose a tough test for an inconsistent Virginia team. \u201cWe just always got to be focused,\u201d Clark said. \u201cIt\u2019s the ACC; anybody in the ACC is capable.\u201d The road stays challenging the rest of the season. Gone are matchups with struggling mid-majors. It\u2019s conference play the rest of the way. \u201cWe\u2019re in ACC play now and everything steps up,\u201d Bennett said.","691":"The game was called off due to a positive COVID-19 test of a Virginia staff member. The game against the Hokies would\u2019ve featured a matchup between ranked squads. Instead, the two teams may try to reschedule the game for a later date. The news is yet another schedule change for Virginia, which is feeling the impact of COVID-19 this season. The program went into a 10-day pause in December due to a positive COVID-19 test within the team. Tony Bennett\u2019s team has played just seven games this season, with four games being postponed or canceled without yet being made up or replaced. Another 10-day pause may be necessary for UVa, depending on the members of the program deemed close contacts to the infected individual. The Cavaliers are next scheduled to play on Jan. 6 against Wake Forest. The Wahoos are slated to host the Demon Deacons. The Cavaliers now have had two ACC contests postponed. UVa\u2019s game at Wake Forest on Dec. 16 was postponed earlier this year due to COVID-19 issues within the Demon Deacons' program. It\u2019s unclear when that game might be made up. Virginia opened ACC play on Wednesday with a 66-57 victory over Notre Dame. It\u2019s unclear when the Cavaliers will be ready to return to conference action following another COVID-19 setback.","692":"The calendar flipped to 2021 on Friday, but the New Year doesn\u2019t change the challenging situation facing college sports. On Friday, the Virginia men\u2019s basketball team\u2019s game with Virginia Tech, which was scheduled for Saturday, was postponed due to the positive COVID-19 test of a Virginia staff member. The virus still dictates when teams can play, and finishing conference play seems like a major challenge as postponements pile up just weeks into ACC action. For the second time this season, COVID-19 issues within Virginia\u2019s program has led to an altered schedule. The Cavaliers are struggling to consistently take the court as they attempt to manage COVID-19 while playing an indoor sport and traveling across the country. Virginia\u2019s road matchup with Wake Forest, which was originally scheduled for Dec. 16, was postponed earlier this season. With the Virginia Tech and Wake Forest postponements, the Cavaliers have two ACC games to make up. Unfortunately, Virginia wasn\u2019t the only ACC men\u2019s basketball team impacted by COVID-19 this week. The ACC announced Friday that the Florida State men\u2019s basketball team wouldn\u2019t host Duke on Saturday due to a positive COVID-19 test within the Seminoles\u2019 program. Unfortunately for the Blue Devils, they had traveled to Tallahassee for the game. Toward the end of the football season, the ACC implemented protocols to ensure teams wouldn\u2019t travel to a road venue before both sides were cleared by COVID-19 protocols. Both the Virginia-Virginia Tech and Duke-Florida State games were top-25 matchups. Unlike football, which boasts big rosters and coaching staffs, a single positive test can lead to a postponement and extended quarantine period for basketball programs. On the gridiron, college football programs regularly played games without double-digit players available due to positive COVID-19 tests and contact tracing. Earlier this week, Notre Dame\u2019s game with Pittsburgh, which was scheduled for Saturday, was postponed due to a positive COVID-19 test within Pitt\u2019s program. The postponements keep coming. Coach K contact tracing Prior to Duke-Florida State game being postponed, it was announced the Blue Devils head coach Mike Krzyzewski would miss the contest due to COVID-19 protocols. \u201cCoack K will miss tomorrow\u2019s game at Florida State to observe standard quarantine protocol after being exposed to an individual not in the travel party who tested positive for COVID-19,\u201d Duke shared Friday before the postponement. \u201cCoach K did not travel with the team to Tallahassee.\u201d In December, Duke\u2019s head coach questioned the safety of playing this season given the volume of COVID-19 cases across the country and the expected roll out of vaccines to help curtail the virus. His group hasn\u2019t played since Dec. 16. Duke\u2019s next game is scheduled for Wednesday against Boston College. If Krzyzewski is unavailable to coach, the Blue Devils will turn to associate head coach Jon Scheyer. Women\u2019s basketball virus issues ACC women\u2019s basketball also is dealing with impactful COVID-19 issues. The Duke women\u2019s basketball program announced on Dec. 25 that it would opt out of the remainder of the season due to concerns with COVID-19. \u201cThe student-athletes on the Duke women\u2019s basketball team have made the difficult decision to conclude their current season due to safety concerns,\u201d Duke\u2019s chief communications officer Michael Schoenfeld said in a statement. \u201cWe support their decision, as we have supported the choices made by all student-athletes at Duke during this unprecedented time.\u201d At UVa, the Wahoos haven\u2019t played since a loss to Florida State on Dec. 13. Games with Virginia Tech and Louisville were both postponed due to COVID-19 issues within UVa\u2019s program. The Wahoos are next scheduled to play on Thursday at Syracuse, but that matchup is far from a guarantee to take place on time. The Orange went into a team pause on Dec. 27 after a positive COVID-19 test within their program. Florida State\u2019s women\u2019s basketball program also is dealing with COVID-19 issues. The ACC announced on Saturday that the Seminoles\u2019 matchup with Wake Forest, which was scheduled for Sunday, has been postponed due following positive tests and contact tracing within Florida State\u2019s program.","693":"Entering Sunday\u2019s action, Virginia (5-2, 1-0 ACC) ranked 26th nationally in 2-point shooting percentage. The Cavaliers make 58.2% of their shots inside the arc. Last season, Virginia made 47.7% of its 2-point shots, which ranked just 273rd nationally. The impressive close-range shooting benefits a team struggling with consistency from beyond the 3-point line. After shooting 15-of-29 (51.7%) from 3-point range in the season opener, UVa has made 42 of its next 129 shots (32.6%) from deep in the six games since. \u201cIt\u2019s to be determined right now,\u201d Virginia head coach Tony Bennett said of his team\u2019s perimeter shooting. \u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d The Cavaliers don\u2019t lack proficient 3-point scorers, but the number of players shooting 50% or above on 2-points shots is impressive. The 10 UVa players to play at least 10% of the team\u2019s minutes all shoot 50% or above from inside the 3-point line. Jay Huff, Sam Hauser and Kihei Clark are among the most prominent 2-point scorers on UVa\u2019s roster. \u201cKihei was good,\u201d Bennett said after the Notre Dame win. \u201cHe gave us some scoring last game and this game. Again, our scoring and shooting, it\u2019s coming from some more of the interior.\u201d UVa opted to use its point guard in the post against Notre Dame, and Clark was efficient when scoring and creating opportunities down low. \u201cWe work on it a lot in practice, something that we worked on in the past, so we call it the playmaker spot,\u201d Clark said. \u201cJust trying to pick my spots during the offense and just being aggressive and taking what the defense gives me.\u201d Clark is 19-of-37 on 2-point shots this season, a respectable shooting percentage from inside the arc, especially given Clark\u2019s lack of size. At the opposite end of the height spectrum, Huff is posting incredible efficiency numbers. He\u2019s shooting 27-of-34 on 2-point shots. The key for Virginia\u2019s 7-foot center is to stay out of foul trouble and on the court. Huff played fewer than 20 minutes against Gonzaga and missed time against Notre Dame due to issues racking up fouls. When he\u2019s on the floor, he\u2019s UVa\u2019s most efficient scorer. Hauser has been frustrated by his 3-point shooting. The transfer forward is making 37.1% of his shots from beyond the arc after shooting nearly 45% from the distance during his Marquette career. He expects a bit more from himself when dialing up the deep jumpers. \u201cI\u2019m going to stay with it,\u201d Hauser said after scoring 13 points on 5-of-13 shooting against Notre Dame. \u201cI know they\u2019re going to fall.\u201d Inside the arc, Hauser is playing well. He\u2019s shown the ability to make mid-range jumpers, and he can attack the rim. He\u2019s made 59.5% of his shot attempts from inside the 3-point line. Clearly, Hauser brings an element of scoring versatility lacking from UVa\u2019s roster a season ago. The Cavaliers are averaging points 73.3 points per game this season after scoring just 57 points per contest a season ago. For the Wahoos, the difference in 3-point shooting percentage between seasons is just six percentage points. In the last six games, UVa is only shooting a few percentage points above last season\u2019s mark of 30% from beyond the arc. Bennett\u2019s team looks improved offensively from a season ago through seven games this season. The reason stems largely from impressive efficiency on 2-point shots.","694":"As is their custom, the Virginia Tech\u2019s men\u2019s basketball team reserves celebrated every 3-pointer and big defensive stop their teammates made during Tuesday night\u2019s 80-78 victory over Miami. They jumped up from their socially distanced chairs on the \u201cbench,\u201d waved towels and generally brought as much energy as they could. One problem: They\u2019re apparently not allowed to do that. Not this season. While no technical fouls were called, the officiating crew repeatedly told Tech coach Mike Young that his players needed to stay seated. That\u2019s ridiculous. All of it\u2019s ridiculous. The spaced-out chairs, the masks, the mandated bench decorum. If these players were in the game, they\u2019d be banging into their opponents repeatedly. And because they\u2019re not, they need to be seated? \u201cFellas, this place is empty. This place is dead, OK?\u201d Young said he told the referees. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to stand down with that sort of thing right now.\u201d The Cassell Coliseum crowd has been capped at 250 so far this season and will continue to be for the foreseeable future. The fans who were allowed in did their best to create some atmosphere, but just like during football season, the enthusiasm largely is going to have to come from the players themselves. \u201cOur first three games in here, we weren\u2019t very good,\u201d Young said. \u201cThe energy level was not what we needed, and here we are in league play and we\u2019re certainly not embarrassing anyone. We\u2019re pulling for our teammates. We\u2019ve got to generate that kind of emotion from the unit.\u201d Here\u2019s hoping officials ease up a bit on that one. Not doggin\u2019 it Delaware transfer Justyn Mutts has been an integral part of Virginia Tech\u2019s 8-1 start to the season. The 6-foot-7 forward is tied for second on the team in rebounds per game (5.9) and ranks No. 2 in blocks (seven), providing some much-needed beef in the post. Mutts scored a season-high 15 points and grabbed nine rebounds against Miami, but he missed a couple of free throws late that would have iced the game. So not long after the game ended, he came back out on the floor and practiced his free throw stroke \u2013 a decision Mutts made on his own. \u201cI would not recommend a player come back on the floor after a game,\u201d Young said. \u201cThat kid just played his tail off, but he\u2019s serious about it. He\u2019s a good player that wants to be a great player, and he\u2019s doing a nice job for us.\u201d Barron bowl season Following North Carolina's loss to Texas A&M in the Orange Bowl on Saturday night, the ACC went without a bowl victory during the 2020-21 season. Clemson and Notre Dame (and yes, we\u2019re counting the Irish as ACC members this season) were the most prominent victims, but the league also got disappointing results from Wake Forest (42-28 losers to Wisconsin in the Duke\u2019s Mayo Bowl), Miami (37-34 losers to Oklahoma State in the Cheez-It Bowl) and N.C. State (23-21 losers to Kentucky in Saturday\u2019s Gator Bowl). Maybe opting out wasn\u2019t such a bad idea by everybody else. Gotta get \u2018em in Speaking of Wake Forest, the Demon Deacons men\u2019s basketball team went 33 days between their second game of the season and their third, which they played on Thursday night. They\u2019re undefeated \u2013 at 3-0. The Tech-Virginia game was one of three ACC games that got postponed on Saturday due to COVID-19 protocols. Syracuse-UNC and Notre Dame-Pitt also were scratched, but the Tar Heels and Irish played a hastily arranged game in Chapel Hill on Saturday. The ACC entered the weekend having played 95 of its 113 scheduled men\u2019s basketball games, but that 84.1% success rate looks like it\u2019s trending down. At least Tech (8-1) and UVa (5-2) have played a combined 16 games already this season. With 13 games required to qualify for NCAA Tournament consideration, the countdown is on for both.","695":"The decision comes as Virginia\u2019s program remains in COVID-19 protocols. UVa first announced a positive test and postponed game on Dec. 19. Syracuse is dealing with COVID-19 issues of its own. The Orange\u2019s release said the decision was made out of \u201can abundance of caution\u201d as both programs have dealt with virus issues in the past week. For UVa, a challenging season continues. The Cavaliers last played on Dec. 13, and the team has had three scheduled conference games postponed due to COVID-19. UVa has also dealt with significant injury issues, dramatically depleting the team\u2019s roster. Its game earlier this season against George Washington was canceled due to injury issues outside of the virus. On the court, the Cavaliers have struggled. They\u2019re 0-5 this season, pushing through fatigue most games as several key players are asked to play 30 or more minutes per game as the team battles its injury issues. Missing significant practice time may hinder the squad\u2019s conditioning when the Cavaliers are able to return to the court. With three postponed games, the logistics of making up all three matchups could also prove challenging as the Cavaliers try to navigate the rest of the ACC schedule with minimal breaks between games. Duke, another ACC squad, announced in December it would opt out of the rest of the season due to COVID-19 concerns. UVa\u2019s next scheduled game is Jan. 12, when the Cavaliers are set to host Wake Forest.","696":"A UVa staff member recently tested positive and forced Saturday\u2019s game with Virginia Tech to be postponed, but the Cavaliers practiced Sunday and expect to play Wednesday. After the staff member tested positive, everyone deemed a close contact went into quarantine. Those not placed in quarantine received negative COVID-19 test results before returning to practice. The Cavaliers will continue to test for the virus, while the staff member who tested positive and close contacts remain in quarantine. \u201cWe\u2019re very conservative here, and we\u2019re trying to make the right decisions,\u201d Virginia head coach Tony Bennett said of planning to play Wednesday night. Bennett doesn\u2019t expect a full group in terms of players and coaches available for the contest. The staff member who tested positive will be unavailable, as will those in quarantine. \u201cAs of right now, we\u2019ll have enough,\u201d Bennett said. \u201cWe\u2019ll have enough to play. We\u2019ll miss a few guys. It\u2019s more staffing and some players. If everything stays the way it is, we\u2019ll be good to go. Not at full strength, of course.\u201d Wake Forest head coach Steve Forbes said earlier Monday that he knew the game was scheduled to take place Wednesday night. He doesn\u2019t know anything about who might be impacted within UVa\u2019s program or the number of players or coaches potentially impacted by contact tracing. \u201cI was told that we\u2019re playing, and that\u2019s all I really know,\u201d Forbes said. \u201cThat\u2019s the honest-to-God truth. I don\u2019t know anything else.\u201d Forbes added he\u2019s more focused on his program getting through the season. Wake Forest only played one game in December, as COVID-19 issues led to a series of schedule alterations, including a postponement of a scheduled game with UVa on Dec. 16. Bennett revealed no details as to who might be absent Wednesday night, but he did share that Kody Stattmann is undergoing medical tests and evaluations to determine when the guard can return to the court. He hasn\u2019t played in Virginia\u2019s past four games. Bennett clarified that the medical team doesn\u2019t believe the medical issue is related to COVID-19. Stattmann isn\u2019t expected to play Wednesday. As far as Wednesday\u2019s matchup with Wake Forest, Bennett believes he has enough players and staff members to safely compete against the Demon Deacons. As the season progresses, the Cavaliers want to proceed cautiously while also spending as much time on the floor as possible. \u201cIf you can get games, you\u2019ve got to try to play them and you want to be as ready as you can by being smart and safe but then trying to be ready to go with opportunities that are in front of you,\u201d Bennett said.","697":"The Cavaliers\u2019 weekend matchup with Virginia Tech was postponed due to COVID-19 issues at UVa. Tony Bennett\u2019s team had a staff member test positive for the virus. Even following quarantining of close contacts, the Wahoos believe they\u2019re healthy enough to safely play Wednesday night. \u201cWe had to get some further testing and get results before we could proceed and then we practiced yesterday for the first time,\u201d Bennett said Monday. \u201cWe have some contact tracing issues, but we\u2019ll deal with those.\u201d UVa (5-2, 1-0 ACC) beat Notre Dame 66-57 in its last game, taking down the Fighting Irish in South Bend. After missing Saturday\u2019s game, the Cavaliers hope to pick up where they left off when they return to action this week. Virginia Tech head coach Mike Young sounded optimistic Monday that the two programs would find a time \u2014 perhaps at the end of February \u2014 to make up the missed game. Young added there was a chance UVa and Virginia Tech could\u2019ve rescheduled the game a couple days after the postponed Saturday contest, but the quick turnaround didn\u2019t come to fruition. \u201cWe will make that up,\u201d Young said. \u201cLast week of February, we\u2019ve got a week between games ... if there\u2019s ever a time you\u2019ve got to roll with the punches, this is it.\u201d With that game temporarily put to the side, UVa turns its attention to Wednesday\u2019s matchup with Wake Forest. Recent Virginia rankings The first NET rankings of the season were released Monday, and UVa checks in at No. 45. The Cavaliers rank sixth among ACC squads. Clemson comes in at No. 15, while Syracuse is No. 25. Louisville sits at No. 33 with Virginia Tech close behind at No. 34. N.C. State ranks 38th, and UVa rounds out ACC teams in the top 50 at No. 45. Interestingly, Duke falls outside the top 100. The Blue Devils slide into the No. 115 position. Virginia\u2019s lone ACC game this season came against Notre Dame, which ranks 169th. That\u2019s the worst ranking of all ACC squads. In the AP poll, UVa moved up one spot to No. 22 after beating Notre Dame. Clemson and Virginia Tech are tied for 19th in the poll, while Duke checks in one spot ahead of UVa at No. 21. Florida State is ranked 25th. March Madness in Indiana The entire 2021 NCAA men\u2019s basketball tournament will be held in Indiana, the NCAA officially announced Monday. Most of the games will be held in Indianapolis. \u201cI really don\u2019t care if they play the tournament on Saturn or in Indianapolis,\u201d Louisville head coach Chris Mack joked. \u201cHopefully we\u2019re a part of it and we do our part to get there. Wherever they put it, they put it.\u201d Venues for the tournament will be Lucas Oil Stadium, Bankers Life Fieldhouse, Hinkle Fieldhouse, Indiana Farmers Coliseum, Mackey Arena and Simon Skjodt Assembly Hall. One game will be played at a time at Lucas Oil Stadium, although two courts will be used at the venue. The Indiana Convention Center will act as a practice facility for the event. \u201cThis is going to be complicated and difficult; there\u2019s no question about that,\u201d NCAA senior vice president of basketball Dan Gavitt said. \u201cWe appreciate the collaboration among the men\u2019s basketball committee and staff, our hosts and local organizers, the staffs at each practice and competition venue, and our broadcast and corporate partners. We will all pull together and stage a terrific national championship.\u201d The NCAA added that it\u2019s monitoring the pandemic and collaborating with local officials to determine potential attendance at venues. At the very least, some family members of players and coaches are expected to be allowed to attend the games.","698":"Head coach Tony Bennett expects the Wahoos to be at less than full strength Wednesday night against Wake Forest after a positive COVID-19 test by a staff member, but he believes his team will have enough players and coaches available to play the game. As the Cavaliers battle the virus and aim to take the court safely, there\u2019s still an emphasis on winning games. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t fun to get beat by San Francisco, nor get hammered by Gonzaga,\u201d Bennett said. Beating Notre Dame to end 2020 was much more enjoyable for Bennett\u2019s group. Virginia beat the Fighting Irish in its ACC opener to improve to 5-2 on the season and 1-0 in conference action. The Cavaliers want to keep the momentum going Wednesday at 9 p.m. They\u2019re facing a Wake Forest team that has barely played this season. Even as the calendar reads \u201cJanuary,\u201d the Demon Deacons (3-1, 0-1 ACC) have played just four times. They were only able to play one game in December due to COVID-19, and the game came on Dec. 31. Wake Forest missed significant practice time due to the virus, and it\u2019s trying to find chemistry in its first season under head coach Steve Forbes. \u201cI got to find the best way for our players to have a chance to win, and that\u2019s been the hard part not having any nonconference [games],\u201d Forbes said. \u201cI don\u2019t know until I see it.\u201d While the Demon Deacons technically had three nonconference games, it\u2019s hard for Forbes to learn much from those games, including two that came all the way back in November and a Dec. 31 game against a Division II program. Wake Forest lost its ACC opener Sunday to Georgia Tech. The Demon Deacons fell 70-54 on the road and made just three of their 20 shots from 3-point range. Forbes knows his team will have its hands full Wednesday night against the Cavaliers, a program known for quality defense. \u201cIt\u2019s common knowledge they\u2019re very well-coached, they\u2019re disciplined,\u201d Forbes said. Virginia looked sharp against Notre Dame, holding the Fighting Irish to 25% 3-point shooting. Offensively, UVa tallied 14 assists while only turning the ball over five times. Kihei Clark didn\u2019t commit a single turnover at the point guard spot. \u201cI\u2019m not great with names, I know numbers a little bit better, but I know the Clark kid can really play,\u201d Forbes said. \u201cHe makes the whole thing go.\u201d As UVa inches closer to hitting its stride, the Wahoos know they\u2019re entering Wednesday\u2019s game without their full assortment of personnel. Bennett said the COVID-19 contact tracing concerns are mostly staff members, but his comments at his Monday press conference suggested some players could be out Wednesday as well. Virginia has enough players to compete, but contact tracing could certainly affect the depth of UVa\u2019s staff and roster. Even with the virus impacting the team, Bennett wants his team focused on the task at hand. The goal is to stay safe and win ACC games. Winning doesn\u2019t take a back seat this season, even as teams navigate the virus. The Cavaliers face another opportunity to pick up a win Wednesday, going up against an ACC team with limited game action and a new head coach. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely about welfare and all that,\u201d Bennett said, \u201cbut you got to go and you got to try to be as good as you can and compete to win of course.\u201d","699":"The game will tip off at 6 p.m. and will air on the ACC Network. The December meeting between the two schools was rescheduled due to COVID-19 issues within Virginia\u2019s program. The Cavaliers are still dealing with virus issues and haven\u2019t played since Dec. 13. Virginia\u2019s next scheduled game is a Jan. 12 matchup with Wake Forest in Charlottesville. Games with Louisville and Syracuse were recently postponed as the Wahoos continue to deal with the impacts of COVID-19. The Cavaliers were supposed to meet Louisville last Sunday before playing Syracuse on Thursday. The ACC didn\u2019t share any rescheduling news regarding the program\u2019s games with Louisville and Syracuse. Through the opening portion of the season, Virginia has played just five games and two conference games. The Cavaliers are 0-5 overall and 0-2 in the ACC, as they hope to turn things around when they return to conference action.","700":"Virginia men\u2019s basketball associate head coach Jason Williford said Tuesday night on The JWilly Show presented by Locker Room Access that the Cavaliers will be without multiple coaches and two players Wednesday night against Wake Forest due to COVID-19 issues. The experienced assistant coach declined to specify the players who will miss Wednesday\u2019s game, but he did share more detail on the coaching absences. Head coach Tony Bennett, director of player personnel Johnny Carpenter and associate athletic director for basketball administration Ronnie Wideman will be on the bench Wednesday, according to Williford. This means Williford, and others, will not be at John Paul Jones Arena. \u201cWe\u2019re somewhat shorthanded when it comes to staff,\u201d Williford said. Williford says he\u2019s in contact tracing protocols. If Bennett, Carpenter and Wideman are the only coaches available, assistants such as Brad Soderberg and Orlando Vandross will also be unavailable due to COVID-19 issues. Williford says he\u2019s talking to Bennett and other staff members virtually. He says it\u2019s close to \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d except that he\u2019s not with the team for in-person activity as he quarantines. \u201cI wish I could tell you how we got it, who got it, where it came from,\u201d Williford said. \u201cIt\u2019s one of those things, you just don\u2019t know. I can speak for everyone in our bubble, we\u2019re following every protocol that there is. Stuff happens.\u201d UVa\u2019s top assistant didn\u2019t share a specific time frame as to when he and others may return to in-person team activity. Williford\u2019s comments weren\u2019t a surprise, as head coach Bennett shared Monday during his weekly press conference that he didn\u2019t expect his team to be at full strength against Wake Forest in terms of coaches and players. Bennett didn\u2019t give specifics as to the number of coaches or players who would be absent against the Demon Deacons, though. UVa\u2019s associate head coach gave additional details Tuesday. The coaching staff will be depleted, and the Wahoos will be without a pair of players when facing Wake Forest. They\u2019ll watch the game from home.","701":"Virginia guard Kody Stattmann is out with a non-COVID-19 related cardiac issue, the program announced Wednesday night. Head coach Tony Bennett shared earlier in the week that Stattmann was missing time for a medical issue, but didn\u2019t provide specifics on why the guard was being held out of action. According to the program, Stattmann will be out until his evaluation process is completed. Stattmann was in attendance for Wednesday\u2019s game with Wake Forest, even helping the team go through warmups. He wore street clothes and did not dress in uniform for the game. Stattmann has played in three games for UVa this season, but he hasn\u2019t taken the court since Dec. 1. The junior averaged 4.7 points and 2.3 rebounds per game in his limited action this season. His most productive game of the season came in the season opener, when he made four of his five shots to finish with eight points in 12 minutes against Towson. He played 18 games during the 2018-19 season and played in 24 games in 2019-20. Stattmann was an important player on last year\u2019s squad, starting 10 of the team\u2019s contests.","702":"Wake Forest arrived in Charlottesville off an abysmal offensive performance against Georgia Tech. In the first half Wednesday night against Virginia, the Demon Deacons seemed like they could do no wrong. They made 11 of their first 16 shots and opened up a double-digit first-half lead. In the second half, Wake Forest came back down to Earth, and Tony Bennett\u2019s shorthanded Virginia team caught fire. UVa, despite missing several assistant coaches as well as Casey Morsell and Austin Katstra due to COVID-19 protocols, pulled away from an overmatched Wake Forest team for a 70-61 victory. Virginia (6-2, 2-0 ACC) outscored the visiting Demon Deacons 36-22 in the second half. \u201cIn the first four minutes, we really came out and asserted ourselves and cut into that lead and eventually took the lead,\u201d Virginia forward Sam Hauser said. \u201cOur defense kind of just won us the game in the second half.\u201d Wake Forest (3-2, 0-2 ACC) started the game red hot. The Demon Deacons drained five of their first six 3-pointers as the opened up a sizeable lead on the reigning national champions. UVa trailed Wake Forest 26-14 with 8:47 left in the first half as the Demon Deacons knocked down what felt like every shot they took. Virginia answered with a 15-4 run spurred on by quality play from freshman Reece Beekman. The guard\u2019s quickness allowed him to drive into the lane and attack the rim while also kicking out to teammates. Beekman finished the game with 12 points and three assists. He also added a game-high five steals. \u201cDuring these last three practices, we worked on on-ball defense a lot,\u201d Beekman said. \u201cJust staying in front of our man and just making it hard on the other team. We definitely took, over the last week, the intensity of our defense up. I can tell it translated to the game.\u201d The Cavaliers trimmed the lead to 30-29 with 3:32 left in the opening half. Unfortunately for UVa, Wake Forest answered with another flurry of made shots to close out the half. Wake Forest finished the half on a 9-5 run to take a 39-34 lead into halftime. After making just three of their 20 shots from 3-point range in their last game against Georgia Tech, the Demon Deacons drained six of their 10 first-half 3-point shots. Four Wake Forest players made 3-pointers in the first half with Ismael Massoud leading the way. He made three of his four shots from beyond the arc to help the Demon Deacons open up a halftime lead. \u201cThe way he was screening and separating, it\u2019s tough,\u201d Bennett said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had trouble with that.\u201d Bennett and the Cavaliers adjusted on Massoud, who went 1-for-2 from beyond the arc in the second half. The Demon Deacons as a team cooled off in the second half, and the Wahoos were phenomenal on the offensive end. They attacked the rim, leaning on aggressive play from Hauser. Hauser\u2019s 3-point shot wasn\u2019t perfect \u2013 he went just 1-for-6 from long range\u00a0\u2014 but he made six of his seven shots from inside the arc. He finished the night with 16 points and 11 rebounds to record his second consecutive double-double to open ACC play. The Marquette transfer helped pace a balanced offensive attack. All five Virginia starters scored at least 10 points. A 12-1 run that put UVa up 62-49 with 9:08 left all but sealed the contest. Wake Forest never cut the lead to fewer than nine points from that point forward. Virginia\u2019s first half left plenty to be desired, but the talented group came out energized and productive in the second half. There\u2019s room to improve for UVa, but the Cavaliers will take the ACC win, especially without their full arsenal of players and coaches. \u201cWe knew we were gonna have to come together,\u201d Bennett said.","703":"One by one, Wake Forest\u2019s coaches paraded out of the locker room Wednesday night and stopped by the Virginia men\u2019s basketball bench to give head coach Tony Bennett fist bumps before the game. While the Demon Deacons boasted a full arsenal of coaches, Bennett greeted them without his top assistants by his side. They were absent due to COVID-19 protocols. Instead, Bennett was joined on the sideline by director of player personnel Johnny Carpenter, associate athletic director for basketball administration Ronnie Wideman and strength and conditioning coach Mike Curtis. Carpenter and Wideman acted as Bennett\u2019s top assistants Wednesday. In their first game thrust into a more significant coaching role, the two were part of a 70-61 victory over Wake Forest. After the game, Bennett noticed the excitement. \u201cRonnie and Johnny saw each other and they ran at each other and they did like a chest bump, and they\u2019re like \u2018Let\u2019s go!\u2019\u201d Bennett said. \u201cThey were so excited. I think they were like, we can\u2019t lose if we\u2019re the two assistants.\u201d Bennett joked after the game that he asked Wideman a question following the victory, and the young coach responded \u201cThe last two hours were a blur, I don\u2019t know.\u201d The players said the absence of longtime assistant coaches like Jason Williford has been noticeable, especially in practice. Williford and other quarantined coaches only spoke with the team virtually this week due to COVID-19 protocols. Bennett says coaches like Carpenter and Wideman, as well as the team\u2019s sports information director Erich Bacher, were tasked with helping out when needed in practices leading up to the Wake Forest game. \u201cYou hear those coaches\u2019 voices every practice,\u201d Virginia forward Sam Hauser said. \u201cYou know, Coach Williford, Coach [Brad] Soderberg, Coach \u2018O\u2019 [Orlando Vandross], Coach [Kyle] Getter and Coach [Larry] Mangino. It\u2019s just different not to hear their voices, and Coach Bennett kind of has to try to fill that void, but I think us players had to step up a little bit and talk more in practice.\u201d Hauser said the players became more vocal as the week progressed, although there\u2019s still room to improve in that area. Among the vocal players during Wednesday\u2019s victory was sophomore walk-on Chase Coleman. The guard spent much of the night against Wake Forest standing on the bench, even crouching into a defensive stance on the sideline when the Cavaliers were on defense. He kept a close eye on the game and offered thoughts in the huddle. \u201cChase Coleman, I could hear his voice,\u201d Bennett said. \u201cHe wants to be a coach. He was excellent, talking to the guys. He has really good insight on the game.\u201d In addition to player feedback, UVa\u2019s two new assistants were also engaged and discussed the game with Bennett as UVa\u2019s head man asked them questions. Despite their lack of coaching experience relative to Bennett\u2019s usual assistants, Carpenter and Wideman didn\u2019t shy away from the moment. Freshman point guard Reece Beekman noted that the experience of new assistants was atypical, but he also praised the work of those put into new roles. \u201cI would say it was different, but Ronnie and Coach Johnny, they did a great job tonight just with matchups, calling out plays and then defensive assignments,\u201d Beekman said. \u201cIt was definitely a difference, though.\u201d The usual assistants aren\u2019t expected to miss games long term, although an absence at Boston College on Saturday afternoon remains a possibility depending on when each assistant coach exits quarantine or isolation. If that game is missed by some, most, if not all, of the group would likely be eligible to return for Wednesday\u2019s home game against Notre Dame. When the coaches return, the players will certainly be grateful to have those familiar voices back at practice and in the huddle on game day. \u201cDefinitely different for sure, but we\u2019re going to be glad to have them back in a couple days here,\u201d Hauser said. In the meantime, Carpenter and Wideman will savor their remaining chances to step into bigger coaching roles for the reigning national champions. \u201cAs an old guy, that\u2019s what I feel like, I\u2019m like, man these young guys I\u2019m so proud of them that they got that experience and there was legitimate joy,\u201d Bennett said. \u201cI think they need to go have a beer and relax tonight. They\u2019re a little amped up.\u201d","704":"The Virginia men\u2019s basketball team\u2019s game with Notre Dame on Wednesday will be played at 2:30 p.m. instead of 8:30 p.m., the ACC announced on Thursday. The game will air on the ACC Network. The change comes as the ACC shuffles the conference schedule following COVID-19 issues within Florida State\u2019s program. The Seminoles won\u2019t play Saturday against Pittsburgh. Pitt's game against Georgia Tech is being moved to Wednesday at 8:30 p.m. The game between the Panthers and Yellow Jackets was originally scheduled to be played Tuesday. For UVa, it means a Wednesday afternoon game rather than a late-night showdown. Virginia played Notre Dame in South Bend on Dec. 30, opening ACC play with a 66-57 victory over the Fighting Irish. Tony Bennett\u2019s team hosts Notre Dame this time around, hoping to sweep their ACC peer early in the 2020-21 ACC schedule. Bennett is 11-1 in his career against Notre Dame, and the Cavaliers are 15-2 all-time against Notre Dame. UVa has never lost an ACC regular season game to the Irish. Prior to hosting the Irish, UVa faces Boston College on the road Saturday.","705":"The Virginia women\u2019s basketball team\u2019s game against Wake Forest, which was scheduled for Tuesday, has been postponed, the ACC announced Friday. The postponement comes as UVa remains in COVID-19 protocols. The Cavaliers have had four consecutive games postponed due to coronavirus issues within their program. On the season, UVa has played five games while having another five games either postponed or canceled. It\u2019s been a challenging year for the winless Cavaliers (0-5), who were struggling with a lack of depth due to injuries even before dealing with COVID-19 issues. Virginia last played a game on Dec. 13. Matchups with Virginia Tech, Louisville, Syracuse and Wake Forest have been postponed. Four postponements makes finishing a full ACC schedule a major logistical challenge moving forward. Duke opted out of the season in December, which does create open dates for UVa on Feb. 4 and Feb. 25. Rescheduling all four missed games still remains a significant challenge, even with the additional open dates created by Duke\u2019s decision. UVa is next scheduled to play Thursday at N.C. State. The Wolfpack announced postponed games earlier this week, however, as they\u2019re dealing with COVID-19 issues of their own. It\u2019s unclear if either Virginia or N.C. State will be healthy enough to play each other Thursday night. Following that scheduled game, UVa\u2019s next matchup is a Jan. 17 home game with Georgia Tech.","706":"Their fall schedules scrapped, Russ Huesman, Mike London and Curt Cignetti had the rare opportunity to observe Football Bowl Subdivision games unencumbered this season. They were struck by the competition\u2019s quality and intensity, and the athletes\u2019 sheer talent. But the overarching takeaway, what they most hope to emulate in their impending Championship Subdivision seasons, is the discipline and ingenuity all parties exhibited in crafting and following COVID-19 protocol. \u201cThe bottom line is the sacrifices \u2026 that these athletes [made] just to have the ability to play football games,\u201d said Huesman, entering his fourth year Richmond\u2019s coach. \u201cI don\u2019t think people realize how hard it was. \u2026 \u201cI need to tell our football team that what we did in the fall and how we handled ourselves in the fall just to be able to practice, now you have to ramp that up by three times in the spring because there cannot be any missteps whatsoever.\u201d Huesman, William & Mary\u2019s London and James Madison\u2019s Cignetti are preparing their teams for the Colonial Athletic Association\u2019s six-game, spring-semester schedule, which runs March 6-April 10. The league\u2019s southern flank of UR, JMU, W&M and Elon are set to play one another twice each, much like NFL division rivals, saving money on travel and minimizing virus exposure. Richmond and W&M will bus to-and-from games without overnight stays, taking players back to their high school routines. JMU has not decided whether it will travel on game day. The Dukes and Phoenix are playing two nonconference contests apiece prior to the CAA season, while the Spiders and Tribe are content with league games only. At 16 teams instead of the usual 24, the FCS playoffs are scheduled to start April 24. \u201cCommon sense has to override [everything],\u201d Cignetti said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be important to keep your team fresh, to make this as enjoyable for them as possible, and your staff also.\u201d No question. Ask FBS players, coaches and administrators. The games were rewarding, but adhering to and enforcing COVID protocols was exhausting. The daily uncertainties surrounding schedules and test results were frustrating, and by regular season\u2019s end, many programs opted out of bowl consideration, Virginia Tech and Virginia among them. Furthering the challenge for FCS coaches, they must manage players\u2019 workloads during the next three months with the prospect of a traditional 2021 training camp and schedule on the horizon in August. So think fewer practice reps and game snaps for the starters. Cignetti, Huesman and London have countless FBS connections whose counsel will inform their approach to playing in a pandemic. A former South Carolina and Memphis assistant coach, Huesman is especially close to Wake Forest head coach Dave Clawson, who as Richmond\u2019s big whistle in 2004 hired him as defensive coordinator. Clawson\u2019s Deacons lost three of their 11 regular-season games to the pandemic. London, in his second season at W&M, served as Virginia\u2019s head coach and remains tight with his former assistant and Cavaliers receivers coach Marques Hagans. UVa flew to Florida State for a November game, only to have the contest canceled hours before kickoff due to contact tracing within FSU\u2019s program. Cignetti has worked at five FBS programs, including Alabama and North Carolina State, and his brother Frank just completed his first season as Boston College\u2019s offensive coordinator. The Wolfpack, Crimson Tide and Eagles played full schedules, though BC declined a bowl invitation. In short, Huesman, Cignetti and London have heard the yin and yang of pandemic football, the joys of competition, the randomness of interruptions, the inner conflicts of whether playing in the first place was\/is advisable. The FBS provided \u201ca blueprint to how you travel, how you practice, how you house,\u201d London said, citing as examples seating charts on the bus and staggering practice reps to avoid close contact. London found his enthusiasm for watching football tempered in October, when he contracted the virus. His symptoms were minor, but the experience gave him a better understanding of the anxieties inherent in any COVID diagnosis. W&M paused all sports activities in October because of 12 virus cases in the athletic department, and JMU football was curtailed in September. Five Richmond players missed the team\u2019s final fall practice due to contact tracing, Huesman said. \u201cWe got hit fairly hard when we came back to school [in September], and we had to pause for awhile,\u201d said Cignetti, who in his JMU debut guided the Dukes to the 2019 national championship game. \u201cBut I think it was a good lesson for our guys because once we resumed in late September, we had very few positives, and I\u2019m hopeful and optimistic that will be the case moving forward. \u201cYou get what you demand, and I think the message [about following protocols] has to be strong on a daily basis.\u201d On the field this fall, Cignetti, Huesman and London noticed the increased scoring and perhaps some early-season rust for players and officials alike. Otherwise, near-empty stadiums notwithstanding, the games looked familiar. \u201cThere were a lot of teams that played at a very high level,\u201d Cignetti said, \u201cand there were some excellent games. I thought Ohio State\u2019s performance against Clemson [in the College Football Playoff semifinals] was one of the most inspirational of the year. That was a game that seemed like the enthusiasm and excitement you would normally see with a full stadium.\u201d A few ACC coaches this season said they believed canceled spring practices and erratic training camps left defenses behind the curve, especially when it came to tackling. But Huesman didn\u2019t notice any decline. \u201cI ain\u2019t buying all that,\u201d he said with a laugh. \u201cNobody tackles great. \u2026 The athletes are so good, they put \u2018em in space. \u2026 Maybe as they evaluated and really studied and looked closely, maybe they can say that. But as a fan just watching, that to me was not something that jumped off the screen. \u201cIt\u2019s the way the game is now. When you\u2019re out there in space, and they throw a bubble [screen], and it\u2019s one-on-one, that ain\u2019t real easy now, unless you\u2019ve got some stiff running the ball. But they put DeVonta Smith out there, he just makes you miss and outruns you.\u201d Smith, Alabama\u2019s sublime receiver, won the Heisman Trophy and leads the Crimson Tide into Monday\u2019s scheduled national championship game against Ohio State in Miami Gardens, Fla. The FCS playoff final is scheduled for May 15 or 16 in Frisco, Texas, and like their FBS colleagues during the fall, Huesman, London and Cignetti just hope their spring season can reach the finish line. \u201cI was glad [the FBS] got to play,\u201d Huesman said. \u201cI think everybody throughout the country needed it. For me, I needed it, and I watched. [Now our players] need to line up against somebody else this spring and compete.\u201d","707":"Saturday was one of those days. The big man scored Virginia\u2019s first two points of the game and didn\u2019t let up throughout the afternoon, finishing with 18 points, eight rebounds and five blocks to help lead the Cavaliers to a 61-49 victory over Boston College. The blocks all came in the first half of play. \u201cTo be honest, I feel like I probably dropped my shooting percentage today because I missed a few chippies, a few easy ones or just some that I would like to make,\u201d Huff said, \u201cbut it still felt good to have a good, strong first half, and I wanted to make sure I led that into the second half.\u201d When Huff was on the floor, UVa (7-2, 3-0 ACC) outscored Boston College (2-9, 0-5 ACC) by 30 points. About the only thing that went wrong for Huff were his four missed shots \u2014 and a few late fouls. He correctly noted that his 7-for-11 shooting performance (63.6%) did actually fall slightly below his previous season-long shooting percentage of 68.5%. Virginia started the road game strong, jumping out to a 13-5 lead in the first six minutes. The offense was clicking as Sam Hauser, Huff and Trey Murphy combined for the squad\u2019s first 13 points. Reece Beekman and Kihei Clark acted as facilitators to set up the offense. After a Huff free throw put UVa up 13-5, the Cavaliers went ice cold. They started missing shots, driving into blocked shots in the lane and committing sloppy turnovers. Boston College\u2019s offense never caught fire, but UVa went more than eight minutes without a point. The Eagles reeled off a 14-0 run and took a 25-18 lead over the Wahoos with four minutes left in the opening half. \u201cWe really just don\u2019t want to get down on ourselves when that happens because we\u2019ve been in that situation before,\u201d Huff said. \u201cI\u2019ve been in more \u201810 seconds left in the game, down two or up two\u2019 situations than I can count, so it doesn\u2019t really make me nervous anymore. Same goes for when a team goes on a run. It kind of is what it is.\u201d The run led to a Virginia timeout, and the Cavaliers responded to Tony Bennett\u2019s message. \u201cI said make some shots,\u201d Bennett joked. \u201cI said you\u2019ve got to be aggressive. I said we\u2019re standing, we gotta move the ball.\u201d They ripped off an 11-1 run to close the half, taking a 29-26 lead into the break. Boston College tied the game on its first shot of the second half, a 3-pointer from CJ Felder. UVa quickly answered with a jumper by Clark, and the Cavaliers never relinquished the lead over the final 19 minutes. Clark finished with 12 points on 6-for-8 shooting. He\u2019s committed just four turnovers in three ACC games after a six-turnover showing against Gonzaga. \u201cJust trying to do my job as best I can as a point guard,\u201d Clark said. The Eagles, who were without a few players, including defense stud Steffon Mitchell, failed to make a late run to capture the lead as UVa\u2019s defense remained solid all afternoon. Huff kept scoring, Clark penetrated into the lane and Hauser started to attack on the offense end to help close out the Eagles. Hauser finished the game with 17 points and 10 rebounds, picking up his third consecutive double-double. Even without Casey Morsell, Kody Stattmann and Kadin Shedrick, who missed the game with a non-COVID illness, the Cavaliers had plenty of firepower. They also had assistant coaches Jason Williford and Brad Soderberg, who missed Wednesday\u2019s win over Wake Forest due to COVID-19 protocols, back on the bench. Virginia led 43-38 with just over 10 minutes left, and the Cavaliers rattled off a 13-1 run to take a commanding 56-39 led with six minutes remaining in the contest. Hauser and Huff scored the final 11 points of the 13-1 run. The Cavaliers held on for the commanding victory. Even with a few cold shooting spells, Virginia\u2019s defense played well throughout the contest. UVa held Boston College to just 30.9% shooting and a season-low 49 points. The team\u2019s previous scoring low was 63 points. \u201cOffense can come and go, but your defense can\u2019t,\u201d Bennett said. Led by Huff, Hauser and quality defense, UVa earned its third consecutive win.","708":"With Casey Morsell and Kody Stattmann both out Saturday, Virginia opted for a dual-point-guard lineup for most of the game. UVa did the same in the game prior, a win over Wake Forest. With a lack of guard depth, Bennett opted to give his two shifty ball handlers a chance to play together for most of a game. UVa\u2019s point guards delivered in both contests, tallying a combined 12 assists compared to just six turnovers. They also scored a combined 38 points over the two games. \u201cGuys that have feel, they can see stuff. They draw, they kick, they know how to play and put pressure by penetration, [they] are important,\u201d Virginia head coach Tony Bennett said. \u201cI think Reece and Kihei, they\u2019ve done a good job.\u201d Last season, UVa only had one game with seven or fewer committed turnovers. This season, the Cavaliers have recorded five games with seven or fewer turnovers, including all three conference games thus far. Clark says the two point guard look reminds him of his freshman year, when he took the floor with Ty Jerome. The look provides UVa with different options in terms of which player might facilitate the offense each time down the floor. It\u2019s early in the season, but the duo seems to be gaining confidence playing together. \u201cI think we just try to play off of each other, just try to learn each other\u2019s strengths and just what we\u2019d like to do, but it\u2019s fun being on the court with him at the same time,\u201d Clark said. Morsell should return to action shortly after missing time due to COVID-19 contact tracing protocols, but the lineup gives something Bennett to consider for future games. Against Wake Forest and Boston College, Virginia started Beekman, Clark, Jay Huff, Sam Hauser and Trey Murphy. Huff played center, while Murphy and Hauser operated along the wing and in the post at times. The lineup provides tremendous offensive upside, and it also meets Bennett\u2019s defensive standards. Virginia held Boston College to a season-low 49 points. Wake Forest only managed 22 points in the second half against the Wahoos. \u201cReece is long, Trey is long, I thought that was significant,\u201d Bennett said. \u201cAnd again, we made a few adjustments with our personnel that helped us, but I liked it \u2026 I think all those guys that are first years to our system, Trey, Reece, Sam haven\u2019t played. I think they\u2019re, at least the last couple games they\u2019ve gone in the right direction and it\u2019s helped our team defense.\u201d While Beekman and Clark didn\u2019t tally any steals against Boston College, Bennett liked the defense from the two point guards. In the game prior, they combined for seven steals against the Demon Deacons. Beekman accounted for five of those. \u201cI thought the on-ball defense today was the best we\u2019ve had,\u201d Bennett said after the Boston College win. As UVa continues to toy with its lineup as the season progresses, the Cavaliers may have found something worth exploring with their dual-point-guard lineup.","709":"The game, currently scheduled for Wednesday at 4:30 p.m. on the ACC Network after two time changes in recent days, pits two programs that played against each other just a couple weeks ago. In the first meeting, Virginia (7-2, 3-0 ACC) beat Notre Dame 66-57 in part due to a 19-point performance from Kihei Clark. Clark tallied five assists and no turnovers in the victory. He\u2019s playing well and figures to be an important factor in UVa\u2019s plan of attack this time around. \u201cKihei was good in that game,\u201d head coach Tony Bennett said Monday. \u201cHe really put a lot of pressure on them. More driving, I don\u2019t think it was as much scoring in the post. He might have had one or two of those, but anytime you can put pressure on the paint, whether it\u2019s to draw and kick or do things, you want that and you try to have a good balance.\u201d Notre Dame, which is just 3-7 on the season and 0-4 in ACC games, desperately wants to pick up its first victory since Dec. 23. The Fighting Irish will need to contain Clark and a UVa team gaining confidence to earn the win. Bennett was unsure of the potential availability of Kadin Shedrick and Kody Stattmann heading into Wednesday\u2019s game. He shared on his radio show Monday night that Casey Morsell and Austin Katstra returned to practice. Bennett did not provide an update during his Monday press conference on the assistant coaches who missed the game against Boston College due to COVID-19 protocols. For UVa, a win over Notre Dame sets up a massive ACC showdown on Saturday with an unexpectedly fantastic Clemson squad. Clemson hopeful to host UVa  Clemson started the basketball season as well as any ACC team. The Tigers sit at 9-1 this season, boasting a 3-1 start in conference play. They\u2019ve racked up wins over Florida State, N.C. State, Maryland and Purdue, among others. Until late last week, it was an ideal start to the 2020-21 college basketball season. Unfortunately, COVID-19 issues forced Clemson to temporarily halt team activity. The Tigers announced the pause on Jan. 8, and two games were postponed as a result. The team\u2019s next scheduled game is a Saturday evening home matchup with UVa. Clemson head coach Brad Brownell is hopeful the game against Virginia can still take place as scheduled. Brownell shared Monday that he\u2019s looking toward Tuesday or Wednesday for a return to practice, assuming COVID-19 test results allow for the return to the court. \u201cWe\u2019re hopeful that all of our testing comes back good and so we can get back out and then it\u2019ll be just normal practices, whether it\u2019s Tuesday, Wednesday,\u201d Brownell said. A midweek return would allow ample time for the Tigers to prepare for Saturday\u2019s showdown between teams near the top of the ACC standings. Latest rankings Virginia sat at No. 32 in the NET rankings released Monday morning. The Cavaliers are the fourth-best team in the ACC, according to the metric. Clemson leads the conference in the NET rankings, coming in at No. 17. Louisville checks in at No. 27, while Virginia Tech earns the No. 30 ranking, just barely ahead of UVa. Of note, UVa\u2019s three ACC wins this season are against Notre Dame, Wake Forest and Boston College. Those three teams sit at the bottom of the ACC, according to the NET, with Wake Forest at No. 134, Boston College at 154 and Notre Dame last at 156th. The AP poll gives UVa more love than the NET rankings. AP poll voters placed UVa at No. 18. The Cavaliers were 22nd last week, but moved up the rankings after picking up wins over Wake Forest and Boston College. Clemson ranks 12th nationally, while Louisville sits at No. 16. UVa is third among ACC teams in the poll, but two teams sit close behind as Duke is No. 19 and Virginia Tech is No. 20.","710":"A challenging season for the Virginia women\u2019s basketball team keeps getting tougher. The ACC announced Tuesday that UVa\u2019s game with N.C. State, which was scheduled for Thursday, has been postponed. Both Virginia and N.C. State remain in COVID-19 protocols as they deal with virus issues within their respective programs. The Cavaliers\u2019 scheduled game with Georgia Tech on Sunday also was postponed. With the postponements, UVa\u2019s next scheduled game is a Jan. 21 home contest with North Carolina. The Cavaliers have not played a game since Dec. 13, and they\u2019ve seen their last six scheduled games postponed. Earlier in the season, Virginia also had a game canceled due to injury issues within the program. Tina Thompson\u2019s team is 0-5 when it\u2019s been able to take the court safely for games this season. The Cavaliers have struggled with depth, as players have missed time due to injury. Virginia entered the season young and inexperienced, and the increased lack of depth has led to on-court struggles through a small sample size of games this season. It\u2019s been an extremely difficult year for the Wahoos, who aren\u2019t alone in dealing with COVID-19 issues. Duke opted out of the season in December due to COVID-19 concerns. Florida State, N.C. State and Syracuse are all also dealing with COVID-19 issues of their own, leading to schedule changes. Three ACC games scheduled for Thursday, including UVa\u2019s matchup, were postponed.","711":"Virginia men\u2019s basketball fans were waiting for this version of the Cavaliers. After a rocky start to nonconference play, the Cavaliers seem like the team people expected them to be in the preseason. Wednesday against Notre Dame, the offense operated efficiently and the defense forced contested shots in one of the team\u2019s most complete showings of the season. Sam Hauser came one rebound shy of his fourth consecutive double-double, Jay Huff calmly drained four shots from beyond the arc and Casey Morsell looked like the best version of himself on both ends as UVa cruised by Notre Dame, 80-68, at John Paul Jones Arena. Morsell, coming off a break due to COVID-19 contact tracing protocols, scored 15 points on 6-of-7 shooting. \u201cI was really excited to see Casey come back,\u201d Virginia coach Tony Bennett said. \u201cI said to him, \u2018Practice? Practice is overrated.\u2019 I said, \u2018You get another 10-day break.\u2019\u201d The surging Cavaliers controlled the game from the opening minutes. They opened the game with a 3-pointer from Huff and led for the majority of the game, with Notre Dame taking a 6-5 lead for just 19 seconds before Trey Murphy drained a 3-pointer to put the Wahoos back on top. Virginia led the rest of the game. With the Wahoos leading 24-18, Huff knocked down 3-pointers on consecutive possessions to give Virginia a 30-18 lead with 3:40 left in the first half. The 3\u2019s were solid, but it\u2019s what followed defensively that generated a big fist pump from Bennett. Huff stepped in front of Notre Dame guard Prentiss Hubb near UVa\u2019s bench. He hit the ground, and the official turned the other way to signal for an offensive foul. The bench mobbed Huff, helping him to his feet where he was quickly greeted by a high five from Bennett. \u201cI never intentionally took charges in high school, college, none of it has been intentional,\u201d Huff said. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of worked out to where I\u2019ve gotten a couple, and I\u2019ve gotten kind of lucky, so that was exciting.\u201d UVa\u2019s center finished the first half with 12 points thanks to four made 3-pointers. He added six points in the second half Hauser, while not drawing a bench-erupting charge, scored 13 points and added six rebounds in the first half. He ended the game with 15 points and nine rebounds. The Marquette transfer went to work in the mid-range and post in the first half, taking defenders one-on-one with a variety of moves. The result was 5-for-7 shooting in the first half. Virginia led 37-25 at halftime, as the Fighting Irish went an abysmal 1-of-13 from 3-point range. Behind Hauser, Huff and solid play from Morsell, who was a perfect 3-for-3 on 3-pointers, Virginia opened up its lead in the opening minutes of the second half. The Cavaliers started the half on a 20-8 run to take a commanding 57-33 lead. Notre Dame\u2019s offense struggled for the first 30 minutes before finally finding some life toward the end of the game. The Fighting Irish outscored Virginia 25-11 after falling behind 57-33 to pull within 68-58. Cormac Ryan scored all 16 of his points for Notre Dame in the second half. \u201cI thought we drifted into some old habits defensively that aren\u2019t gonna cut it, and that was disappointing,\u201d Bennett said. \u201cBut yes, there was some good defense in the first half, good ball movement.\u201d UVa ended Notre Dame\u2019s hope with a 7-0 run in response. The run began with a Morsell 3-pointer and was punctuated by a stolen inbounds pass and dunk from Reece Beekman, who played solidly yet again for the Cavaliers. \u201cI just used the quarantine to my advantage,\u201d Morsell said. \u201cI was fresh. My shoulder felt good. I just came out there really relaxed and confident and ready to go.\u201d The road gets tougher for UVa, with a trip to No. 12 Clemson coming on Saturday. Fortunately for Virginia, it\u2019s starting to look the part of the ACC preseason favorite.","712":"The Virginia women\u2019s basketball program announced Wednesday that it\u2019s opting out of the rest of the 2020-21 season due to health and safety concerns. \u201cWe have the pleasure of coaching a very resilient group of young women who have fought through injuries, a strict COVID-19 protocol, and all the mental battles that come with it,\u201d Virginia head coach Tina Thompson said in a statement. \u201cSo, the decision to end our season mid-stream comes with great difficulty. As difficult as it is to end our season in this manner, it is a necessary one.\u201d The Cavaliers, who last played on Dec. 13, struggled to take the court due to COVID-19 issues. Six consecutive UVa games had been postponed prior to the program\u2019s announcement that it would cancel the season. UVa also canceled a game earlier this year due to injury issues. The Cavaliers only had six players available for a game scheduled against George Washington. Due to limited personnel, the Wahoos called the matchup off. After its nonconference slate ended, UVa announced that Nycerra Minnis and Tihana Stojsavljevic suffered season-ending injuries, and Dylan Horton opted out of the remainder of the season. Dani Lawson also was dealing with a significant leg injury for UVa. Virginia dealt with depth issues throughout the early months of the season, doing what it could to put enough players on the floor to compete. When it was on the court, UVa struggled. The Cavaliers went 0-5 in their extremely limited action this season, including a 0-2 mark in ACC action. Thompson\u2019s group isn\u2019t alone in opting out of the season. Duke became the first ACC program to make the decision, opting out of the season in late December due to health and safety concerns. \u201cThe student-athletes on the Duke women\u2019s basketball team have made the difficult decision to conclude their current season due to safety concerns,\u201d Michael Schoenfeld, the chief communications officer for Duke, said in December. \u201cWe support their decision, as we have supported the choices made by all student-athletes at Duke during this unprecedented time.\u201d Virginia decided to join Duke after a month of dealing with COVID-19 issues that led to postponements. \u201cThe health and safety of our student-athletes will always be the number one priority,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cWe will continue to focus on their overall well-being and prepare to resume competition in the fall.\u201d The decision does not impact the competition schedules of other UVa athletic programs, according to the school. This means the Cavaliers' men\u2019s basketball program and other UVa programs will continue on as scheduled.","713":"Tony Bennett received a text message after the Virginia men\u2019s basketball team\u2019s 70-61 home win over Wake Forest on Jan. 6. Nicole Levesque Andres, a former Wake Forest women\u2019s basketball star, WNBA player and wife of Bennett\u2019s former college teammate Mark Andres, attended the game with her daughter. She sent Bennett a message after the final buzzer sounded, letting the esteemed head coach know she and her daughter considered Chase Coleman the MVP of the game. Coleman didn\u2019t play a second for the Wahoos. \u201cShe said, \u2018The way he defended, the way he talked to his teammates and the way he encouraged all from the bench, was a great example to my daughter and to me of what a true team player is,\u2019\u201d Bennett said. Virginia\u2019s walk-on point guard didn\u2019t take the floor in the win, but he got into a defensive stance each time his teammates were on defense. His voice carried in the huddle as Bennett asked for opinions from players with multiple assistant coaches absent due to COVID-19 protocols. Chase, a sophomore with coaching aspirations, impressed those in attendance without ever shooting the ball, snatching a rebound or dishing out an assist. \u201cThat stuff will carry,\u201d Bennett said. \u201cThose are the lessons beyond the court that will carry on long term.\u201d Chase\u2019s impact from the sideline comes as no surprise to those closest to him. \u201cTo see his character on the bench, winning, losing, if he plays two minutes, if he plays five minutes, if he doesn\u2019t play at all, he\u2019s always involved in the game,\u201d said Matt Coleman, Chase\u2019s older brother and a standout point guard for Texas. \u201cHe\u2019s always been another coach on the bench.\u201d The early days Chase and Matt Coleman grew up playing point guard and leading their peers. They learned the game from their father, Cliff. A point guard during his playing days, Cliff is currently the head coach at Bryant & Stratton College, a junior college in Virginia Beach. He\u2019s coached since Chase and Matt were young, including a 19-year stint coaching for The Apprentice School in Newport News. He's also helped lead AAU teams. With a dad as a coach, the Coleman boys couldn\u2019t avoid learning the fundamentals and gravitating toward leadership roles within the game. \u201cIt\u2019s always been a part of me,\u201d Chase said. \u201cBack when I was growing up, I was the little kid playing on the drawboard and making my own plays and doing things like that so I think it\u2019s always been an interest of mine.\u201d The Coleman family owns plenty of photos of Chase coaching up his peers. In one photo, Chase is drawing up plays on a whiteboard and explaining them to a curly-haired guard. The talented guard with long blonde hair is current Wake Forest guard Carter Whitt, who arrived in Winston-Salem as a top-100 recruit. The two played on the same AAU team years ago. Coaching comes naturally to Chase, partially because Cliff taught him and Matt the basics of the game at a young age. As they got older and showed a knack for the sport, Cliff taught his sons the important traits of successful point guards. He taught them to be unselfish during games, making an emphasis to get everyone involved. Cliff stressed that being a good person outside of basketball mattered, too. \u201cIf you\u2019re a good teammate off the court, you\u2019ll be a better teammate on the court,\u201d Cliff said. Cliff wanted to impart his basketball wisdom on Chase and Matt. He wanted his sons to have a chance to take the floor consistently, and he knew they better be impressive for that to happen. \u201cIf you\u2019re gonna be a point guard, you got to have guys that want to play with you, so you got to find a way to have the guys enjoy playing with you,\u201d Cliff said. \u201cIf you can do that, that\u2019s a great attribute. On top of that, being a coach\u2019s son, you\u2019ve always gotta be as good as advertised. I want to play you, but I\u2019m only gonna play you if you\u2019re as good as advertised.\u201d As Chase and Matt developed their games through middle school and into high school, they earned any playing time they received, whether it was for Cliff or other coaches. They became two of the better players in the Virginia Beach area. Matt became a hot commodity on the recruiting circuit. His exceptional play in high school earned him significant interest and offers from programs across the country, including Duke and Kansas. He ultimately chose Texas. Matt is in his fourth season with the Longhorns, serving as the team\u2019s starting point guard every season since his arrival in Austin. Chase said his early high school days were focused on trying to create a name for himself on the court. \u201cI was just trying to get out of my brother\u2019s shadow,\u201d Chase said. \u201cThat was like my No. 1 thing because I knew how big of an athlete he was and how big his name was in the basketball world that I had to make a name for myself.\u201d His freshman and sophomore high school seasons were when he really committed to improving his game. He joked that video games became boring and basketball turned into his primary focus. With a newfound hunger for the game, Chase threw himself into competing. He\u2019s kept that edge since arriving at UVa. \u201cWhen we were like little kids, he did not want to be at the gym, and now, any chance we get to go to the gym, he\u2019s the first person there,\u201d Matt said. Chase\u2019s dedication to the game from the beginning of high school allowed the point guard to play an important role for Maury High School, which won a state championship in 2019, its first title since 1927. Coleman tallied five points, five rebounds and four assists in the state title game victory. \u201cAll his life people have doubted him because of his size,\u201d Matt said. \u201cEvery chance he gets he just rises to the occasion.\u201d The path to coaching Unlike his 6-foot-2 older brother, Chase didn\u2019t receive the same level of recruiting interest while in high school, in part due to him being just 5-foot-9. Despite the lack of Division I offers, Chase went to UVa and walked onto the men\u2019s basketball team for the defending national champions. By the time he arrived at UVa, Chase knew coaching was likely the path forward in basketball. \u201cEver since maybe high school, when I realized playing may not go the way that I really want it to\u00a0\u2014 but I knew my mind could take me to the places I wanted to be\u00a0\u2014 that\u2019s when I took more interest to it,\u201d Chase said. While being a walk-on was certainly an adjustment for the high school state champion, Chase\u2019s goals extend beyond playing time at UVa. Every day, whether at practices or games, Chase competes with the goal of helping teammates improve and potentially earning opportunities for himself. He also takes in lessons from Bennett and the rest of UVa\u2019s experienced staff, knowing the experience puts him closer to his coaching dreams. \u201cI know I get to learn from the best coaching staff probably in the United States,\u201d Chase said. \u201cEvery day I come in, and I\u2019m not really sure where it\u2019ll take me, but I know I\u2019m learning in the right places and it\u2019s taking me in the right direction.\u201d Chase\u2019s teammates and coaches rave about his selfless behavior. Trey Murphy III recently tweeted that Chase \u201cis definitely the best teammate that I\u2019ve ever had.\u201d Cliff was quick to credit his wife, Devona, for helping instill values in the two college point guards that make them selfless, team-first players. According to Cliff, there\u2019s no talking point or special emphasis on being selfless, it\u2019s just who the Colemans try to be every day through their family values. Being a walk-on for any program can be challenging to accept. Being a walk-on and primarily scout team player requires selflessness and an understanding of your role within your team. By all accounts, Chase embraces his role about as well as any player on UVa\u2019s roster. \u201cHe\u2019s just enjoying his process,\u201d Matt said. \u201cHe understands that his process is different than anybody else\u2019s. He\u2019s happy to be a Cavalier, and he knows that he\u2019s under the right culture and staff that\u2019s gonna lead him to his goal in life.\u201d Matt says he spoke with Chase over the offseason, when both players were home due to the COVID-19 protocols that ended the 2019-20 college basketball season early. The Texas star asked Chase if he considered playing somewhere other than UVa, especially with a couple of star recruits joining the mix at guard for Chase\u2019s sophomore season. According to Matt, Chase never flinched. \u201cHe was like, man, I like it here,\u201d Matt said. \u201cI\u2019m going to work every day.\u201d He\u2019s done just that. As fans watch Chase, they\u2019re impressed by the sophomore\u2019s attitude on the bench. Even without taking the floor, he knows he can impact his teammates and those in the stands or following at home on TV. \u201cI know that anybody can be watching at any moment,\u201d Chase said. \u201cYou never know what\u2019s really going on, so I feel like you can just be the best person you are, especially when it\u2019s out in the light. Good things will happen and good things will come to you.\u201d Among those also closely watching Chase\u2019s sideline demeanor is Cliff, the man who helped inspire Chase to dream about coaching. It\u2019s a change of pace to watch his son on the bench most games rather than the court, but he\u2019s grateful for Chase\u2019s role with the reigning national champions. He knows the coach\u2019s son is well on his way to becoming the coach. \u201cI\u2019ve learned to accept that role, and I just want to see my kids happy, and it seems like they are and he is for sure, so I\u2019m happy,\u201d Cliff said. \u201cI mean, of course you could ask for more, but what we have right now in front of us is pretty damn good.\u201d","714":"Clemson came into Saturday\u2019s showdown with Virginia as the top per-possession defense in college basketball. UVa, a program renowned for its defensive success, seemed to take that personally. Tony Bennett\u2019s squad waltzed into Littlejohn Coliseum and demolished Clemson, using an elite defensive performance and glorious 3-point shooting to beat the No. 12 Tigers. No. 18 Virginia (9-2, 5-0 ACC) held Clemson (9-2, 3-2 ACC) scoreless for more than 10 minutes in the first half and knocked down its first nine 3-pointers of the second half as it cruised to an 85-50 win. \u201cIt\u2019s fun, it\u2019s engaging, everybody\u2019s cheering up from the bench, energy just flows out your body,\u201d Virginia guard Tomas Woldetensae said of playing in a blowout win. \u201cIt\u2019s just a happy moment, especially now with COVID. It\u2019s enjoyable.\u201d Perhaps rusty from 10 days between games due to a COVID-19 pause, the Tigers went 11 minutes and 48 seconds between made shots in the first half. While rust certainly may have played a factor in the defeat, Virginia looked spectacular on both ends. Jay Huff found a cutting Kihei Clark at the rim for easy layups multiple times in the first half. Woldetensae came off the bench and reminded ACC foes and UVa fans what he\u2019s capable of from beyond the 3-point arc, finishing with 14 points and four made 3-pointers. \u201cI hope that it\u2019s a breakthrough,\u201d Woldetensae said of his performance. Ultimately, the Cavaliers reminded the conference why they were picked to win the league before the season began. Clemson made its first shot of the game when Aamir Simms scored in the post. After Simms\u2019 make, the Tigers went ice cold, going nearly 12 minutes before making another shot, and just over 10 minutes between points. Virginia opened up a 20-3 lead when Huff pivoted in the post and slammed a ball through the hoop with his right hand. UVa stretched the lead to 31-7 after a pair of Clark free throws, leading by 24 at the final media timeout of the first half. Fortunately for Clemson, a 10-0 run that stretched into the opening minute of the second half pulled the Tigers within 14 points. With the game seemingly close to becoming competitive, the Wahoos ripped off a 10-0 run of its own to grab a 43-19 lead. The dominance only continued from there. \u201cWe didn\u2019t take our foot off the gas, and we were for the most part sound and made Clemson earn their baskets,\u201d Bennett said. UVa made its first nine 3-points shots of the second half, stretching the lead to 70-37 after a Woldetensae 3-pointer. A couple possessions later, Reece Beekman stole a pass and slammed home a dunk to put Virginia up 76-37 and force a Clemson timeout. \u201cWhen things are going like that, it\u2019s very contagious,\u201d said Virginia forward Sam Hauser, who scored 14 points and went 4-of-5 from 3-point range. \u201cI think guys coming off the bench and even guys on the floor at the time, once they saw other people making shots they could get more confidence to shoot and take good shots.\u201d Clark and Beekman were among those who were phenomenal for UVa. The two point guards combined to score 20 points on 9-of-14 shooting while adding 11 assists to just one turnover. As a team, UVa tallied 22 assists, its first 20-assist showing in an ACC game since a 79-53 win over Syracuse in March of 2019. Eventually, the Cavaliers did miss a second-half 3-pointer, but the outcome was never in doubt Saturday night. The last time Virginia played a ranked team, it lost by 23 points to No. 1 Gonzaga. Bennett called his team \u201coverwhelmed.\u201d Saturday, against No. 12 Clemson, the Wahoos overwhelmed the top-ranked defense in the country. They showed why they entered the season as a top-5 team as they delivered on both ends of the floor. UVa sent a clear message to the ACC that it\u2019s still the team to beat. \u201cObviously you take a hard punch to the face from Gonzaga, it\u2019s hard to get up from that, but you learn, you live, you move on,\u201d Hauser said, \u201cand I think we\u2019ve taken some great strides.\u201d","715":"The Virginia men\u2019s and women\u2019s swimming and diving teams both picked up dual meet victories over Virginia Tech on Saturday at the UVa Aquatic and Fitness Center. The No. 2 UVa women\u2019s swimming and diving team defeated No. 15 Virginia Tech 202.5-96.5, while the No. 10 Cavalier men\u2019s team defeated the No. 15 Hokies 161-137. The Wahoos won 23 events throughout the day, including sweeping both relay events. Eight different female swimmers and five male swimmers won an individual event during the competition. \u201cI continue to be amazed at the commitment and resiliency of this team,\u201d said Virginia coach Todd DeSorbo, who did not coach during the meet due to COVID-19 protocols. \u201cTo come out and perform at a high level every day in practice and on the weekend in competition is a true testament of their commitment to excellence. With both myself and head diving coach [Drew] Livingston out this week, I have to tip my hat to the rest of the staff for stepping up in our absence. This shows how great our staff really is.\u201d The UVa women won 13 of 14 races on Saturday. Sophomore Kate Douglass led the Wahoos with three individual wins and one relay victory, going 53.35 in the 100-yard backstroke, 48.80 in the 100-yard freestyle and 1:57.05 in the 200-yard individual medley. Douglass was the leadoff swimmer for the 200-yard medley relay team as she and teammates Alex Walsh, Caroline Gmelich and Lexi Cuomo finished first with a time of 1:38.85. Maddie Donohoe picked up a pair of wins, touching the wall first in the 500-yard freesyle (4:51.44) and the 1,000-yard freestyle (9:54.66). Matthew Otto, Justin Grender and Matt Brownstead paced the Virginia men\u2019s team. All three Cavaliers won a pair of individual events. Otto won the 1,000-yard freestyle in a time of 9:16.91, before following up the performance with a time of 1:57.72 in the 200-yard breaststroke. Grender swept the backstroke events, going 47.68 in the 100-yard backstroke and 1:43.96 in the 200-yard backstroke, while Brownstead recorded a time of 19.99 in the 50-yard freestyle and a time of 43.91 in the 100-yard freestyle. Caldwell wins long jump title Virginia\u2019s Khyasia Caldwell won the long jump by five inches at the Virginia Tech Invitational on Saturday. A 2020 All-American in the event, Caldwell recorded a jump of 6.09m (19\u201911.75\u201d), the NCAA\u2019s fourth-best jump so far this season. Maria Deaviz also earned a first-place finish in a field event, capturing the top mark in the shot put at 15.43m (50\u20197.5\u201d). The men\u2019s distance medley relay team of Randy Neish, Brandon Outlaw, Conor Murphy and Wes Porter turned in a time of 9:48.73 as the quartet ran the race uncontested. Keara Seasholtz ran a time of 2:12.07 to win the 800m, while Jay Pendarvis recorded the top time in the men\u2019s 200m at 22.46. Additionally, Rebecca Hawkins cleared a height of 1.74m (5\u20198.5\u201d) to finish second in the high jump, while Claudio Romero recorded a mark of 18.44m (60\u20196\u201d) to finish second in the shot put. \u201cThe women\u2019s team showed great promise with Khyasia Caldwell and Rebecca Hawkins in the jumps,\u201d Virginia director of track & field and cross country\/associate athletics director of administration Vin Lananna said. \u201cMaria Deaviz had a freshman record in the shot. Claudio Romero\u2019s big personal record in the shot coupled with a good solo effort in the distance medley bolstered the men\u2019s weekend.\u201d","716":"The Virginia men\u2019s basketball team\u2019s matchup with N.C. State, which was scheduled for Wednesday, has been postponed, the ACC announced Sunday. The decision comes as the Wolfpack deals with COVID-19 issues within their program. The news adds to the list of ACC postponements for UVa. The Cavaliers still need to make up a road game at Wake Forest as well as a home game with Virginia Tech. Not playing N.C. State on Wednesday means the Cavaliers have three conference games to make up by the end of the season in order to play a full 20-game ACC schedule. With an empty date Wednesday, there\u2019s a chance UVa adds an opponent to the schedule. It\u2019s unclear if another ACC opponent might become available or if the Wahoos could choose to add a nonconference game this week. UVa could also opt to not play this week, instead using the extra time to prepare for Saturday\u2019s game with Georgia Tech. Given the flexibility shown by teams with scheduling this season, plenty of options are available for Virginia. When UVa returns to the court, the Cavaliers hope to build on their 9-2 record and 5-0 mark in ACC play. The team is riding a five-game winning streak, and they knocked off No. 12 Clemson 85-50 in a dominant performance Saturday.","717":"The Virginia men\u2019s basketball team played arguably its best game of the season Saturday, demolishing Clemson in an 85-50 victory. Tony Bennett\u2019s team played sound defense and excelled offensively, shooting a shade over 60% from the floor. It was a dominant victory against a Clemson team that\u2019s among the best in the ACC. Even with a 10-day break between games and only three practices to prepare for UVa, Clemson head coach Brad Brownell wasn\u2019t using that as an excuse for his team\u2019s loss to the Wahoos. \u201cWhen they\u2019re playing as good as they played, we could have practiced 10 days in a row and it wouldn\u2019t have mattered,\u201d Brownell said. \u201cWe still would\u2019ve lost by 15.\u201d UVa opened the game on a 20-3 run, then quickly extended its lead to more than 20 points in the second half and ran away with the game. \u201cVirginia smashed us,\u201d Brownell said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t play well. We didn\u2019t coach well. To be honest with you, we gave in.\u201d Unfortunately for UVa, they\u2019ll have to wait to continue their impressive play. Wednesday\u2019s scheduled game against N.C. State was postponed due to COVID-19 issues within N.C. State\u2019s program. As of Monday at noon, Bennett doesn\u2019t anticipate the Wahoos adding a new team to the schedule despite frequent discussions regarding schedule alterations. \u201cJust the way it landed, this is where it\u2019s at, so we\u2019ll play Saturday-Monday coming up here as opposed to this Wednesday,\u201d Bennett said. Virginia hosts Georgia Tech on Saturday at 8 p.m. before welcoming Syracuse to town two days later at 7 p.m. Ranking update The stellar showing against Clemson shot UVa up a few different rankings. In the AP poll, UVa climbed to No. 13. That marks a five-spot jump from the previous week. Interestingly, Monday marked the 50-year anniversary of UVa\u2019s men\u2019s basketball program being ranked for the first time. The Cavaliers entered the AP poll at No. 19 on Jan. 18, 1971. That came a week after UVa upset a top-10 South Carolina team thanks to a game-winning shot from Barry Parkhill. Virginia also improved in the NET rankings. The win over Clemson moved UVa up 23 spots to No. 10 in the NET rankings as of Monday morning. The Cavaliers are the highest ranked ACC team in the NET and AP poll. At 9-2 overall and 5-0 in the ACC, UVa is the lone ACC team still undefeated in conference play. Kadin Shedrick\u2019s status Talented redshirt freshman Kadin Shedrick has missed three consecutive games with an undisclosed health issue unrelated to COVID-19. Bennett isn\u2019t quite sure when Shedrick will return. \u201cWe\u2019re hopeful, but I haven\u2019t gotten any updates recently,\u201d Bennett said. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of the same thing. We\u2019re waiting just to get some more results and he seems like he\u2019s feeling better, but it\u2019s been frustrating for him.\u201d When Shedrick does become healthy, he\u2019ll likely help back up Jay Huff. Francisco Caffaro has stepped in recently with Shedrick out, playing at least 12 minutes in each of the last two games. Vaccinations In positive news, some ACC men\u2019s basketball coaches have started receiving the COVID-19 vaccine. Miami\u2019s Jim Larranaga and Duke\u2019s Mike Krzyzewski both shared Monday that they\u2019ve received their first dose of the vaccine. UNC head coach Roy Williams says he expects to receive his first dose of the vaccine toward the end of next week. Larranaga and Krzyzewski expect to receive their second dose of the vaccine in early February. Krzyzewski, Larranaga and Williams are all at least 70 years old.","718":"With an influx of UVa players joining the NBA, it\u2019s become more challenging for head coach Tony Bennett to keep track of his former players and their professional endeavors. \u201cThe more guys you get in the league, it\u2019s a good thing, it\u2019s also a bad thing because you can\u2019t keep up with all of it,\u201d Bennett smiled. Bennett\u2019s former players have seen plenty of opportunity to start the 2020-21 NBA season. Malcolm Brogdon is playing the best basketball of his career and is capable of making the All-Star team this season. Joe Harris\u2019 Brooklyn Nets possess one of the most talented rosters in the NBA after the addition of James Harden via trade. Harris is in an ideal spot to contend for a championship. Other players, such as Philadelphia\u2019s Mike Scott, help their teams in smaller yet important roles. There are also a few youngsters from UVa\u2019s national championship team competing for minutes. De\u2019Andre Hunter is a budding star for the Atlanta Hawks, while Ty Jerome is hoping to earn a role in Oklahoma City. Kyle Guy finds himself in a similar position in Sacramento. Mamadi Diakite is a two-way player for the Milwaukee Bucks. He hasn\u2019t played in the NBA this season. \u201cEarly on in their career, I always try to watch, especially in those first opportunities, and then when they become a little more seasoned I maybe let it slide a little more and I can\u2019t keep up with them,\u201d Bennett said. \u201cI figure they\u2019re OK, they\u2019re on their way, and they don\u2019t need an old coach watching them.\u201d When Bennett\u2019s schedule offers some free time, he does like to keep tabs on his former players. Sometimes that means tuning into games. Other times, he\u2019ll rely on box scores to keep track. \u201cIt brings me such joy because I know how hard they work, and it\u2019s certainly a dream of theirs coming true,\u201d Bennett said. Let\u2019s take a look at the recent performances of former UVa standouts in the NBA this season. Malcolm Brogdon Brogdon is putting up fantastic stats for an Indiana Pacers team looking to pose a threat to the top teams in the Eastern Conference. The former UVa star is averaging 22.2 points and 7.5 assists per night this season. Both totals would be career-high marks should Brogdon maintain that pace. Unfortunately for Brogdon, the team traded away Victor Oladipo in recent days. The Pacers received Caris LeVert from the Nets as part of the blockbuster trade that also involved Houston sending Harden to the Nets. During the physical examination of LeVert as part of the trade, a mass was discovered on his kidney. He\u2019s currently unavailable to play as he undergoes further medical exams. Indiana hopes LeVert gets healthy soon and they\u2019re able to work him into the team. In the meantime, Brogdon will remain a focal point of Indiana\u2019s plans. Joe Harris Harris drained a key 3-pointer in the Nets\u2019 victory over Milwaukee on Monday. He\u2019s looked good since Harden arrived in Brooklyn, playing well alongside him and Kevin Durant. \u201cBig time,\u201d Harden said of Harris\u2019 clutch fourth-quarter shot in a two-point win. \u201cI think throughout the course of the year we want to put confidence in each and every one of our players from top to bottom, because at any given moment somebody can step up and make big plays.\u201d Kyrie Irving has missed significant time recently in part due to a mandatory COVID-19 quarantine. It\u2019s unclear how Harris will factor into the offense with Durant, Harden and Irving all receiving minutes, but he\u2019s still likely to receive important playing time and shot attempts. Harris has scored at least nine points in every game this season, and he\u2019s scored 10 points or more in 13 consecutive games. He\u2019s shooting 51.1% from 3-point range this season and averaging 15 points per game. De\u2019Andre Hunter Hunter is developing into a force in his second NBA season. He\u2019s reached at least 10 points in all 13 games this season, and he scored 25 points Monday in an 11-point win over Minnesota. He went 8-of-15 from the floor while also grabbing four rebounds and adding three steals. Hunter told reporters after the game he\u2019s making a bigger effort to attack the basket this season. \u201cI feel I settled a lot last year,\u201d Hunter said. Interestingly, the mild-mannered Hunter received a technical foul in Monday\u2019s victory. He said he was frustrated with a foul called on him and believes he\u2019s often fouled on offense but refs don\u2019t call it. Monday, his frustration came to the surface. \u201cIt\u2019s been happening almost every game,\u201d Hunter said. \u201cI was kind of fed up.\u201d His teammates and coaches had no issue with the technical. The liked the fire from the youngster. \u201cIt\u2019s good for him, especially for a guy like him who doesn\u2019t necessarily express himself,\u201d center Clint Capela said. \u201cI think it\u2019s good he got it out and even let the refs, the league know his presence.\u201d Capela loves what he\u2019s season from the second-year professional on both ends of the court. Hunter is averaging 16.7 points and 6.2 rebounds per game this season while shooting 50.3% from the field. \u201cHe has a chance to be really special,\u201d Capela said. Mike Scott Scott has dealt with injury issues this season, and he\u2019s missed some time due to knee issues. When Scott is healthy, he\u2019s been a role player off the bench for the 76ers. The Philadelphia forward did receive a couple starts this season, however, and he played a massive role in the team\u2019s win over Miami on Jan. 12. He played 46 minutes in a starting role, scoring 16 points and contributing three rebounds. \u201cStill definitely room for improvement,\u201d Scott said. \u201cCan rebound better. Can work on shot selection. I don\u2019t think I did great, but I\u2019m glad we won.\u201d When healthy, he\u2019s certainly involved as a piece of Philadelphia\u2019s plan. Ty Jerome The second-year guard is nursing a sprained left ankle and hasn\u2019t played this season for the Oklahoma City Thunder. It\u2019s unclear when he might become available for Oklahoma City. Jerome was traded to the Thunder this offseason from the Phoenix Suns. He played in 31 games for the Suns as a rookie. Kyle Guy Another second-year player, Guy is seeking additional playing time for the Sacramento Kings. While Guy isn\u2019t currently a part of Sacramento\u2019s rotation, he\u2019s played in four NBA games this season. That\u2019s more action this season than he saw at the NBA level all of last season. In his four games, Guy has scored 15 points on 4-of-14 shooting. He\u2019s added seven assists without yet turning the ball over. Anthony Gill After playing overseas, Gill joined the Washington Wizards this offseason. He\u2019s another former UVa player seeing limited minutes across four games. In his latest game, he scored four points against Phoenix on Jan. 11. Unfortunately, the Wizards are dealing with significant COVID-19 issues and haven\u2019t played since the win over Phoenix.","719":"Virginia men\u2019s soccer player Bret Halsey has signed a Generation adidas contract with Major League Soccer, the league announced on Tuesday. Generation adidas is a joint program between MLS and adidas which sees a handful of top collegiate underclassmen and youth national team players signed by MLS to Generation adidas contracts and made available in the MLS SuperDraft. The junior midfielder becomes the fifth former Cavalier to enter their name into this year\u2019s MLS SuperDraft, which will take place on Thursday beginning at 2 p.m. Halsey joins teammates Nathaniel Crofts, Irakoze Donasiyano and Colin Shutler as eligible Cavaliers for the 2021 SuperDraft. Former UVa midfielder, Daniel Steedman also is eligible after spending the 2020 season playing with Atlanta United 2. Halsey has been a staple in the Virginia lineup since the 2019 season, when the Cavaliers won their 16h ACC championship and reached the NCAA College Cup Final. He has started all 31 matches in which he has appeared over the course of three seasons, including his final 27 matches. Halsey played every minute of all eight UVa matches this fall. Halsey becomes the fourth Virginia player to sign a Generation adidas contract since the 2017 season, joining Edward Opoku, Henry Kessler and Daryl Dike. Cavaliers place ninth in opener The Virginia men\u2019s golf team finished ninth at the Camp Creek Seminole Invitational to open its 2021 season. It was UVa\u2019s first event since last March. The Cavaliers shot 8-over 295 during the final round for a three-day total of 885. Wake Forest and Florida State tied for the tournament title at 22-under 842. The 10-team field was made up of ACC programs. Freshman George Duangmanee led the Cavaliers during the final round, shooting 1-under 71 to finish in 49th place in his collegiate debut. Duangmanee started play Sunday with a score of 84 but rebounded to shoot a combined 2-under for the final two rounds of the tournament. The team\u2019s top overall finisher was Pietro Bovari, who placed 31st overall at 4-over 220. He opened play with a 72 and shot 2-over 74 during each of the final two rounds. It marked the second consecutive tournament Bovari has led the team in scoring. He was UVa\u2019s top finisher at the Palmetto Intercollegiate in March, the Cavaliers\u2019 last event in 2020 before the schedule was suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Clemson\u2019s Jacob Bridgeman took medalist honors. He used an opening-round 64 to lead the event from the start and finished at 15-under 201. The Cavaliers return to action Jan. 25 when they play in the two-day Timaquana Collegiate in Jacksonville, Fla.","720":"With Casey Morsell unavailable due to COVID-19 protocols, Tony Bennett used a dual-point-guard lineup in Virginia\u2019s Jan. 6 matchup with Wake Forest. The head coach may have found something in the win. The starting lineup, which features Kihei Clark and Reece Beekman at guard, has stuck in the three ACC games since, and it\u2019s working well. The Cavaliers have reached at least 80 points in consecutive conference games, achieving that feat for the first time under Bennett\u2019s watch. Trey Murphy, Sam Hauser and Jay Huff provide height, length and shooting alongside the two guards. The entire group plays well together, and it\u2019s leading to results. \u201cI think there\u2019s a little more of a feel for OK, this is the group that\u2019s playing,\u201d Bennett said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean that eight and nine can\u2019t get some opportunities in our rotation.\u201d Finding a consistent starting lineup enables Bennett to shorten his rotation. The smaller rotation \u2014 eight players earned at least 10 minutes against Clemson \u2014 helps generate increased competition in practice as players fight for a spot in the lineup. \u201cGuys are stepping up and practices have been pretty competitive,\u201d Bennett said. \u201cJust trying to be as no-nonsense and hard-nosed as we can to keep getting better.\u201d Among those fighting for increased time are Morsell and Tomas Woldetensae. They offer valuable experience and skill at the guard position, but they need to produce to earn minutes over someone like Beekman. Morsell, known best for his on-ball defense, returned from a COVID-19 close contact quarantine with a 15-point outing against Notre Dame. The highly recruited sophomore followed that up with 20 minutes off the bench against Clemson, scoring five points. After shooting just 27.7% from the field last season, Morsell\u2019s shooting percentage is sitting at 46.2% this season. The quality defense remains, and the guard has developed into a potential scoring option rather than an offensive liability. Woldetensae excelled against Clemson, matching the team-high with 14 points on 5-of-7 shooting. He also contributed five rebounds. The performance came after Woldetensae didn\u2019t score a point in the first four ACC games of the season. He only took four shots in ACC action prior to Saturday\u2019s outburst. The Italian sharpshooter said after the game he\u2019s leaned on Bennett\u2019s message of staying ready. \u201cEvery time after a game where somebody did not play as much, he would mention it, just to be ready and stay with the team, united,\u201d Woldetensae said. \u201cIt\u2019s, of course, something that you like to hear, especially coming from not playing in a game or so. You just stick to improving and trust the process.\u201d Last season, Woldetensae started slowly before developing into one of UVa\u2019s most dynamic offensive threats. He didn\u2019t score 15 or more points until ACC play last season, but reached the mark three times in conference games. He dropped 27 points at Louisville and buried a game-winning shot at North Carolina. Woldetensae hopes Saturday\u2019s showing is a sign of things to come. \u201cYou have teammates that have your back and at that point, you just show up to play,\u201d Woldetensae said. \u201cLast year, I struggled the first half of the season and I hope now that we passed that struggling moment, we can move forward with a better angle, especially maybe playing in March Madness.\u201d Virginia\u2019s lineup of Clark, Beekman, Murphy, Hauser and Huff seems like a reliable starting five. They are a key reason why Virginia remains undefeated in ACC action. The Cavaliers\u2019 bench, however, has shown the ability to step up in recent games. Even with a shortened rotation, depth remains on UVa\u2019s sideline. That will only increase when forward Kadin Shedrick and guard Kody Stattmann return to full health. The starting unit deserves significant credit for UVa\u2019s recent success, but role players off the bench make UVa all the more dangerous. \u201cThe more balance we can have, the more contributions off of that bench is significant because I have been playing those five guys a lot of minutes,\u201d Bennett said.","721":"Josh Pastner rarely passes up a chance to praise Tony Bennett or the Virginia men\u2019s basketball program. Last season, Georgia Tech\u2019s head coach told the media he thought Bennett deserved a statue outside of John Paul Jones Arena. On Friday, he said Bennett should be in the Hall of Fame immediately. Monday, he told reporters UVa\u2019s effort in its 85-50 victory over Clemson was good enough to beat anyone in the country. \u201cVirginia would\u2019ve beaten Gonzaga on Saturday,\u201d Pastner said. \u201cIt really wasn\u2019t a Clemson deal. Clemson is a very good team. I don\u2019t care if Clemson was playing their A-game, Virginia probably would\u2019ve won that game. They were just incredible.\u201d While Pastner consistently shows respect to the reigning national champions, his squad holds the tools to beat the program he admires. The surging Yellow Jackets, who have won five games in a row and seven of their last eight games, will get their chance Saturday night when they come to JPJ Arena for an 8 p.m. tipoff on the ACC Network. Georgia Tech played Clemson on Wednesday, winning 83-65 after a 17-day break between games due to COVID-19 protocols. The Yellow Jackets even one-upped Virginia, making 16 3-pointers against Clemson a game after UVa knocked down 15 on the Tigers\u2019 vaunted defense. Georgia Tech made 61.5% of its 3-point attempts in the win over Clemson. \u201cIf we could shoot like that every game, I really like our chances every time we play,\u201d Pastner said with a smile. \u201cIf we want to have a good chance to beat Virginia we might need to shoot 61.5% for 3.\u201d The remark represents perhaps another example of hyperbole from Pastner, but Georgia Tech will need its best effort to beat a confident Virginia team. The Cavaliers improved to 5-0 in the ACC with their win over Clemson. Each of UVa\u2019s five conference wins came by at least nine points, and the last three victories in ACC action came by 12 points or more. Since ACC play began, UVa leads the league in offensive efficiency and ranks second in defensive efficiency, per KenPom. Virginia ranks in the top 10 nationally in both offensive and defensive efficiency. \u201cWhen you combine good defense, efficient defense, with efficient offense, that\u2019s the great recipe,\u201d Bennett said on his Monday radio show. Bennett\u2019s team also spent the entire week preparing for the Yellow Jackets after Wednesday\u2019s scheduled game with N.C. State was postponed on Sunday. That gave UVa time to work on a plan for a dynamic Georgia Tech lineup that features three players under 6-foot-6 and no starters over 6-10. In years past, Georgia Tech was accustomed to an All-ACC caliber player at the center position. This year, the Yellow Jackets use a smaller lineup \u2014 with 6-9 Moses Wright at the center spot \u2014 designed to force turnovers. It works well. Georgia Tech leads the conference in defensive turnover percentage during ACC play, generating turnovers on 25.8% of opponents\u2019 possessions. Jose Alvarado, a senior guard, ranks second in the ACC in steals per game with 2.3. Alvarado snatched four takeaways against Clemson. Bennett noted Monday that the Yellow Jackets mix and match defenses well, changing up looks to thwart opposing offenses. \u201cThey\u2019ve confused a lot of people with their defense,\u201d Bennett said. \u201cIt\u2019s always been tricky.\u201d UVa, on the other hand, leads the ACC in offensive turnover percentage, only giving the ball away on 11% of its possessions during five ACC games. \u201cWe know Virginia obviously won\u2019t beat itself,\u201d Alvarado said. A failure to force turnovers would leave an undersized Georgia Tech team attempting to guard a Virginia team shooting 60.4% from inside the 3-point line during conference play. Clemson shot over 50% from the field in its 18-point loss to Georgia Tech, but an abundance of forced turnovers helped the Yellow Jackets hold the Tigers to 65 points. Georgia Tech will need to contain 7-footer Jay Huff, who went for 17 points, eight rebounds and six blocks when these two teams met last season. \u201cI thought he was really good last year, and I think he\u2019s really good this year,\u201d Pastner said. \u201cI think he\u2019s an NBA prospect. He\u2019s gonna play in the NBA.\u201d As Pastner praises the Cavaliers, his group enters Saturday night\u2019s showdown as one of the ACC\u2019s hottest teams. They lead the league in scoring at 80.4 points per game, and they\u2019ve won their last three ACC games by an average of 13 points. Like UVa, Georgia Tech comes into the game after steamrolling Clemson. The Yellow Jackets respect UVa, but they\u2019re far from scared. \u201cWe\u2019re just gonna go out there and give them a fight,\u201d Alvarado said. \u201cThey gotta worry about us too.\u201d","722":"Sam Hauser caught fire from 3-point range and Kihei Clark tossed alley-oop pass after alley-oop pass to delight the limited fans in attendance at John Paul Jones Arena on Monday night. Defensively, UVa lived up to its program standard with a solid showing. Aside from its 85-50 blowout victory over Clemson, Monday\u2019s 81-58 win over Syracuse might\u2019ve been the most complete team performance of the season for No. 8 Virginia (11-2, 7-0 ACC). Tony Bennett\u2019s team looked the part of an ACC title contender, showcasing offensive balance and defensive excellence in a blowout victory of Jim Beoheim\u2019s squad. Plenty stood out from the win, including these three areas. Clark leads passing display Clark spearheaded impressive team-wide passing. Despite not scoring much \u2014 Clark finished with just four points \u2014 UVa\u2019s point guard stressed the Syracuse 2-3 zone with tremendous passing. Clark received the ball in the middle of the zone and frequently found shooters on the outside for open looks. The quickness of Clark proved challenging to stop for the Orange, and he kept mistakes to a minimum. He racked up nine assists compared to just two turnovers. That outing comes a game after he finished with eight assists to just three turnovers against Georgia Tech. As a team, Virginia tallied 23 assists on its 29 made shots. The team\u2019s ball movement was ideal, as they picked apart the Syracuse zone. Hauser heater Hauser discussed being in a slump earlier this season, saying his 3-point shot wasn\u2019t quite up to his lofty standards. The Marquette transfer has seemed to regain his rhythm against Clemson, knocking down four of his five shots from beyond the arc. Hauser matched those numbers Saturday against Georgia Tech, knocking down four of his five attempted 3-pointers, including crucial made shots down the stretch of the narrow win over the Yellow Jackets. Monday, Hauser tied his career-high with seven made 3-point shots. He tied Jay Huff for the team lead with 21 points. Hauser made seven of his 13 shots from 3-point range, making him 15-for-23 (65.2%) from 3-point range in his last three games. When Hauser shots that efficiently, UVa\u2019s offense hits a new level. UVa leans into starting rotation Virginia\u2019s starting lineup of Kihei Clark, Reece Beekman, Trey Murphy, Sam Hauser and Jay Huff came into existence in part due to Casey Morsell missing 10 days at the beginning of ACC play due to COVID-19 contact tracing protocols. The lineup has stuck since. The group gives UVa two point guards in Beekman and Clark, while Hauser and Murphy provide length and shooting along the wing. Huff gives Virginia a versatile 7-footer on offense and a rim protector on defense. Everyone in the starting five is playing their individual role well. Monday, Clark and Beekman combined for 14 assists and only turned the ball over four times. Hauser and Murphy combined to make 11 shots from beyond the 3-point line. Huff scored a career-best 21 points, while also snagging 12 rebounds. Bench players have stepped up nicely in recent games for the Wahoos, but it\u2019s elite play from the starting unit that\u2019s helping UVa surge to the top of the conference standings.","723":"Virginia completed a late-January NCAA Tournament simulation Monday night at John Paul Jones Arena. Impressive doesn\u2019t begin to describe. Playing for the second time in three nights, the same rhythm they\u2019ll encounter in the NCAA Tournament, the No. 8 Cavaliers led by double-figure margins for the final 19 minutes in an 81-58 dusting of Syracuse. If Sam Hauser (21 points and seven rebounds) wasn\u2019t making one of his seven 3-pointers, Jay Huff (career-high 21 points and 12 boards) was elevating for one of his six dunks. If Kihei Clark (nine assists) wasn\u2019t making a sage pass, often a lob to Huff, he was disrupting the Orange offense. Monday\u2019s victory, Virginia\u2019s seventh straight since a 98-75 loss to No. 1 Gonzaga, came 48 hours after a 64-62 home win over Georgia Tech. As Georgia Tech did Saturday, Syracuse arrived at JPJ leading the ACC in scoring. Averaging 79 points, the Orange had shot better than 50% from the floor in back-to-back routs of Miami and Virginia Tech, the latter on Saturday at the Carrier Dome. Not Monday. Syracuse (9-5, 3-4 ACC) shot 37.3% and missed 19-of-24 attempts beyond the 3-point arc. Conversely, Virginia (11-2, 7-0) shot 49.2% and had 23 assists on 29 field goals, a tribute to spacing, ball movement and selflessness. \u201cI thought it felt right,\u201d Cavaliers coach Tony Bennett said of the offense. \u201cPlaying with unselfish guys is awesome,\u201d Hauser said, \u201cand it showed tonight.\u201d Routine in the Pac-12, Bennett\u2019s previous coaching home, two league games in three days are unusual in the ACC. But the NCAA Tournament similarity adds intrigue to the results. Not surprising given the program\u2019s excellence, Virginia has thrived in rapid turnarounds. The Cavaliers were 6-1 in ACC games with one day\u2019s rest from 2018-20, including 3-0 during their 2019 run to the national championship. All on the road, those 2019 victories were over No. 8 North Carolina, No. 20 Virginia Tech and Syracuse, the first following a home setback to No. 2 Duke. Bennett said he stressed to the Cavaliers that \u201cif you\u2019re fortunate to make an NCAA Tournament, this is how it is,\u201d and that he was especially concerned with the short preparation time because players such as Hauser, Reece Beekman and Trey Murphy had not competed against Syracuse\u2019s trademark 2-3 zone defense. But the trio combined for 47 points on 15-of-33 shooting. There\u2019s so much to like about Virginia\u2019s more aggressive approach to offense and its quality depth. For example, off a Clark steal, Beekman forced the issue in transition and made a contested layup for a 16-8 lead. A few moments later, Murphy swiped a Buddy Boeheim pass, a turnover Hauser converted with a fast-break 3-pointer off a Clark assist. UVa\u2019s willingness \u2014 dare we say occasional desire? \u2014 to run doesn\u2019t always pan out, witness Clark\u2019s missed pull-up from 15 feet after a Huff steal. But the shot was open, and I\u2019ll bet Bennett didn\u2019t scold him for taking it. Don\u2019t misunderstand. For the fifth consecutive year, the Cavaliers are playing at the nation\u2019s slowest pace, according to KenPom.com, a function of patient offense and stifling defense. And while this is not a vintage Bennett defense, Virginia has been among the top 10 nationally in defensive efficiency for most of the season. Driving home the point: On back-to-back Syracuse possessions midway through the second half, Murphy and Huff not only blocked shots, but also recovered the subsequent loose balls. \u201cI think we\u2019re guarding the ball better,\u201d Bennett said, citing Beekman as a primary reason. A 6-foot-3 freshman, Beekman\u2019s 22 steals are 15 more than any other Cavalier. On deck for Virginia, COVID-19 willing, is the year\u2019s first UVa-Virginia Tech clash, Saturday at Cassell Coliseum. Alas, it may be the sole encounter between the state\u2019s ACC programs this season. Virus concerns within the Cavaliers\u2019 program scrubbed the rivals\u2019 Jan. 2 date at JPJ, and the game has yet to be rescheduled. Among UVa\u2019s three postponed league contests, and Virginia Tech\u2019s two, surely this one is Priority A, but finding a date amenable to both may prove difficult. Come mid-February, again if the pandemic cooperates, Virginia will face another Saturday-Monday turnaround, with a home game against North Carolina and a road trip to Florida State. That\u2019s a Sweet 16-Elite Eight challenge, one that will reveal even more about these Cavaliers. David Teel reports for the Richmond Times-Dispatch.","724":"Growing up a coach\u2019s son, Jeff Capel never understood why basketball coaches wore suits and baseball managers dressed like they were about to start at shortstop. Neither game-day outfit seemed appropriate to him. \u201cWhen I was younger, I used to ask my dad all the time, \u2018Why is it only basketball coaches that have to wear suits?\u2019\u201d Capel, Pittsburgh\u2019s head men\u2019s basketball coach, said. \u201cI\u2019ve also never understood why the hell a baseball manager has to wear a uniform. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good look either for some of these managers.\u201d Fortunately for Capel, he hasn\u2019t needed to wear a suit this season. ACC men\u2019s basketball coaches agreed before the season to wear more casual clothing, with many coaches grabbing polos out of their closets rather than designer suits. UVa head coach Tony Bennett agrees with Capel\u2019s sentiment. Despite showing up on internet lists of the best-dressed and most handsome coaches, Bennett much prefers the casual attire he\u2019s worn this season to the suits in years past. \u201cThere\u2019s no way that coaches should ever go back to wearing suits,\u201d Bennett said recently on his radio show. \u201cCome on. We\u2019re basketball coaches. We\u2019re not curing anything important.\u201d Bennett typically has worn a Virginia polo or quarter zip on the sideline this season to go with khakis. His assistant coaches do the same. The change is a welcomed one for Bennett, who wore a suit and tie at the beginning of his UVa tenure in part due to the suggestion of then athletic director Craig Littlepage. He ditched the tie in recent seasons, wearing a dress shirt and sport coat. This season, he\u2019s joined his ACC peers by letting loose and wearing team-issued polos. It\u2019s a change he\u2019s hoped for since the beginning of his time at Virginia. \u201cI\u2019m like, if we ever can get good enough, I\u2019d love it if I would never have to wear a tie,\u201d Bennett said. \u201cLittlepage was like, \u2018Ah, it\u2019d be good.\u2019 And the other thing was that we could keep the lights on and just get to playing the game instead of all the nonsense.\u201d Some of the \u201cnonsense\u201d is gone this year, too. There\u2019s significantly less activity geared toward fans than in previous seasons due to limited attendance figures, but it\u2019s unlikely the pregame pageantry at John Paul Jones Arena is gone for good. When fans return in droves, expect plenty of festivities ranging from hype videos to lengthy and dramatic player introductions before tipoff. Wearing suits on the sideline, however, could be a thing of the past for Bennett and ACC coaches. Wake Forest head coach Steve Forbes chuckled at the notion that he might be in a hurry for coaches to return to wearing suits. The new ACC coach spoke on a Monday teleconference while wearing a Wake Forest hoodie. \u201cDo I look like a person who would miss wearing suits?\u201d asked Forbes. \u201cI mean, come on, man. I got the Belichick look going on today.\u201d A few coaches, including Boston College\u2019s Jim Christian, said the change makes perfect sense this season with games feeling almost like practices or scrimmages due to the lack of attendance stemming from COVID-19 restrictions. Georgia Tech\u2019s Josh Pastner says he\u2019s not one for dressing up, although his wife misses the formal attire since game days were the only time he\u2019d put on a suit. Forbes says wearing less formal clothing doesn\u2019t alter how he approaches game days, and it\u2019s a change he likes. \u201cI\u2019m not coaching any different,\u201d Forbes said. \u201cI\u2019m just more comfortable, and that\u2019s kind of important for me. You know, some of these guys who look like GQ models, probably doesn\u2019t affect them as much as it does me. I\u2019d rather have a little more arm room when I\u2019m coaching, so I\u2019ve actually really enjoyed it.\u201d Forbes isn\u2019t alone in supporting the change, but it\u2019s not a unanimous decision among ACC coaches to stray away from suits beyond this season. Virginia Tech head coach Mike Young doesn\u2019t miss the traditional suit, but he expects to go back to the look next season when leading the Hokies. \u201cI\u2019ll wear a coat and tie,\u201d Young said. \u201cI think that\u2019s how we\u2019re supposed to dress.\u201d N.C. State head coach Kevin Keatts didn\u2019t commit to wearing a suit next season, but the Wolfpack\u2019s leader possesses an array of impressive ensembles. From plaid outfits to blue jackets to a classic black suit, Keatts owns options. He\u2019s even known to rock a red suit from time to time, pulling off a look in line with N.C. State\u2019s school colors. It\u2019s daring, but Keatts makes it work. \u201cYou think about all those years that we\u2019ve invested in buying suits, and now we don\u2019t wear them \u2014 and I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s where we should go back to \u2014 but it is a different feeling,\u201d Keatts said. The stylish coach of the Wolfpack hinted about a possible return to a more elegant look this season. \u201cI miss my lucky suit,\u201d Keatts said. \u201cI\u2019ve got a suit that I\u2019ve never lost in before, so I may even put that on.\u201d As superstitious N.C. State fans wonder why Keatts doesn\u2019t choose his lucky \u2014 and undefeated \u2014 outfit every game, Notre Dame\u2019s supporters ponder just how far Mike Brey will push the limits of business casual. Notre Dame\u2019s head coach, who previously wore shorts and a Notre Dame t-shirt when the Irish won the Maui Invitational in 2017, once again caught the attention of basketball fashion fans when he wore shorts for a Jan. 2 game against North Carolina this season. The look likely made West Virginia head coach Bob Huggins proud. Huggins is arguably the college coach best known for dressing casually, as he usually sports a windbreaker on the sidelines and has for years. Huggins is the king of comfort in the college basketball world. \u201cI have a feeling moving forward that it may be hard to get a lot of coaches back in suits, and I\u2019m sure going to be one of them,\u201d Brey laughed. \u201cActually Bob Huggins is gonna run a seminar this summer on sideline attire, and I will be attending that.\u201d ACC coaches have plenty to worry about this season. From keeping their players and coaches safe from COVID-19 to trying to win at home without packed arenas to crafting game plans for challenging opponents, coaches are busy. When it comes to packing for a road trip, tossing team-issued polos into a suitcase makes for one less concern. The reigning national champions seem gleeful about that change. \u201cTrust me, it\u2019s been discussed multiple times with our staff,\u201d Bennett said. \u201cWe\u2019re not a GQ staff.\u201d","725":"Bronco Mendenhall often shares a desire for \u201cunbroken growth\u201d in his program. After going 5-5 in 2020, can the Wahoos get back to the top of the ACC Coastal Division in 2021? With the ACC returning to divisional play in 2021, the Cavaliers face familiar foes this fall. If they want to win the Coastal Division and make the conference title game, they\u2019ll need to win on the road. UNC and Miami are expected to be among the best in the division in 2021, and UVa faces both squads on the road. The ACC shared the dates of the league schedule on Thursday. UVa opens conference play with North Carolina before facing Miami two weeks later. It\u2019s not the first time the Cavaliers have started conference play with challenging matchups. Virginia faced eventual ACC champion Clemson in its second game of the 2020 season, and it faced N.C. State and Miami in the first half of its season. Unfortunately for the Wahoos, they lost all three of those challenging matchups in 2020. They\u2019ll hope to bounce back in 2021. Virginia also holds opportunities to take down solid nonconference foes. Those chances will be valued by the league, especially after the conference went 0-6 in bowl games in 2020. The Wahoos play Illinois for its first FBS game of the fall, and they\u2019ll also play at BYU on Oct. 30. The biggest nonconference game comes in November, when Virginia hosts Notre Dame. The Fighting Irish are back to being an independent in 2021 after spending 2020 as an ACC team. With the schedule now released, here are three takeaways from Virginia\u2019s schedule: Bronco vs. BYU Bronco Mendenhall maintained for years he didn\u2019t want to play BYU during his UVa coaching tenure. Even with the teams scheduled to play in 2019 when he took the UVa job in 2015, Mendenhall said as he left BYU that he had no intention of ever playing against the Cougars. \u201cWhenever it is, if it\u2019s up to me, I don\u2019t want that to happen because this is the place that shaped and had such an influence on my life that I don\u2019t see how that can happen, and I hope it doesn\u2019t,\u201d Mendenhall said in 2015. The game against BYU was moved back to the 2021 season five years ago, and while Mendenhall has made clear he doesn\u2019t want to play the game, the game remains on Virginia\u2019s schedule. By all accounts, the game will happen. \u201cI commit more than just like the professional part when I coach, and there\u2019s just something that is really challenging about then playing against a place where you\u2019ve kind of given more than just the professional part and so I didn\u2019t want to,\u201d Mendenhall said on his radio show this December. Mendenhall acknowledged that the outside interest in him matching up with BYU likely outweighs his desire to avoid the matchup. The teams are scheduled to meet this October in Provo, Utah. It\u2019s sure to be an emotional week for Mendenhall, who was tearful in 2015 when he said goodbye to BYU. \u201cI have feelings for the players and this program that they\u2019re not going away, and they\u2019re not going away in four years,\u201d Mendenhall said in 2015. On the field, BYU will need to adjust to losing star quarterback Zach Wilson, who is expected to be a first round pick in the 2021 NFL Draft. Early road tests If UVa wants to win the Coastal Division, it needs to win on the road, and it needs to win on the road in September. Virginia plays at North Carolina on Sept. 18 to open its ACC slate. On Sept. 30, UVa faces a challenging Miami team in South Florida. UNC and Miami are the two teams most likely to enter the season as division favorites. For UVa to compete for a division title, it likely needs to win one or both matchups against the Tar Heels and Hurricanes. With attendance at sporting events likely to increase over the coming months as COVID-19 vaccines are distributed, those environments could be hostile. Road games with Louisville on Oct. 9 and Pitt on Nov. 20 also present challenges. Since Mendenhall\u2019s arrival at UVa, the Cavaliers are 6-20 in true road games. Virginia went 0-4 on the road in 2020, falling to Clemson, Wake Forest, Miami and Virginia Tech. At home, UVa finished the 2020 season 5-1. While the Wahoos likely won\u2019t be the ACC Coastal favorite, they\u2019re good enough to be in the mix. The team needs to win on the road for their championship dreams to become a reality. Late bye week UVa and Syracuse are the only ACC teams without an open date until Week 10. Mendenhall\u2019s team won\u2019t play on Nov. 6, sitting out that Saturday after an Oct. 30 trip to BYU. The bye week gives UVa an extra week to prepare for a home showdown with Notre Dame. The bye week could come at an ideal time for the Cavaliers, as the Oct. 30 trip to BYU could be emotionally draining for the coaching staff. Many members of the staff coached at BYU with Mendenhall, and they haven\u2019t competed against the Cougars since leaving for UVa. A late bye week also presents challenges. Virginia hasn\u2019t gone this late into the season without a bye week until 2007. How will the Wahoos handle nine games without a break?","726":"The No. 14 Virginia women\u2019s tennis team opened the home portion of its schedule Thursday with a 7-0 victory over VCU at the Boar\u2019s Head Sports Club. The Cavaliers (2-1) won the doubles point with victories on courts one and three before sweeping the singles matches to earn the victory over the Rams (1-1). \u201cThe team was really excited to get out on our home courts and play in front of our family and friends today,\u201d Virginia coach Sara O\u2019Leary said. \u201cWe\u2019re proud of the way they responded after a tough road trip last weekend. We had some very close matches and had some chances, but I think in that match at Ohio State we learned so much about ourselves and grew from that match. I\u2019m excited to see how they responded today and moving forward to the rest of the season.\u201d With a 1-0 lead entering singles, Natasha Subhash and Rosie Johanson put the Cavaliers on the brink of clinching the match with straight-set victories at No. 2 and 3 singles, respectively. Vivian Glozman clinched the victory for the Wahoos with a win at the fifth spot in the lineup. Hibah Shaikh, Emma Navarro and Amber O\u2019Dell closed things out with wins on courts four, one and six, respectively. Virginia will host No. 18 South Carolina on Saturday in a 4 p.m. match at the Boar\u2019s Head Sports Club. Spaanstra on MAC Hermann watch list Alexa Spaanstra, a junior forward on the Virginia women\u2019s soccer team, has been named to the MAC Hermann Trophy Watch List, the Missouri Athletic Club and the United Soccer Coaches announced on Thursday. The MAC Hermann Trophy, the most prestigious individual award in college soccer, is presented annually to the most outstanding male and female players of the year. This year\u2019s award was pushed back to accommodate the seasons affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Winners will be announced May 27 at the 2021 MAC Hermann Trophy Press Conference and Banquet at the Missouri Athletic Club in St. Louis. A three-year starter for the Cavaliers, Spaanstra is a three-time All-ACC selection and has been named to the ACC Championships All-Tournament team all three seasons. She was a 2018 United Soccer Coaches All-Region selection as a freshman. Spaanstra has tallied 18 goals and 20 assists in her career, including five game-winning goals. In a shortened season this past fall, she tallied six goals and a pair of assists while playing in eight matches.","727":"The University of Virginia announced Friday that will it be reducing staffing levels in the athletics department due to budget shortfalls created in part by the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to the staff cuts, the UVa athletic program also will not fill several open positions. The school did not reveal how many staff positions would be cut or how many open positions would not be filled in its announcement. \u201cThese are incredibly painful decisions,\u201d Virginia athletics director Carla Williams said in a release announcing the cuts, \u201cbut they are, unfortunately, a necessary part of an overall strategy to address the financial challenges we face.\u201d Virginia has not revealed how much its current budget shortfall is, but the financial challenges to the athletic program that have been caused by the pandemic are evident. UVa has been unable to sell tickets to any sporting events during the 2020-21 athletic year, including revenue drivers football and men\u2019s basketball, costing the program potentially millions of dollars in revenue. Additionally, the athletic department has had to take on the additional costs of having its athletes receive COVID-19 testing three times per week during their athletic seasons, per ACC mandates, as well as for enhanced sanitation and safety measures for athletes and staff. The staff reductions are the latest move by the UVa athletic department to help offset its budget shortfall. In May, the school announced that more than 70 athletic department staff members, including all 20 head coaches, Williams and 51 assistant coaches, were taking voluntary pay reductions ranging from five to 10 percent that began in mid-April and ran until the end of 2020. Whether those staff members will continue to take pay cuts during 2021 to help with the continuing budget shortfall was not immediately clear. \u201cWe have a very dedicated staff and the evidence of that dedication and shared sacrifice has been at the forefront during this pandemic,\u201d Williams said. \u201cDespite these challenges, the priority remains delivering championship opportunities for our coaches and student-athletes.\u201d","728":"Virginia controlled Virginia Tech for the first 32 minutes on Saturday night. Tony Bennett\u2019s team held the lead for most of the game and seemed destined to beat the Hokies. Instead, UVa\u2019s offense went cold, the defense failed to generate stops and the refs blew their whistles. Virginia Tech trailed 47-44 entering the final eight minutes. The Hokies outscored UVa 21-4 the rest of the game to turn a slim deficit into a blowout 65-51 win. It\u2019s a surprising loss for UVa, which had been playing some of its best basketball of the season prior to Saturday\u2019s showing. Mike Young and the Hokies (13-3, 7-2 ACC) got the better of Bennett and the Wahoos (11-3, 7-1 ACC) on Saturday night. Here are three takeaways from Virginia\u2019s loss. Winning streaks snapped UVa fans felt heartbreak in 2018 when their team became the first No. 1 seed to lose to a No. 16 seed in the NCAA Tournament. Since then, it\u2019s been mostly high points for the Hoos. Virginia won the national title in 2018-19 and ended last season on an eight-game winning streak before COVID-19 canceled the NCAA Tournament. This season, the Wahoos appear to be hitting their stride. They ran into a roadblock Saturday night. The Cavaliers had won 15 consecutive ACC games dating back to last season. With the loss, the streak snaps and the Wahoos move to 7-1 in the ACC. UVa still leads the ACC, even with the defeat. In the Commonwealth Clash, UVa\u2019s winning streak of four games was broken with the loss. The Cavaliers had won four consecutive games against Virginia Tech in Blacksburg. Clark fades in second half UVa point guard Kihei Clark seems to play his best basketball against Virginia Tech. The junior buried the game-winning 3-pointer in Blacksburg last season after dominating in UVa\u2019s win in Charlottesville. Over two games last season, Clark averaged 14 points on 56.3% shooting from the floor and 60% shooting from 3-point range. Saturday, Clark shined against his in-state rival. Well, at least in the first half. Clark started the scoring for both sides when he buried a 3-pointer from the top of the key and gave a quick glance at the Virginia Tech sideline. He didn\u2019t let up in the first 20 minutes, finishing the first half with 11 points with a perfect 3-for-3 mark from beyond the arc. He was electric. Unfortunately for the Cavaliers, Clark\u2019s offensive output faded in the second half. He scored no points in the second half and finished the game shooting 4-of-13 from the field. He didn\u2019t record any assists. It wasn\u2019t an awful game from Clark by any means, but the Wahoos could\u2019ve used a basketball from the gutsy leader in the final few minutes. No answer to Aluma Keve Aluma, a Wofford transfer, sat out last season. The 6-foot-9 forward played Saturday, and he made his presence felt. The athletic big man used his quickness and 3-point shooting to put pressure on Jay Huff. Aluma forced Huff to guard him on the perimeter and was able to attack the rim when Huff came too close on the outside. When Huff left the game, UVa tried Francisco Caffaro, Trey Murphy, Sam Hauser and Justin McKoy on the big man. Unfortunately for the Wahoos, no player came up with the answers to stop Aluma. UVa missed center Kadin Shedrick, who has missed the past few games with a health issue. Aluma finished with 29 points and 10 rebounds. He went 10-for-15 from the floor and 2-for-3 from 3-point range. In his first Commonwealth Clash, Aluma stole the show and led his squad to a victory.","729":"Before tipping off the college basketball season, Pittsburgh\u2019s Jeff Capel chatted with school\u2019s football coach, Pat Narduzzi, about playing through the COVID-19 pandemic. Among the challenges Narduzzi cautioned Capel about was the challenge on developing consistency from week to week and game to game. \u201cHe said, \u2018You\u2019ll see it once you actually get started and you start playing games,\u201d said Capel. \u201cAnd he was 100% right on.\u201d The ACC made it successfully through the football season, though Narduzzi wasn\u2019t the only one to note the lack of carryover from one performance to the next. \u201cOne game doesn\u2019t seem to be leading into another,\u201d North Carolina\u2019s Mack Brown, a college football hall of famer who coached Texas to a national championship, noted back in the fall. Now, their basketball peers are experiencing a similar lack of consistency. Only one team in the ACC has been able to string together a winning streak of more than five straight victories. That was first-place Virginia, but the No. 8 Cavaliers\u2019 just had their run ended by rival Virginia Tech on Saturday night. Playing a schedule almost entirely of conference games, along with the challenges of teams either missing players, having games postponed or changed, or dealing with program shutdown because of COVID protocols have made getting into any kind of a rhythm nearly impossible. Clemson coach Brad Brownell noticed obvious slippage in his team\u2019s basic fundamentals after the program paused last month. But maybe more importantly, Brownell said coaches have to spend more time focused on the mental health and emotional well-being of players this year, time that previously had been spent on x\u2019s and o\u2019s. \u201cYou\u2019re probably doing more coaching of attitude and mentality and where\u2019s your team?\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re doing a lot of that. There\u2019s a lot of individual meetings with players because kids are struggling with things that are not just basketball.\u201d Capel and North Carolina State coach Kevin Keatts said fans might get a skewed view of how comfortably players are navigating the pandemic when they watch games. \u201cIt\u2019s tough being a kid or an athlete right now,\u201d said Keatts. \u201cPeople don\u2019t see that because when you flip on the TV, you just see the finished product. You see those guys who are out there playing. They look like they\u2019re having fun. TV can trick you.\u201d The result of all that added stress, disrupted schedules and general uncertainty has been inconsistent play for much of the league. \u201cI think it\u2019s affected everything, your preparedness for a game,\u201d said Capel. \u201cOne week you can look really good. The next week you can look like you have no idea what the hell you\u2019re doing, like you\u2019re not prepared, like you didn\u2019t practice.\u201d Virginia (11-3, 7-1 ACC) and Virginia Tech (13-3, 7-2), comparatively speaking, have been among the league\u2019s more consistent programs, a big part of the reason they sit in first and second in the conference standings. Tech coach Mike Young said his team hasn\u2019t missed a practice yet, and UVa\u2019s Tony Bennett noted his program handled its one full pause as well as could be expected, winning eight of nine, including seven straight before Saturday\u2019s loss to the Hokies. Eight of the league\u2019s 15 teams have yet to win more than three in a row, and last-place Boston College hasn\u2019t posted back-to-back wins this season. Last year, six teams won at least sixth straight and four \u2014 Virginia, Duke, Florida State and Louisville \u2014 had runs of eight wins or more. Moreover, ACC teams have followed some of their biggest wins or win streaks with head scratching losses. Capel\u2019s Pittsburgh team capped a three-game winning streak with a 79-73 win over Duke on Jan. 19, then proceeded to drop three in a row, two against Wake Forest and Notre Dame, two of the four teams in the league with losing overall records. Louisville looked impressive in a win over Duke on Jan. 23, then lost at struggling Clemson four days later. Florida State had won five in a row before losing 76-65 at Georgia Tech on Saturday. Perhaps no team has been harder to take the pulse of than Brownell\u2019s Clemson squad. The Tigers opened the year 9-1, playing a stifling defense that was the best in the ACC for the first two months. Then, a lengthy COVID pause disrupted their momentum. When Clemson returned, it wasn\u2019t competitive in a string of three blowout losses, falling by 35 to UVa, 18 at Georgia Tech and 19 at Florida State. The Tigers appeared to have gotten back on track with a 54-50 win over Louisville, but turned around and got hammered by Duke, 79-53, on Saturday. \u201cWe lost our edge a little bit,\u201d said Brownell. \u201cI was worried about that and probably didn\u2019t do a good enough job coaching it in the couple weeks coming out. \u2026 You kind of lose your fundamentals a little bit. If you\u2019re not coaching that every day, there\u2019s just drop off.\u201d","730":"As the University of Virginia begins its spring semester, the school\u2019s athletic department shared a COVID-19 update on Tuesday. From Dec. 14-Jan. 31, the athletic department administered 3,923 COVID-19 tests to student-athletes and staff members. Of those tests, 31 yielded positive test results. UVa began testing student-athletes and staff members on July 5. In the nearly six months since testing began, the athletics department has administered 18,330 tests. Of those tests, 138 tests came back positive. Student-athletes and staff members who test positive for the virus must self-isolate for a minimum of 10 days due to local health guidelines. Close contacts of people who test positive for the virus are asked to self-quarantine for 10 days. They\u2019re able to return after 10 days assuming they don\u2019t show symptoms over those 10 days. Additionally, close contacts can end a self-quarantine after seven days if they receive a negative COVID-19 test on or after the fifth day following exposure. Several UVa sports are expected to begin their spring seasons in the coming weeks, while a few winter sports. such as wrestling and swimming and diving are currently competing. Men\u2019s basketball remains in action after starting its season in November. The women\u2019s basketball team announced in January that it would cancel the rest of its season due to COVID-19 concerns. UVa\u2019s athletic department expects to share weekly COVID-19 updates now that the spring semester has started.","731":"Playing in windy and cool conditions in Orlando on Tuesday, the Virginia women\u2019s golf team erased an 11-shot deficit to win UCF Challenge, their first tournament of the 2021 season. UVa shot 1-under 287 on Tuesday at Eagle Creek Golf Club for a three-day total of 5-under 859 to take home the team title. The Cavaliers, who finished one stroke ahead of second-place Wake Forest, were the only team in the 17-school field to shoot under par during each of the final two rounds. \u201cI truly believe that the conditions that we qualified in back in Charlottesville helped us prepare for a day like this,\u201d Virginia coach Ria Scott said. \u201cWhen we got out here today, we said there is no team more prepared to play in this cold and wind than we are. I think they really believed that. There were times our players were playing clubs more than 30 yards what they would normally hit.\u201d Senior Beth Lillie and sophomore Celeste Valinho both shot 2-under 214 to tie for third place to lead Virginia. Lillie played her final 36 holes at 5-under par to post the 10th top-10 finish of her Cavalier career. \u201cBeth has become such a leader on this squad,\u201d Scott said. \u201cShe\u2019s played some incredible golf at home. She won our fall competition and she was low in all of our qualifying. We\u2019ve known that Beth Lillie has been playing great for the last seven months, but the rest of the golf world hasn\u2019t really known that because she hasn\u2019t been able to compete. \u201cShe\u2019s so calm and collected on the golf course now. Her confidence really spills over into her teammates. All of these gals that are in this lineup this week, there\u2019s a way about them that brings calm to their other teammates because they know they\u2019ve got each other\u2019s backs on the golf course.\u201d Junior Riley Smyth had the team\u2019s best final-round score, shooting 2-under 70. She completed play in seventh place at 1-under 215. Jennifer Cleary posted a 10th-place showing in her collegiate debut. The freshman shot 2-over 74 on Tuesday and finished her three rounds at even par 216. The UCF Challenge was the Cavaliers\u2019 first tournament of the season. The program did not compete during the fall as part of the ACC guidelines for the sport under its COVID-19 protocols. \u201cIt has been so long since we\u2019ve competed,\u201d said Scott who is in her third season at Virginia. \u201cWe haven\u2019t really had a measure for the work that we\u2019ve put in in the offseason. I think it really validates all of the offseason work these players have been doing, and just gives them a lot of confidence headed into the rest of the season because we beat some really high-quality teams here.\u201d","732":"Virginia hasn\u2019t played a lacrosse game in 11 months. That changes on Saturday when the Cavaliers host Towson. \u201cIt\u2019s been a lot of sitting around and wondering what we were going to do,\u201d senior attackman Matt Moore said. \u201cIt really makes you miss the sports and miss playing. That first practice we had, I\u2019ve never seen 50 guys more happy to play with each other.\u201d UVa, the last team to win an NCAA men\u2019s lacrosse championship now knows its path to \u2018defend\u2019 that title. No. 6 Virginia opens its season Saturday at home against the Tigers, plays ACC home-and-home series with North Carolina and Syracuse, and has intriguing nonconference matchups with Richmond and Navy this season, the school announced Wednesday. \u201cHow great is this? We have a game,\u201d said UVa coach Lars Tiffany. \u201cWe\u2019re about to embark on 2021 season that feels real, that feels like a normal season.\u201d The Cavaliers will face three of the top four teams in the Inside Lacrosse preseason Top 25. No. 1 Duke visits UVa on April 15. The third-ranked Orange host Virginia on Feb. 27 and make a return trip to Charlottesville on April 24. Fourth-ranked North Carolina visits Virginia on March 11, and the Cavaliers play in Chapel Hill, N.C. on April 10. Tiffany\u2019s team won the 2019 national championship and was 4-2 last year when the season was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic in early March. As has been the case with football and basketball schedules, COVID could impact the schedule. The ACC has left May 8 open for possible makeup games, and Virginia\u2019s May 1 game against Navy could be scrapped if the Patriot League needs to reschedule the Midshipmen for a conference game that day. \u201cThat\u2019s obviously a continuous thought of, just, \u2018Hey is this thing going to happen? What\u2019s this next game looking like?\u2019\u201d said senior defender Jared Conners. \u201cThe mentality we\u2019ve kind of taken on through the whole fall and into the spring is the conversation of, prepare for anything. We\u2019re not preparing to just beat a single opponent.\u201d There will be no ACC men\u2019s lacrosse tournament this season. The regular-season champion will be awarded the league\u2019s automatic bid to the NCAA Tournament. Currently, attendance for UVa\u2019s home games will be limited to friends and family of the teams, due to COVID-19 precautions. The Virginia women start their 15-match season on Feb. 13 at home against yet-to-be-determined opponent. The Cavaliers will play 10 ACC games and face four state schools in their other nonconference dates \u2014 Richmond, George Mason, VCU and James Madison. The women\u2019s ACC tournament is slated to be played April 28-May 2 at North Carolina. UVA was 5-3 when the 2020 season was canceled.","733":"The Virginia men\u2019s basketball team still has a basketball game to play Saturday afternoon at John Paul Jones Arena \u2014 just against a different opponent. With Louisville dealing with COVID-19 issues within its program, No. 14 UVa (11-3, 7-1 ACC) will host Pittsburgh instead of the Cardinals at 4 p.m. on Saturday, the conference announced on Wednesday. Virginia\u2019s home game against North Carolina State, which was postponed on Jan. 20, will be made up on Feb. 24. Those two teams played Wednesday night in Charlottesville. The Cavaliers still have to make up their Jan. 2 game against rival Virginia Tech, which was postponed following a positive COVID-19 test within the Virginia program. Virginia Tech beat Virginia on Saturday, snapping a seven-game win streak.","734":"In his always reserved, calm way, Tony Bennett called out his Virginia basketball team after its road loss to rival Virginia Tech on Saturday. And while the Cavaliers\u2019 coach did it with more subtlety and restraint than many of his peers might have, his message got across. Where Bennett labeled his teams play in Blacksburg \u201cfinesse-y\u201d and said the Hokies showed more want, his players heard a more direct challenge. \u201cYou never want your coach to call you soft, so you take that pretty personally,\u201d said senior forward Sam Hauser. \u201cWe responded pretty well tonight. We were physical. We were tough-minded.\u201d Another bad start to a second half left No. 14 Virginia on the brink of losing back-to-back games for the first time this basketball season. But unlike Saturday\u2019s loss at Tech, there was nothing soft about the Cavaliers\u2019 response down the stretch Wednesday. UVa (12-3, 8-1 ACC) used a 12-2 run late in the half to hold off North Carolina State, 64-57, remaining in first place in the conference. \u201cI kept saying that in a timeout\u00a0\u2014 \u2018Don\u2019t yield. Don\u2019t yield,\u2019\u201d said Bennett. \u201cAnd I was glad to see that we hung tough and came away with a good road victory.\u201d Hauser led the way, scoring 18 points and hitting a key 3-pointer with 5:38 to play to go up 50-46, part of the late surge that helped it win for the seventh straight time in Raleigh, N.C. Junior point guard Kihei Clark, who had no assists against Tech, the first time in his career he played at least 20 minutes without an assist, had a bounce back game in his own right. He scored eight points and had six assists, while committing three turnovers. His driving layup with 5:01 to play put Virginia up 52-48. Junior guard Trey Murphy III also scored 18 points and senior center Jay Huff had 12 points and 6 rebounds. \u201cI know for me, I just took it personal,\u201d said Murphy III. \u201cI was like, \u2018I\u2019m going to make sure that I can\u2019t give him a reason to call me soft.\u2019\u201d Unlike Saturday, Virginia\u2019s offense ramped up its efficiency and effectiveness late in the game to hold off the Wolfpack, who have now lost six of their last seven. The Cavaliers weren't just tougher in this one, they were sharper. UVA went 20 for 22 at the free throw line, including 16 for 18 in the second half. For State (7-7, 3-6), junior forward Jericole Kellems had his second straight big game, following up his 24-point performance against Syracuse on Sunday, led the Wolfpack with 23 on Wednesday night. The Cavaliers were pushed around in the second half of their road loss to rival Virginia Tech on Saturday, seeing their seven-game win streak snapped in the 65-51 defeat, their first ACC loss of the season, leading to Bennett\u2019s criticism. Early on, it didn\u2019t appear that UVa had addressed that, as the Wolfpack were able to penetrate the pack-line defense and score in the paint. Virginia also didn\u2019t improve its ball security, committing seven turnovers in the first half. Still, despite that, the Cavaliers led for much of the half and never trailed by more than 3 points in the period. Hauser scored 11 points in the first 9:35 of the game, as UVa hit seven of its first 10 shots to take a 19-13 lead. The Wolfpack used a 7-0 run to take a 20-19 lead with 6:05 left in the half as Virginia suffered a scoring drought of over six minutes, during which it committed four of its six first-half turnovers. Huff finally ended the long scoreless spell with a game-tying 3-pointer that knotted the game 22-22 with 3:53 to go before the break. North Carolina State went cold late in the half, hitting just two of its final eight shots as the Cavaliers built a 28-24 lead going to the locker room. In the second half, UVa pushed its lead to 43-34 after a pair of free throws by Clark with 12:27 to play. North Carolina State center D.J. Funderburk, who missed the team\u2019s game against Syracuse on Sunday, led a post-halftime surge for the Wolfpack. After being held scoreless in the first half, the 6-foot-10 senior scored six points in the first 9:27 after the break. His spurt helped State trim Virginia\u2019s lead to 43-41 midway through the period. Funderburk finished with nine points and five rebounds. The Wolfpack would take a 44-43 lead with 6:53 to play after a steal and dunk by Funderburk, but on this night, UVA found the fight to answer. Next up for Virginia, a curveball of a game Saturday when the Cavaliers will host Pittsburgh instead of Louisville, a change the ACC made Wednesday afternoon due to a positive COVID-19 test within the Cardinals\u2019 program. And the Wolfpack will get another shot at UVa on Feb. 24 in Charlottesville in another rescheduled affair. As for another Virginia postponement, Bennett said he has \u201cno idea\u201d what will happen with his team\u2019s second meeting with the Hokies. \u201cYou look for opportunities, but it has to make sense,\u201d said Bennett. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna try to make up the games, but if they make sense. I\u2019m not going to be pushed if they don\u2019t make sense. No way. No how.\u201d","735":"Juan Thornhill walked down to the first row of Hard Rock Stadium for a close view of his Kansas City Chiefs teammates taking the field for the Super Bowl last February. The NFL rookie, sidelined for the postseason with a torn ACL, was handling his emotions well \u2014 or so he thought. Once his teammates ran out of the locker room for the biggest game of the season, he shut down. \u201cI literally just went back to my seat and didn\u2019t talk the rest of the game,\u201d said Thornhill, a UVa standout from 2015-18. \u201cI was just really in my feelings, just really wishing I was out there with my teammates.\u201d On Sunday, a healthy Thornhill receives the chance to play in the NFL\u2019s biggest game. The Kansas City Chiefs, the reigning Super Bowl champions, play the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on Sunday night in Super Bowl LV. Thornhill, who worked his way back from the ACL injury over the offseason, is expected to play an important role in the defensive backfield for the Chiefs. A year after experiencing professional heartbreak, Thornhill will take the field in a Super Bowl in just his second NFL season. He\u2019s UVa\u2019s lone program representative in this year\u2019s Super Bowl. \u201cThis whole offseason in my mind, I was just thinking that we were going to get back to the Super Bowl,\u201d Thornhill said. \u201cThere was no other option.\u201d The journey to Sunday featured plenty of obstacles. Overcoming the emotional pain of missing the Super Bowl was one thing, but rehabbing from a torn ACL was another challenge. Rehabbing during a pandemic only added to the difficulty of returning. Thornhill spent time working out in the team facility, but he also performed workouts at home due to COVID-19 restrictions. He worked on healing his knee with the guidance of his team\u2019s training staff, but not always with them nearby. \u201cI just had to stay committed throughout the whole process because there are days you\u2019re not going to want to do it,\u201d Thornhill said. \u201cYou might have a lot of pain in your knee. You\u2019re not gonna want to do anything, but the thing is you have to be consistent.\u201d The former Virginia safety and overlooked high school recruit credits his commitment to daily rehab work for his quick return to action. He estimates it only took about seven months for him to return to the football field. Since retaking the field, Thornhill slowly returned to his previous form. He spent early portions of the regular season regaining confidence in his knee and playing through pain. As the season progressed \u2014 and the Chiefs monitored his snap count in the middle of the year \u2014 the pain faded and his mindset shifted to become more aggressive. He\u2019s played some of his best football in the postseason; recording a season-high four passes defended in the AFC Championship Game victory over the Buffalo Bills. \u201cHe was coming off a really, really, really big injury that really affects defensive backs and reacting and different things like that,\u201d Chiefs safety Tyrann Mathieu, who suffered two torn ACL injuries earlier in his career, said the week after beating the Bills. \u201cI think the more games he\u2019s played in, the more plays he\u2019s made his confidence is just continuing to grow. I thought last week was probably one of his best games just from him reading and reacting and bursting to the ball.\u201d In Charlottesville, Thornhill\u2019s former coach Nick Howell felt similarly to Mathieu. UVa\u2019s defensive coordinator and secondary coach saw a motivated and aggressive player when watching on TV in recent weeks. \u201cI watched that first playoff game, and you could tell he was grateful for the opportunity to be out there,\u201d Howell said. \u201cHe was taking advantage of the missed opportunities from a year ago. Played so hard, made a bunch of plays and was playing with passion, so it was fun to watch.\u201d The aggression comes as no surprise to Howell, who saw Thornhill develop into an All-ACC safety by the time he left UVa. He led the Cavaliers in tackles (98) and interceptions (6) as a senior. Perhaps most impressive was Thornhill\u2019s durability. He missed just one game over his final three seasons at UVa, not playing against Pitt in 2017 due to injury. The ACL injury led to the first missed games of Thornhill\u2019s professional career. He missed last year\u2019s postseason, but he\u2019s yet to miss an NFL regular season game through two seasons. Thornhill\u2019s Super Bowl appearance makes it 21 out of the last 22 Super Bowls that the Cavaliers have had at least one former player on the roster of a Super Bowl participant. UVa\u2019s coaches are glad to see the former All-ACC safety bouncing back after his injury. \u201cIt\u2019s just gratifying to watch guys be successful and have fun and do what they love,\u201d Howell said. \u201cYou\u2019re just pulling for him. He\u2019s part of our family, the UVa football family.\u201d A season ago UVa fans and coaches saw one of their favorite NFL players suffer a devastating injury to end a promising rookie season. This Sunday, they\u2019ll see Thornhill achieve a lifelong goal. \u201cThis is like your childhood dream to go out there and play in one of the biggest games ever,\u201d Thornhill said. \u201cI\u2019m really excited.\u201d","736":"The Virginia baseball team\u2019s journey to Omaha starts two weeks from Friday. The Wahoos announced their 2021 schedule Thursday afternoon, revealing that they\u2019ll open their season against Connecticut on Feb. 19. Virginia hosts UConn at Disharoon Park for a three-game series to start its season, marking the first time that the Cavaliers have opened their season at home since 2009. The 50-game season this spring features predominantly conference games, with UVa playing 36 ACC contests. Of the team\u2019s 50 games, 29 will occur at Disharoon Park. ACC play starts after just four nonconference games, which gives the Cavaliers little time to prepare for a challenging ACC schedule. UVa is slated to face every ACC team except N.C. State during the regular season. After the series with UConn and a Tuesday game with VMI, UVa travels to Chapel Hill for a three-game road series with North Carolina to close the month of February. A midweek game with George Washington is followed by another ACC road series, this time at Florida State. Richmond visits Charlottesville on March 10 to kick off an eight-game homestand. The other seven home games come from a three-game series with Notre Dame, a midweek game with Towson and a three-game series with Pittsburgh. After a short trip to Liberty on March 23, UVa hosts Miami the following weekend. Virginia plays George Washington for a second time on March 30, this time traveling to Washington, D.C to face the Colonials. The month of April begins with a road trip to Georgia Tech. UVa follows the series with the Yellow Jackets with a home game against William & Mary and a road series against Clemson. In-state opponents Old Dominion, VCU and Liberty all make appearances on UVa\u2019s midweek schedule in April. Louisville, Duke and Virginia Tech join Georgia Tech as UVa\u2019s ACC opponents for the month. The three-game road series with the Hokies begins at the end of April and bleeds into May. UVa hosts VCU on May 4 after facing the Hokies. Games against Wake Forest and Boston College wrap up Virginia\u2019s regular-season schedule. The ACC Tournament is slated to begin on May 25. As with all collegiate sports currently in action, the schedule requires flexibility. It\u2019s likely that some scheduling adjustments will be needed as teams try to navigate spring schedules amid the COVID-19 pandemic. When UVa is able to safely compete, it\u2019s expected to be among the best teams in the country. Baseball America lists Virginia as the No. 5 team in the nation to open the season.","737":"As he talked to friends on other college lacrosse teams across the ACC and the nation this offseason, Matt Moore noticed an abundance of confidence about the upcoming year. They\u2019d brag to him about all the returning fifth-year seniors taking advantage of the free year of eligibility or the transfers from the NCAA\u2019s portal their teams had added. At Virginia, the program took up a decidedly different approach that has become its mantra. \u201cAll we got is all we need,\u201d said Moore, senior attackman for the sixth-ranked Cavaliers. The slogan is one coach Lars Tiffany said he first heard used by Dox Aitken, a senior midfielder who left UVa to play football at Villanova before COVID-19 delayed the Wildcats\u2019 season until the spring. Now, he\u2019s returned and he brought with him the mantra that Tiffany said Aitken \u2014 a Pennsylvania native \u2014 borrowed from the Philadelphia Eagles. \u201cYou see all the transfers in the ACC, you use all these fifth-years coming back, it\u2019s easy to look at them and be scared and be like, \u2018Oh wow, they\u2019ve got 10 fifth-years coming back,\u2019\u201d said Moore. \u201cNot really worrying about that and kind of just focusing on ourselves.\u201d UVa may not have the influx of transfers or glut of fifth-year seniors opting to return that some programs enjoy, but the Cavaliers are anything but talent poor heading into Saturday\u2019s season opener against Towson. Aitken and defender Jared Conners did choose to come back for an extra season and Merrimack attackman Charlie Bertrand \u2014 a three-time Division II All-American \u2014 transferred in. \u201cWe still have the firepower over here,\u201d said Conners. \u201cWe have just as much talent as everybody else. A lot can be thrown onto, \u2018Oh we didn\u2019t have these guys come back or these guys were key players.\u2019 Just like any other year, the torch gets passed on to the next guy.\u201d Tiffany and the Cavaliers didn\u2019t push hard too add much because they don\u2019t think they need much. Michael Kraus is gone but senior Ian Laviano and redshirt freshman Connor Shellenberger, the nation\u2019s top recruit during his senior year at St. Anne\u2019s-Belfield, join Moore and Bertrand on what figures to be one of the ACC\u2019s most explosive attack units. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of offense,\u201d said Tiffany, whose team averaged 13.7 goals per game last season, which ranked fourth in the ACC and 20th in the nation. \u201cMaybe not enough balls.\u201d Tiffany and his players believe they have all they need to compete talent-wise. And, after months of pandemic-safe training that featured plenty of running, the Cavaliers are in top-notch cardiovascular shape. The question going into Saturday\u2019s 4 p.m. home match against the Tigers is, how sharp and how game-ready is UVa? If the answer is based on the team\u2019s performance in its recent scrimmage against Lynchburg College, the answer isn\u2019t a positive one. In fact, Tiffany compared his team\u2019s play in that exhibition to the BYU-Navy football game in September. In one of the first college football games of the 2020 season, the Cougars won 55-3 and Navy looked like a team that wasn\u2019t game-ready. Tiffany said he understands that feeling after watching his team scrimmage. \u201cWow, we forgot the blocking and tackling of the sport of lacrosse,\u201d he said. \u201cWe weren\u2019t aggressive on defense. The one-on-one matchups, there wasn\u2019t this mean, nasty, aggressiveness.\u201d Tiffany is hopeful that edge will return with the return of competition. He\u2019ll find out if he\u2019s right Saturday.","738":"Pittsburgh\u2019s season felt like it could be slipping away. The Panthers had lost three straight games, two of them coming against teams near the bottom of the ACC basketball standings. That\u2019s when coach Jeff Capel decided to find out just how much fight his team had. \u201cCoach made us go at each other in practice,\u201d star forward Justin Champagnie said on Friday. \u201cRoll the ball out. Let\u2019s go. Let\u2019s fight. Let\u2019s see who\u2019s tougher. \u2026 We did that for two days, and it worked.\u201d Pitt (9-5, 5-4 ACC), which visits No. 14 Virginia (12-3, 8-1) on Saturday, snapped its slide with an impressive home win over No. 20 Virginia Tech. \u201cPractice was being hard. We had 6 a.m. practice,\u201d forward Abdoul Karim Coulibaly said. \u201cIn the practice, if you missed a rebound anything, or missed anything, if you talk back to Coach, he\u2019s going to kick you out. It was tough.\u201d Coulibaly and Champagnie said Capel hasn\u2019t let up any since the win. Virginia had been scheduled to host Louisville, but a positive COVID-19 test within the Cardinals program forced them to postpone both of their games this week, Wednesday against Syracuse and Saturday at UVa. Instead, the ACC swapped in Pittsburgh as the Cavaliers\u2019 opponent. Virginia was scheduled to play the Panthers on Feb. 24. Instead, they\u2019ll face North Carolina State that night. The change caused some disruption for the assistant coaches who scout and game plan for upcoming opponents, Virginia coach Tony Bennett said, but should not have any impact on the players. They would have begun Louisville preparation on Thursday. Instead, they\u2019ll just start working on Pittsburgh. \u201cYou get ready,\u201d said Bennett. \u201cIt\u2019s not like we were preparing for Louisville before this. We were playing Virginia Tech on Saturday, we had Sunday off, so we had two practices to for North Carolina State. We do the pre-work and the scouting stuff, so our coaches, it\u2019s more work for the coaches. From the players\u2019 standpoint, probably not as much, in that regard.\u201d Those players sounded largely unfazed after Wednesday\u2019s road win over North Carolina State. \u201cI don\u2019t think it affects us much,\u201d senior forward Sam Hauser said. \u201cWe usually get two days of scout beforehand. Obviously they just came off a big win [over Virginia Tech], so got our hands full again.\u201d The change helps keep the topic of Virginia\u2019s toughness at the forefront. After getting pushed around in a road loss to the rival Hokies, and criticized for it by their coach, the Cavaliers responded with a more physical, aggressive effort Wednesday against the Wolfpack. It will need that style of play again against Pittsburgh. \u201cIt sounds like Pitt played very well to beat, obviously, a very quality Virginia Tech team,\u201d said Bennett. \u201cThey\u2019re physical and Coach Capel has really improved them.\u201d Defending Champagnie, the ACC\u2019s leading scorer, figures to be a focal point for the Cavaliers, as it was for the Hokies on Wednesday night. The 6-foot-6, 200-pound wing player came in averaging 20.1 points per game, but Tech held him to just 10. Friday, Champagnie credited the play of Hokies forward Justyn Mutts, who covered him tightly in man-to-man for most of the game. It\u2019s approach \u2014 along with double-teams in the post \u2014 Champagnie expects to see Saturday against UVa\u2019s Pack Line defense. \u201cHe didn\u2019t leave my side,\u201d Chamapgnie said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t leave my side the whole game. I rewatched the game. He didn\u2019t help. He didn\u2019t do nothing but just stay right next to me. I anticipate that going forward. I have to be better and find other ways to score and impact the game.\u201d","739":"A roster filled with exceptional offensive talent makes Virginia an explosive team. The Cavaliers showcased that explosiveness Saturday, turning a close game early in the second half into a comfortable 73-66 win over Pittsburgh. No. 14 Virginia (13-3, 9-1 ACC) beat Pitt (9-6, 5-5 ACC) thanks to a 3-point shooting barrage in the second half. The Cavaliers caught fire after a sluggish shooting start, and they maintained their lead in the ACC standings as a result. Here are three takeaways from UVa\u2019s win over Pitt. Hauser and Huff make their case Saturday featured a battle between three of the top candidates for ACC Player of the Year. Pitt\u2019s Justin Champagnie entered the weekend as the ACC\u2019s leading scorer. Champagnie showed why he\u2019s such a dynamic force for stretches Saturday, scoring with efficiency in the mid-range and low post. At other times, he tried tough finishes over UVa defenders and failed. It wasn\u2019t Champagnie\u2019s best performance, but he had strong moments and finished the game with 18 points and 10 rebounds on 8-of-18 shooting. Even with a decent game from Champagnie, UVa\u2019s ACC Player of the Year candidates stole the show Saturday. Sam Hauser and Jay Huff are both in the Player of the Year conversations, and they delivered with efficient offensive showings against Pitt. With the game tied at 36, UVa went on a 16-0 run fueled by 14 points from Hauser and Huff. Both players drained a pair of 3-pointers during the run, which broke the game open and put UVa in front for good. Hauser finished the game with 23 points on an incredibly efficient 8-of-9 shooting. He also chipped in with six rebounds. Huff scored 13 points on 5-of-6 shooting to go with eight rebounds and two blocks. Plenty of action remains as the three players aim to separate themselves in the ACC Player of the Year race. Woldetensae sparks bench UVa\u2019s bench failed to contribute a single point in the team\u2019s win against N.C. State. All 64 of the team\u2019s points came from the starting lineup, a rarity in the Tony Bennett era. Saturday, the bench provided a meaningful spark against Pitt. All bench scoring came from the left-handed Tomas Woldetensae, who can score with ease from 3-point range when he\u2019s feeling confident. Woldetensae scored 14 points Saturday on 4-of-6 shooting and 4-of-5 shooting from 3-point range. He made his first four shots of the game. His shooting off the bench gave the Cavaliers another weapon outside of the starting five. With Kihei Clark and Reece Beekman not always trusting their 3-point shooting, it helps Virginia to have a player like Woldetensae capable of shooting and scoring at the guard position. Cavaliers control ACC race UVa\u2019s victory over Pitt keeps the Cavaliers in the driver\u2019s seat in the ACC regular season title race. Entering Saturday, every ACC team outside Florida State had at least three conference losses. The Seminoles, currently on a COVID-19 pause, are 6-2 in conference play. After Saturday\u2019s win, UVa sits at 9-1 in ACC action. ACC teams were originally slated to play 20 conference games this season. Assuming every scheduled conference game is eventually completed, Virginia is at the halfway point of its conference schedule. There\u2019s a realistic chance UVa doesn\u2019t complete the full 20-game schedule by the time the conference tournament rolls around, which means the Wahoos may even be past the halfway point of conference action. Through 10 ACC games, UVa holds a commanding lead over its peers. While Virginia\u2019s conference schedule hasn\u2019t yet included teams like Florida State, North Carolina and Louisville, the Cavaliers keep beating teams put in front of them. Plenty of action remains \u2014 and Virginia Tech proved the Wahoos aren\u2019t invincible \u2014 but UVa sits in an ideal position in the conference standings after beating the Panthers. The team\u2019s next four games \u2014 at Georgia Tech, home against UNC, at Florida State and at Duke \u2014 will go a long way toward determining the ACC regular-season champion.","740":"After losing to Virginia Tech, the Virginia men\u2019s basketball team bounced back from a disappointing showing with a pair of wins last week. Victories over N.C. State and Pitt made for a good Monday this week for UVa sports fans. They saw their men\u2019s basketball program return to the top 10 in the AP poll, and the team\u2019s leading scorer earned an honor from the conference. UVa\u2019s other reigning national champion, men\u2019s lacrosse, added a game to its schedule for this weekend. Hauser named ACC Player of the Week For the first time this season, a UVa men\u2019s basketball player has been named ACC Player of the Week. Sam Hauser earned the honor for his play last week. Across two games, Hauser averaged 20.5 points and 5.5 rebounds per game. Perhaps most impressive was Hauser\u2019s shooting touch. He shot 65% from the floor, knocking down 50% of his 3-point attempts and draining all 10 of his shots from the free-throw line. Hauser leads UVa in scoring (15.4 points per game) and rebounding (seven rebounds per game). His 23 points against Pitt on Saturday were a season-best. Hauser was extremely efficient in the victory over the Panthers, making eight of his nine shots from the field. \u201cHe was the difference-maker for us,\u201d head coach Tony Bennett said after the win. Back into the top 10 The Virginia men\u2019s basketball team returned into the AP top 10 Monday, earning the No. 9 spot in the latest rankings. The Wahoos beat N.C. State and Pitt last week to complete an undefeated week. Elsewhere in the college basketball world, ranked teams lost in bunches over the past seven days. Fifteen of the 25 ranked teams lost at least once last week. Six of the teams in the top 10 lost at least once, and two of those teams lost twice. The frequent upsets and surprising defeats opened the door for UVa to climb from No. 14 to No. 9. Virginia is the highest-ranked ACC team. Florida State and Virginia Tech are the only other ACC teams in the poll, with the Seminoles ranking 17th and the Hokies one spot behind at No. 18. UVa plays at Georgia Tech on Wednesday before hosting North Carolina on Saturday. Both teams are unranked. Men\u2019s lacrosse adds opponent After dominating Towson 20-11 on Saturday to open its season, the UVa men\u2019s lacrosse team wanted to get on the field again. The Cavaliers added a game to their schedule for Saturday, as Army will visit Charlottesville for a noon game. The program announced that broadcast plans for the matchup would be announced soon. Army played a scrimmage on Saturday against Bryant, but Saturday\u2019s game against UVa will be the team\u2019s official season opener. Army went 6-2 last season before the season was cut short due to COVID-19. The Virginia women\u2019s lacrosse program also announced a scheduling change on Monday. The Cavaliers\u2019 matchup with East Carolina, which was scheduled to be played on Saturday, will now be played on Monday (Feb. 15) at 4 p.m. at Kl\u00f6ckner Stadium. The game will be broadcast on ACC Network Extra.","741":"The Virginia men\u2019s basketball team walked out of McCamish Pavilion on Jan. 18, 2020, a winner. In the year since, no other ACC team has defeated Georgia Tech on its home floor. On Wednesday night, No. 9 UVa (13-3, 9-1 ACC) returns to Atlanta with plans to defeat Georgia Tech (9-6, 5-4 ACC) and squash the Yellow Jackets\u2019 11-game ACC home winning streak. Josh Pastner\u2019s team, which nearly beat UVa in Charlottesville on Jan. 23, is a perfect 5-0 against ACC teams at home this season with wins over North Carolina, Clemson and Florida State. \u201cMan, are they confident in their building, but I think a lot of it too is they have created a home atmosphere,\u201d Notre Dame head coach Mike Brey said Monday. \u201cNo other place have we played where it\u2019s loud and there\u2019s a band, and it really helps their team.\u201d Even with attendance limitations due to COVID-19, the Yellow Jackets are benefiting from a home-court advantage. The program allows 1,200 fans per game, with students being given 75% of the ticket allotment. Georgia Tech\u2019s band also appears at home contests. ACC teams have thrived in their own buildings during this unusual season, with home teams winning 69.3% of ACC games. Boston College, which is 2-4 at home, is the only ACC team below .500 in home games this season. UVa allows only 250 fans at its home games, and while the cheerleaders were in attendance last weekend, the vibe at John Paul Jones Arena this season is largely subdued. Despite few fans, Virginia is a perfect 8-0 at home this year. The Yellow Jackets beat Notre Dame 82-80 at home on Saturday, keeping their home unbeaten streak alive. Brey even joked that after visiting Georgia Tech, he needs to talk to his athletic director about allowing a band into Notre Dame home games in March. N.C. State head coach Kevin Keatts laughed Monday, saying he calls games with 1,000 fans or more this season \u201csellouts.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve played in front of a few sellouts, and it does make a difference,\u201d Keatts said. For UVa, the Georgia Tech atmosphere most closely mirrors Clemson\u2019s home environment. The Tigers welcomed 1,876 people and their band into Littlejohn Coliseum when the two teams met in January. Virginia handled that setting well, beating Clemson 85-50 in arguably the team\u2019s best showing of the season. \u201cThere was life in the arena,\u201d Virginia coach Tony Bennett remarked after the win over Clemson. Without an overly vocal or fiery on-court presence this season, UVa seemed to embrace the added energy in the building when facing Clemson. Virginia\u2019s head coach expects a similar vibe in the arena Wednesday night against Georgia Tech. \u201cYou\u2019re fighting for atmosphere, energy, life, so yeah, it\u2019s just the way the ball bounces,\u201d Bennett said on his radio show. \u201cSome states or counties allow fans or allow more people in than others, so I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll be a live atmosphere.\u201d Georgia Tech\u2019s energetic crowd may help the team at home this season, but the Yellow Jackets enter the matchup with the Wahoos on an 11-game home ACC winning streak in large part due to their roster. Jose Alvarado leads the ACC in steals, and the guard is playing at an All-ACC level. Alvarado scored 20 points on 7-of-12 shooting to go with eight assists and six steals when the teams first met this season in January. UVa won that matchup 64-62. Michael Devoe and Bubba Parham add value at the guard spot alongside Alvarado, and Jordan Usher scored 19 points on the wing for Georgia Tech in the first meeting with Virginia. In the post, Moses Wright is undersized for a center, but he held his own in the first meeting with UVa. He scored 13 points and blocked five shots in the Georgia Tech\u2019s narrow defeat. The Yellow Jackets nearly handed UVa its first home loss of the season, leading by as many as 11 points in the second half before losing the lead down the stretch as Sam Hauser and Jay Huff made jump shots. \u201cI don\u2019t know if we faded,\u201d Pastner said Monday. \u201cI think Virginia hit some really tough shots. I think they\u2019re really good. That\u2019s what makes them so good. We\u2019ll have to play our best game of the year if we\u2019re gonna want to beat Virginia.\u201d Georgia Tech needs a good showing to defeat Virginia. Fortunately for the Yellow Jackets, they\u2019ll play the reigning national champions in front of a \u201csellout\u201d crowd Wednesday night.","742":"This spring, UVa is embarking on one of the busiest stretches in the history of the athletic program. While the pandemic remains a consistent threat to cancel games, many of Virginia\u2019s teams plan on competing in the coming months. UVa offered an update Tuesday on its COVID-19 situation, while also sharing another schedule of a fall Olympic sport team hoping to compete this spring. COVID-19 testing update UVa athletics shared its latest COVID-19 testing update Tuesday. The athletic department administered 1,110 COVID-19 tests to student-athletes and staff members from Feb. 1-7. Of those tests, eight returned positive results. Student-athletes and staff members who test positive are required to self-isolate for a minimum of 10 days. Those who are deemed close contact to people who test positive will self-quarantine for at least a week. Since UVa began testing student-athletes and staff members on July 5, a total of 19,440 COVID-19 tests have been administered. Of those tests, 146 returned positive results. Field hockey shares spring schedule After playing in the fall, the Virginia field hockey team is among the group of Olympic sport programs competing again in the spring. There\u2019s an NCAA Tournament this spring, and UVa will play a seven-game slate before any postseason action. UVa\u2019s schedule features a nonconference game with James Madison as well as games against six ACC foes. The Cavaliers begin their spring schedule on March 5 with a game against Duke. Virginia faces Louisville on March 13, JMU on March 21 and Wake Forest on March 27 to wrap up the month. UVa plays three times in April, starting with Boston College on April 2. A week later, UVa hosts North Carolina. The Tar Heels won the ACC championship this fall. UVa\u2019s spring season concludes against Syracuse on April 15. The ACC\u2019s automatic qualifier into the NCAA Tournament will be determined in a one-game playoff on April 23. The team with the best conference record in the spring will face UNC in Chapel Hill for the conference\u2019s automatic berth. It\u2019s a tough road into the NCAA Tournament for teams that don\u2019t win conference titles. The NCAA Tournament will include just 12 teams\u00a0\u2014 instead of the usual 16\u00a0\u2014 with 10 teams making the tournament via automatic qualification awarded for winning a conference. Only two at-large berths are offered this spring. Women\u2019s golf signee to play in Augusta Amanda Sambach, a UVa women\u2019s golf signee who will join the program in the fall, will play in the 2021 Augusta National Women\u2019s Amateur. The news was announced Tuesday. This will be the second iteration of the event, which began in 2019. Former UVa golfer Anna Redding competed in the inaugural event, advancing to the third and final round of the tournament. The final round is held at Augusta National Golf Club, the site of The Masters. Redding became the first woman to tee off at Augusta National in a championship event. The 2020 event was canceled due to the pandemic, but Sambach will tee it up this spring. Sambach, one of the best amateur players in the country, was invited to the event in January of 2020 and has only improved her game in the subsequent year. She\u2019s reached No. 3 in the American Junior Golf Association national rankings, and she\u2019s currently ranked 30th. The event begins on March 31 at the Champions Retreat Golf Club in Augusta, Georgia. After two rounds, the field is cut to 30 players. The entire field enjoys the opportunity to play a practice round at Augusta National on April 2, before the final round takes place at Augusta National. Women\u2019s lacrosse picked fourth in ACC The Virginia women\u2019s lacrosse team was picked to finish fourth in the ACC this spring by league coaches. UNC, Notre Dame and Syracuse were picked ahead of the Wahoos. The Cavaliers went 5-3 in 2020 before the season ended prematurely due to COVID-19. They begin their spring campaign Monday when they host East Carolina. Virginia is led by a veteran group, which includes eight returning starters. Among those starters is Ashlyn McGovern, who was a preseason All-ACC at-large selection. She\u2019s UVa\u2019s top returning attacker from a season ago after scoring 15 goals across eight games.","743":"The Virginia softball team released its 50-game spring schedule Wednesday and the Cavaliers will waste no time in taking the field. UVa\u2019s season begins Saturday when it travels to Georgia for the Red and Black Showcase. The Cavaliers play Georgia and South Alabama on Saturday before facing both teams again on Sunday. ACC pod play takes place after that, with the Wahoos playing Louisville and Pittsburgh three times in North Carolina from Feb. 18-21. The team will play doubleheaders on Feb. 20 and Feb. 21. Following pod action, UVa plays its home opener on Feb. 27 against James Madison as part of the Cavalier Classic. The Cavaliers also play George Washington from Feb. 27-29 to conclude the event, which is held at Palmer Park. Due to COVID-19 concerns and a desire to reduce travel, ACC teams will play four-game conference series following pod play. Teams will compete once on Fridays followed by Saturday doubleheaders and one Sunday game. Clemson is UVa\u2019s first ACC opponent outside of pod play. The Cavaliers host the Tigers from March 5-7. A midweek game against Virginia Tech follows, and the Wahoos hit the road for a four-game set with Duke from March 12-14. A four-game series with N.C. State from March 19-21 is followed by midweek road games with Liberty and Virginia Tech on March 23 and 24. UVa returns to Palmer Park for a four-game series with Boston College from April 1-3. After a midweek game with Liberty on April 6, UVa plays just conference games the rest of the season. A series with UNC from April 9-11 is followed by games at Notre Dame from April 16-18, a home series with Syracuse from April 23-25 and a road set with Georgia Tech from April 30\u2013May 2. The game with the Yellow Jackets on May 2 is the regular-season finale. Virginia went 10-12 last year and finished with a winless record in ACC play, dropping all six of its conference contests. The team\u2019s 2020 spring season was cut short due to COVID-19. Head coach Joanna Hardin returns almost everyone from last season, giving the program hope that it can turn the corner in the ACC this spring.","744":"Braxton Key slammed home a two-handed dunk in overtime of the Virginia men\u2019s basketball team\u2019s national championship win over Texas Tech in 2019. The transition dunk sealed the program\u2019s first national title victory and became an iconic moment in UVa basketball history. Key considered that moment arguably the highlight of his life. At least until his daughter Lennox was born in October. \u201cThe greatest joy of my life so far,\u201d Key said of becoming a father. \u201cIt\u2019s been everything. I thought winning the national championship was great, but this tops it by a lot. She\u2019s everything to me, and she brightens up my day every time I see her.\u201d Having a daughter brings Key joy, and it also provides a sense of motivation and responsibility. Key, who played his final two collegiate seasons at Virginia after transferring from Alabama, begins his professional basketball career Thursday as a member of the Delaware Blue Coats, the G League affiliate of the NBA\u2019s Philadelphia 76ers. A total of 18 G League teams will play a modified 15-game season in a \u201cbubble\u201d in Orlando, hoping to keep players and staff safe from COVID-19 exposure while also providing some semblance of a season. Playing in the bubble means time away from Lennox and his girlfriend, Taylor, but Key knows the sacrifice gives him a path to play in the NBA after going undrafted in the 2020 NBA Draft. \u201cIt\u2019s hard just Facetiming and just missing out on some milestones,\u201d Key said. \u201cShe just starting learning how to grab her feet and grab things, so I\u2019m sad I\u2019m missing all that, but at least I can FaceTime. Hopefully I can get out of here as soon as possible and see her soon.\u201d Key\u2019s desire to succeed as a professional basketball player ramped up following the birth of his daughter. The small forward spent months in Richmond this offseason working with his trainer Matt Irving following the premature end to UVa\u2019s 2019-20 season. After two weeks off following the conclusion of Virginia\u2019s season, Key hit the gym five days a week with Irving. Irving was impressed with Key\u2019s commitment to their workouts before Lennox\u2019s birth, but said Key has been a different man since early October. \u201cAfter she was born, it was just a whole new focus for him as far as basketball,\u201d Irving said. \u201cHe knows he\u2019s got to do it for her now and he\u2019s gotta do it for his girlfriend, so just a totally different focus and he was really, really locked in.\u201d Irving said Key set a goal of shooting 60% with Irving on all shooting drills when they started working together this offseason. In the weeks following the birth of his daughter, Key was hitting 75% of his shots. Before a G League opportunity came in January, Irving and Key dissected the athletic wing\u2019s jumper, trying to find tweaks to help the elite defender and rebounder become a more consistent offensive threat. Key only shot 18.5% from 3-point range his senior year at UVa, a dip from the 30.5% mark he reached as a junior. Across his four year career Key shot just 27.4% from 3-point range, but he blossomed as a rebounder and defender in his two seasons at UVa, especially during his senior season in 2019-20. He and Mamadi Diakite helped anchor a team that relied heavily on defense to win games. Key secured 7.4 rebounds per game last season for UVa, while also adding 1.2 steals per contest. Both marks were career-bests. With defense a strength, Key wanted to improve his jump shot this offseason, while also becoming a more effective finisher near the rim. Irving and Key went to work on those areas. \u201cI didn\u2019t really know when an opportunity would be available, but I just wanted to stay as ready as possible,\u201d Key said. Working with Irving, who has trained NBA players such as Bradley Beal and Jayson Tatum, meant reducing lower body movement on his jump shot. The esteemed trainer wanted Key to simplify his shooting stroke. Both believe the shooting work has paid off. While Key\u2019s game Thursday, the season opener for the Blue Coats, is his first competitive game since the end of UVa\u2019s season in 2020, he feels more comfortable with his shooting stroke. Irving said Key became more consistent during the pre-draft process, even making jumpers from near half court. Irving stresses to Key the importance of staying patient once the G League season starts. He doesn\u2019t want Key to press, but rather play his game throughout the month-long season. Key plans on absorbing knowledge from other players on his team, including Justin Robinson. The former Virginia Tech standout played in the G League last season, while also earning playing time in nine NBA games for the Washington Wizards. \u201cI think we have a really talented team,\u201d Key said. \u201cA lot of guys have NBA experience. I\u2019m just kind of learning from them, picking their brains, not only for this season but also looking down the road. My ultimate goal is the NBA.\u201d With Key\u2019s sights set on an NBA career, he\u2019ll need to attract attention from NBA squads with quality play at the G League level. He\u2019ll have plenty of support from afar during his month in Orlando, with his trainer and family watching Key\u2019s professional basketball debut. Irving has high hopes for his client, who he believes can make his way into the NBA guy as someone who adds shooting and defense, before eventually developing into a potential starter. \u201cI think he can play in the NBA for a long time,\u201d Irving said.","745":"Unhappy with the toughness his team showed in its lone preseason scrimmage last month, Virginia men\u2019s lacrosse coach Lars Tiffany ratcheted up the physicality of his team\u2019s drills in practice leading into last weekend\u2019s season opener. Tiffany, who admittedly had sought to limit contact in the preseason to help prevent the possible spread of COVID-19, brought out the \u201cPrison GBs,\u201d a drill where five players essentially compete in a scrum for a ground ball, while the rest of the team stands around in arc to watch and cheer. \u201cJust kind of a heart drill,\u201d said senior defender Kyle Kology. \u201cYou\u2019re just trying to pick up a ball in a very small area and trying to score while other guys are trying to hack at you and get the ball out of the zone as much as they can.\u201d Tiffany said the team\u2019s edge and toughness was better in its season-opening 20-11 win over Towson. The No. 3 Cavaliers (1-0), who have led the nation in ground balls each of the past four seasons, dominated that statistic 56-35 against the Tigers. \u201cI was very happy with what I saw in terms of the hunger,\u201d said Tiffany of his team\u2019s improvement since its scrimmage. \u201cWe were not intense. We were not ready to get mean and nasty with Lynchburg. We let them dodge where they wanted to dodge and pick up the ground balls.\u201d On Sunday, UVa may need to be even tougher when it hosts traditionally-physical Army, in a game added to the schedule this week. It will be the No. 12 Black Knights\u2019 season opener. The game was originally scheduled for Saturday at Kl\u00f6ckner Stadium, but due to the inclement weather forecast, the game was moved to Sunday at noon and will now be played on UVa\u2019s Lower Turf practice field. Tiffany had been searching for a game on that date, monitoring a website coaches are using to see who might have schedule openings, but kept getting turned down. Then, last Sunday morning, Army coach Joe Alberici reached out to him. The Black Knights\u2019 game against Massachusetts had been canceled and one of his players heard during a television broadcast that UVa might still be looking for an opponent. Tiffany said the game between the two schools came together in about five hours. \u201cGive a lot of credit to both administrations,\u201d said Tiffany of the rapid scheduling. \u201cI think both of us are thrilled to have an opportunity to play such a high-level game.\u201d Sunday\u2019s matchup with the Black Knights, the first between the two schools since 1985, will test the Cavaliers\u2019 edge even further. Tiffany hopes his club builds off its effort in the opener. \u201cI was happy on game day at [home] against Towson, the men were able to prove that this is who we are and this is who we\u2019ve been,\u201d said Tiffany. \u201cTalk about a physical team, a tenacious team, a team that\u2019s not going to back down from anyone, that\u2019s this next opponent.\u201d With that in mind, Tiffany said he\u2019s continued the physical approach to practice this week, a push his players both respect and understand. \u201cHe had a right to be concerned after Lynchburg,\u201d said Kology. NOTE: Tiffany said senior attackman Matt Moore, who missed the Towson game, is expected to be available against Army.","746":"With 11 months since the Virginia softball team\u2019s last away game, head coach Joanna Hardin almost forgot what it was like to hit the road for a weekend series. \u201cI haven\u2019t traveled outside of Charlottesville in 11 months,\u201d Hardin laughed. \u201cI had to go look for my suitcase.\u201d Fortunately, Hardin located her travel essentials ahead of her team\u2019s season-opening road trip. Virginia opens its season Saturday in Athens, Georgia, with games against Georgia and South Alabama. The Cavaliers play each team on both Saturday and Sunday. The series opens the team\u2019s 50-game spring schedule, which includes 40 games against ACC foes. It\u2019s a challenging schedule for a team that hasn\u2019t posted a winning record since going 26-25 in 2012. Hardin feels hopeful about her team, which brings in a freshman class with three top-100 recruits and returns nearly all of its production from last season. The 2020 roster included just one senior, pitcher Riley Wilkinson, who wasn\u2019t used in a primary role for the Cavaliers. With no fall schedule, Hardin focused on intrasquad scrimmages in recent months to promote competition and development among the team. She liked what she saw. \u201cOur \u2018A\u2019 team has changed a lot over the last six or seven months,\u201d Hardin said. \u201cIt\u2019s been really, really competitive.\u201d UVa\u2019s roster includes seven pitchers, which gives the team depth and different options to manage the schedule. Aly Rayle enters the year as the team\u2019s presumptive ace. Rayle, a junior, led Virginia with a 2.91 ERA in her 14 appearances last season. That\u2019s the lowest ERA posted by any UVa softball pitcher since Melanie Mitchell in 2013. Sophomore Molly Grube, a Chesterfield native and the 2019 Richmond-Times Dispatch All-Metro Player of the Year, played well in her limited 2020 chances, posting a 3.63 ERA over 46 1\/3 innings. Outside of Rayle, opportunities are largely up for grabs. It\u2019s likely the Cavaliers will try out multiple pitchers alongside Rayle to start the season, forcing the team\u2019s catchers to learn the strengths and weaknesses of each pitcher. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely different to be like \u2018OK, well I haven\u2019t caught her in like two weeks, so let me think about what she was working on two weeks ago,\u2019\u201d redshirt junior catcher Ashley Jennings said. \u201cIt\u2019s important that we communicate as catchers and really know what this pitcher is working on.\u201d Jennings stressed that the different pitchers boast different strengths. For some, they rely on spins. Others lean on velocity. Knowing what each pitcher brings changes how Jennings plays behind the plate. While the pitching potential seems promising, Hardin holds plenty of choices for her lineup. Junior Donna Friedman led the team with a .324 batting average in 2020 and tied for the team lead with three home runs. Kate Covington, a senior, is as reliable as any player on UVa\u2019s roster. She\u2019s started 122 games over the past three seasons, showcasing promise as an outfielder and a batter. She\u2019s among the upperclassmen likely to take on a leadership role for the team. Other names to watch include junior outfielder Bailey Winscott, who led the team with seven steals in 2020. Tori Gilbert, another junior outfielder, stole five bases and launched three home runs last spring. Arizona Ritchie, a junior infielder, figures to earn at least some playing time for her speed and defensive ability. Jennings seems destined to earn time at catcher. Regardless of who takes the field this weekend and beyond, UVa\u2019s players are excited for the chance to play. \u201cWe\u2019ve been grinding behind the scenes for months now, so we\u2019re super excited to show that out on the field now,\u201d Jennings said. While UVa fans won\u2019t fill into Palmer Park this spring \u2014 the program is only allowing family of student-athletes and coaches to attend home games due to COVID-19 restrictions \u2014 the team\u2019s facility still gives the team a lift as it aims to become an ACC contender. Social distancing inside a facility with team meeting rooms, a locker room and an indoor batting cage makes preparing in groups significantly easier than it would\u2019ve been in previous seasons. \u201cIt will be the difference in our season and our preparation,\u201d Hardin said. \u201cWe\u2019re just so, so, so grateful. It\u2019s hard to even articulate how valuable this is for us and for our team.\u201d Hardin appreciates the facility, even if she has to wait a little longer for packed crowds. After going most of last spring without softball, UVa players are happy to follow health precautions as it means they can compete in games again. \u201cThe fact that we\u2019re here is really, really gratifying, considering how challenging the last 11 months have been for our squad,\u201d Hardin said. \u201cWe\u2019re so excited, really grateful and not taking it for granted that\u2019s for sure.\u201d","747":"As I look back over the past 11 months, I\u2019m reminded of the many generous neighbors who, despite the challenges of this seemingly endless pandemic, continue to help create such a wonderful environment for so many of us outdoor runners and walkers. I\u2019d like to take a moment to publicly thank some of these special folks, who have continued to afford us the countless opportunities to safely and comfortably exercise on foot in our beautiful community and all for free! Here just a small sampling of these selfless exercise shepherds. * Charlottesville High School\u2019s Rodney Redd and Eric Irizarry, who have kept the gates of their beautiful Curtis Elder Track & Field Complex open throughout the entire pandemic. Other local athletic directors, such as Albemarle\u2019s Deb Tyson and Western Albemarle\u2019s Steve Heon, also have kindly opened their school tracks for public use. * The Rivanna Trails Foundation (RTF) has continually groomed the 20-plus miles of soft-surface paths of our community\u2019s urban greenbelt for our in-town \"Appalachian Trail\u201d experience. * The City of Charlottesville\u2019s Chris Gensic and Albemarle County\u2019s Bob Crickenberger, whose Park and Rec Departments have kept the countless miles of beautiful trails of our community parks, such as Ragged Mountain, Patricia Byrom and Preddy Creek, open and in great condition for our exercise pleasure. * The residents of beautiful country roads such as Ridge, Sugar Hollow, Wesley Chapel and Dick Woods have so kindly and patiently exhibited neighborly behavior to the countless folks who have enjoyed the peace and serenity of exercising out in the countryside. * The White Hall Ruritans Club and The Miller School have so kindly opened their property for parking to us on-foot exercisers. * The Charlottesville Track Club (CTC) and volunteer members such as Leah Connor, Suzanna Turanyi and Audrey Sackson have freely given their time, energy and expertise throughout the pandemic to help organize several local running and walking events, which have in turn raised more than $125,000 for our neighbors in need. * Mary Blankemeier, Maddie Rennyson and their fellow UVa track and field athletes, through their free Run Your City program, continue to give their time in enthusiastically energizing so many kids in our community. * Reynolds Cowles and his fellow Foxfield Board of Directors kindly opened the stunning 170-acre property for three running events, all with safe pandemic protocols in place. In turn, these races have raised more than $100,000 for several worthy community causes. There are more Foxfield venue events to come, including the 10 Miler (see below). * The organizers of Prolyfyck Run Crew have created a greater sense of community with their weekly runs through the city. * Julie Roller and our neighbors at Monticello have continued to meticulously groom the popular Saunders-Monticello Trail and other wooded trails in providing us a unique on-foot experience leading to Jefferson\u2019s magnificent mountain top estate. * UVa doctors Bob Wilder, Siobahn Statuta and Dave Hryvniak have so graciously given their time and medical expertise at our local races, affording so many collegiate and community runners a safe way to compete. * The University of Virginia has beautifully brought back to life the endless labyrinth of paths at Foxhaven Farm. What a legacy to the amazing Jane Heyward, who created the trails throughout her lifetime of walking that stunning, close-to-town property. * Many folks, such as the Nelson County Parks and Recreation department, Paul Collinge and Mary Lyons, are responsible for reopening the path through the magnificent Blue Ridge Tunnel. Simply amazing! Tip: This historic and beautiful walk through time is best experienced at dawn, when the crowds are sparse. * David Smith and Matt Smythe and CATS for all their ongoing efforts in advocating and supporting the use of our vast network of public trails. * Peter Krebs, Rex Linville and the PEC bring endless determination, dedication and commitment to create as many public pathways to our community. We are so grateful to all of these wonderful folks and to so many more, who have kept us comfortably on our feet for so many miles throughout the past year. Running notes * Vin Lananna, UVa\u2019s wonderful cross country and track and field coach, is always looking for ways to positively connect his program to the community. Starting in March, he and his athletes will be kicking off a monthly town hall of sorts. The goal is for alumni and neighbors to come together with current UVa athletes, via Zoom, to talk about everything track and field and cross country.\u00a0Lananna's first community get together is March 9. More detailed information will be posted on the Charlottesville Track Club and Ragged Mountain sites in late February. * The RaceFest 2021 series is off to a great start with more than 300 folks already participating. Every time you finish an event, you earn five points, with the opportunity of picking up extra points depending on your age group finish. It\u2019s not too late to join the fun. There are still seven more events between now and early June. All nine of the races are for wonderful community causes, like PACHEM, Big Brothers-Big Sisters and the Virginia Institute of Autism. Next up in the series: The Haven 8K on March 6. Go to charlottesvbulletrackclub.org for more information on this fun local series. Current point leaders in the RaceFest Series, after two events, include Ann Mazur, Kendall Tata, Andrea Wright, Owen Shifflett, Bob Johnson, Bonnie Wilfore, Harry Landers, Linda Scandore, Kate Lucas and Jeffrey Plank. * One of the jewels of the nine-event RaceFest series is The Charlottesville 10 Miler, our area\u2019s oldest footrace. This year\u2019s pandemic edition of this popular iconic community event will be held over the finely groomed grass paths of beautiful Foxfield on the weekend of March 27-28. We know that it\u2019s outside-the-box thinking for an event that has always been held on the roads but, as they say, the race must go on! * The Ragged Mountain Cup, with a new pandemic format, will once again kick off the high school cross country season, but this time around, this popular event will be held in mid-March instead of it\u2019s traditional late summer date. It's the same two-mile distance, same beautiful Panorama Farms location but with a new pandemic format to start the spring harrier season.","748":"During the week, North Carolina coach Roy Williams told media members his team hoped to get Virginia senior forward Jay Huff into a foul trouble in their upcoming matchup. Huff\u2019s father saw those comments on Twitter and made sure to let his son know to expect. Saturday night, Huff scored 18 points and grabbed 12 rebounds for his second double-double of the season. And he did it all while committing just a single second-half foul. \u201cI was definitely proud of the one foul,\u201d said Huff. \u201c[My dad] sent me something where UNC\u2019s plan was to get me in foul trouble, which is understandable, because I've had some games this year where that\u2019s been a problem. Luckily, we were able to avoid that.\u201d Huff and fellow forward Sam Hauser, who scored 17, combined to lead No. 9 UVa to a 60-48 win at John Paul Jones Arena, the Cavaliers seventh straight win over UNC. Going into the game, Williams had called the face-off with first-place Virginia\u00a0\u2014 and Huff and Hauser, a pair of slick-shooting frontcourt players\u00a0\u2014 \u201cthe biggest challenge\u201d his team would face this season. Saturday night, his concern proved warranted. The duo hit seven of their team\u2019s 10 3-pointers, stretching Carolina\u2019s defense to create space and opportunity for each other to operate. Virginia (15-3, 11-1 ACC) took control early against Williams\u2019 Tar Heels and never looked back, using a 21-2 run to take the lead, and its defense and ball security to make sure it stayed out front. \u201cThey were a little cold and we got into a rhythm offensively,\u201d said UVa coach Tony Bennett. \u201cThen we got that separation.\u201d Just like a year ago, when UVa ended the season with eight straight wins heading into the ACC Tournament, which was canceled before the Cavaliers could play a game, Bennett\u2019s club is heating up down the stretch. Virginia has won four in a row and still sits atop the ACC standings, a game ahead of Florida State, which it plays on Monday night in Tallahassee, Fla. And, as usual, the biggest reason has been its defense. Its last time out, UNC (12-7, 7-5) scored 50 points in the second half of its win over rival Duke. Saturday, the Tar Heels failed to hit that total for the entire game, struggling to hit shots or score in transition against the ACC\u2019s top defensive team. \u201cWhen we\u2019re playing great defense, I feel like our offense is much better,\u201d said freshman guard Reece Beekman, who had seven assists. \u201cComing from defense and that leading to the offense, that\u2019s what helped us. When a couple of shots go in, we get more energy and that leads to defense, too. It all comes back to the defensive department.\u201d Virginia, which had seen its turnover total go up in each of its previous four games \u2014 from nine against Virginia Tech on Jan. 30, to 11 against North Carolina State, 12 against Pittsburgh and then 17 the last time out against Georgia Tech \u2014 was far better with the basketball Saturday night. It committed just six turnovers against the Heels and assisted on 16 of 19 baskets. After scoring 41 first-half points in its last game, the 91-87 road win over the Blue Devils, the Tar Heels managed a season-low 18 points before the break Saturday at Virginia. UVa and UNC opened a combined 0-for-8 shooting, and neither team scored for the first 2:45. Carolina was first on the board when Caleb Love picked off a pass from Beekman and took it for a fast-break dunk. The Cavaliers didn\u2019t get on the board for the first 3:29, finally scoring on a catch-and-shoot 3-pointer from Huff. That play started the 21-2 run for Virginia as it built a lead it would hold the rest of the night. UVa went up by as many as 17, taking a 21-4 lead on a 3-pointer by Tomas Woldetensae 10:09 before the break. But in a cold stretch for the Virginia offense, it missed eight straight shots and the Heels took advantage, using an 8-0 run to close to 22-15. The Cavs didn\u2019t score for the final 4:18 of the half, missing 11 of their last 12 shots before the break and headed to the locker room up 27-18. North Carolina shot 25% in the first half, going 0 for 9 beyond the 3-point arc. The Tar Heels were better in the second half, but never got closer than 9 points to Virginia after the break. Trey Murphy III hit a 3-pointer from the wing with 3:09 to play to put UVA up 56-42 and effectively put the game away. Carolina hadn\u2019t played since the Duke win. Its game against Miami on Monday was postponed after a video surfaced showing players celebrating the victory at a party without wearing masks. Williams said the team handled its discipline internally, and the players involved \u2014 including Richmond native Armando Bacot \u2014 were not suspended. About an hour before tipoff, the Tar Heels learned that their next game \u2014 at home Tuesday against No. 20 Virginia Tech \u2014 had been postponed because of a COVID-19 outbreak in the Hokies\u2019 program. Once the game started, UVa did what Williams had elected not to \u2013 publicly punishing the Tar Heels. And as he had feared, Huff and Hauser were a big part of it.\u200b","749":"When the Virginia men\u2019s basketball schedule was released, the team\u2019s stretch from Feb. 13-20 seemed critical. A Saturday game against North Carolina was followed by a Monday battle with Florida State, the 2020 ACC champion. A few days later, UVa would visit Duke for a Saturday showdown. North Carolina and Duke haven\u2019t lived up to their preseason billing and both teams sit on the NCAA Tournament bubble. Florida State, however, is every bit as good as advertised. After trouncing UNC 60-48 on Saturday, No. 9 Virginia travels to Tallahassee for a Monday night matchup with the No. 17 Seminoles, who sit in second place in the ACC standings behind the Cavaliers. A Monday game means a quick turnaround for both squads, who competed Saturday. \u201cI think the first-years will have to get used to that,\u201d redshirt senior center Jay Huff said of the short turnaround. \u201cThat\u2019s something they\u2019ll have to learn is there\u2019s no breaks in the ACC, and a team like FSU no matter what year it is, they\u2019re always solid.\u201d Huff, who recorded a double-double in the win over North Carolina, shared that with fewer than 48 hours between games, most of the preparation for the Seminoles comes through strategy discussions and film study. There\u2019s not significant time to prepare for Florida State on the court. UVa\u2019s other Monday ACC game this season came on Jan. 25, and the Wahoos destroyed Syracuse\u2019s zone defense in an 81-58 win. The situation with the Orange differed from this turnaround. UVa\u2019s previous Saturday to Monday turnaround featured consecutive home games against Georgia Tech and Syracuse. Monday\u2019s game against Florida State takes place on the road. In the week leading up to the games with Georgia Tech and Syracuse, the Cavaliers didn\u2019t play any midweek games due to COVID-19 scheduling alterations. That gave the team time to prepare for both Georgia Tech and Syracuse. While it\u2019s a different Monday test this time around for Virginia, Florida State sits in a similar position. The Seminoles will host the Cavaliers, but it\u2019s still a quick turnaround, especially for a team recently coming off a COVID-19 pause. FSU defeated Wake Forest on Saturday, and the overtime win was the Seminoles\u2019 first game in February. Much like UVa, FSU plans on relying mostly on film study and a Sunday walkthrough to prepare for its Monday opponent. \u201cVirginia is probably one of the best teams in America in terms of execution, offensively and defensively,\u201d FSU head coach Leonard Hamilton said Saturday. \u201cWe have to be aware of what they\u2019re doing. We won\u2019t have the luxury of going out there and drilling it, so we\u2019re going to have to rely on it being mental.\u201d When the game starts Monday, the on-court battle will pin two unique programs against each other. UVa uses a small rotation, relying on its signature Pack Line defense and efficient offensive action to beat teams. The Cavaliers have held their last two foes to season-low scoring totals. Both UNC on Saturday and Georgia Tech on Wednesday failed to reach 50 points. \u201cThat\u2019s always the goal, to make that opponent earn a quality shot,\u201d Virginia coach Tony Bennett said Saturday. \u201cIt\u2019s gotta be contested, and the majority of them were. We won the majority of the possessions, so it looked better the last two games. Now we\u2019ll have a great opportunity to test it against obviously an excellent team on Monday night.\u201d Florida State uses a much deeper rotation than most ACC squads, relying on exceptional length at every position. Nine FSU players average at least 13 minutes per game this season, but no player averages more than 30 minutes. Depth, size and length help make the Seminoles a top-50 team offensively and defensively, according to KenPom\u2019s efficiency rankings. The Seminoles are sound defensively, and they\u2019re also one of the best offensive teams in the country. In ACC play, FSU leads the conference in points per game (80.4), 3-point shooting percentage (41.8%) and field goal shooting percentage (50.2%). The Seminoles have been the most efficient offense in the conference since ACC play began. \u201cThey\u2019re really good,\u201d Bennett said. \u201cCoach Hamilton does a real good job, great job and their depth, they have great depth, play a lot of guys, [they] play hard.\u201d Eight Florida State players average at least five points per game. Five of them average nine points per contest, with senior guard M.J. Walker leading the way by scoring 13.7 points per game. Even with sophomore center Balsa Koprivica\u2019s status in doubt after he rolled his ankle warming up for the Wake Forest game, Florida State possesses exceptional size and offensive talent at all five positions. With Bennett and Hamilton having coached against each other for more than a decade, there shouldn\u2019t be major surprises Monday. \u201cThey do what they do and if you can stop it, you can win and if you can\u2019t stop them, they are going to score,\u201d Hamilton said. Sticking to what\u2019s worked in the past is leading to results again this season for both the Cavaliers and Seminoles. When FSU and Virginia meet Monday, they\u2019ll do so atop the ACC standings. That\u2019s no surprise to ACC basketball fans.","750":"Virginia Tech men\u2019s basketball coach Mike Young said Monday that \u201ca couple people\u201d in his program have tested positive for COVID-19 and that \u201ctoo many\u201d players are in quarantine. The ACC and Virginia Tech had announced Saturday that the Hokies\u2019 game Tuesday at North Carolina has been postponed because of a positive test and subsequent quarantining and contact tracing within the Tech program. Virginia Tech\u2019s next scheduled game is Saturday at No. 16 Florida State, but Young said Monday he is unsure if the No. 18 Hokies (14-4, 8-3 ACC) will be able to play that game. \u201cI am sick to my stomach,\u201d Young said Monday on the ACC coaches\u2019 weekly video conference. \u201cHere we are mid-February and I\u2019ve got a good basketball team. I\u2019m having the time of my life coaching this team. To have an interruption, disruption, \u2026 is concerning. \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate, but there\u2019s not a thing we can do about it. We know this thing doesn\u2019t discriminate. It\u2019s tough.\u201d Although the ACC and Tech announcements last Saturday had referred to just one positive test, Young said Monday that a couple people in the program had tested positive. When asked if those people are doing OK, Young said, \u201cYes.\u201d Neither person who tested positive is a player, but the players have been affected by the subsequent contact tracing and quarantining. \u201cI haven\u2019t had a player test positive, but the contact tracing is there for a reason,\u201d Young said. \u201cThat\u2019s where our difficulties are and continue to be.\u201d Young said the Hokies are still able to hold practice. \u201cWe can practice. Not very well, but we can practice,\u201d Young said. When asked how many players were in quarantine and unable to practice, Young said, \u201ctoo many.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t want to get into particulars,\u201d Young said. Young, whose team was idle last week, said Tech realized last Tuesday or Wednesday that it had a COVID-19 issue. \u201cYou hold your breath that you don\u2019t get hit with the contact tracing. Maybe that\u2019s inevitable. And we got hit by it,\u201d Young said. \u201cWhen we all came to the realization \u2026 Tuesday, Wednesday, whenever it was, that we were going to have to shut down for a bit \u2014 when you look around and not many people [are] there \u2014 that was sobering for all of us. \u201cBut \u2026 you fight on with those that you have and hope like crazy you can get these guys back and continue what has been a really good season to this point.\u201d Young said there was no chance Tech would have as many as 10 players available for practice Monday. \u201cI had six as of last week,\u201d Young said. \u201cI\u2019m not real sure what I\u2019ll have today at 1 o\u2019clock when we go.\u201d This is the first time this season that anyone in Young\u2019s program has tested positive. \u201cWe\u2019ve been so fortunate and incredibly blessed throughout the year to avoid this thing. Unfortunately, we had a couple people within our Tier 1 group that tested positive,\u201d Young said. \u201cAs a result of the contact tracing, our health department imposed a quarantining for those that they came in contact with. \u201cWe will continue to test this week.\u201d The NCAA deems Tier 1 individuals in a program to be coaches, athletes, trainers, physical therapists, medical staff and equipment staff. The Hokies did not play last week, but that was because of opponents\u2019 COVID-19 issues. Tech was supposed to host Florida State last Tuesday, but that game was postponed on Feb. 1 because of FSU\u2019s COVID-19 issues. The Hokies were supposed to host Louisville last weekend, but that game was postponed last Wednesday because of Louisville\u2019s COVID-19 issues. Tuesday\u2019s game at UNC marks the fifth time this season that Young\u2019s team has had an ACC game postponed. A Jan. 2 game at Virginia was postponed because of UVa\u2019s COVID-19 issues, while a Jan. 20 game was postponed because of Boston College\u2019s COVID-19 issues. Only one of those five games has been rescheduled. Last weekend\u2019s game against Louisville was moved to March 3. Young said he hopes Tech has an opportunity to make up another game. \u201cI\u2019m not sure where that opportunity is going to be,\u201d Young said. \u201cTo play three games in a week, I had to do that some in the Southern Conference [when Young coached Wofford] and that\u2019s no fun. \u201cThere\u2019s no way we can make up three or four of the games that we\u2019ve had postponed. \u2026 Will we have an opportunity to make up one? Maybe so. But I haven\u2019t heard a lot about that.\u201d The UNC game becomes the seventh Virginia Tech sporting event this school year that has been postponed because of a positive test or tests in a Tech program and subsequent quarantining and contract tracing, including a Sept. 19 football game against UVa; a men\u2019s soccer game against UVa in October; and four women\u2019s volleyball matches in October.","751":"COVID-19 remains a threat to cancel or postpone games, but athletic programs across the country continue competing. The virus, coupled with a desire to play games, makes for days with contrasting news. Monday was one of those days. In the University of Virginia sports community, a sporting event scheduled for Friday was canceled due to the virus. Later in the day, a fall sports program announced an eight-game spring schedule. Also scattered into the busy news day was the announcement of the latest men\u2019s basketball AP top 25 poll, which kept UVa in the top 10 after a productive week. UVa\u2019s athletic department also shared its latest COVID-19 testing numbers Monday. The department administered 1,871 COVID-19 tests from Feb. 8-14. Of those tests, 33 were positive for the virus. Since the athletic department started testing student-athletes and staff members on July 5, 21,311 tests have been administered. Of those tests 179 have been positive for the virus. Volleyball match canceled On Monday, the Virginia volleyball team announced the cancellation of its lone spring nonconference match. The Cavaliers were scheduled to host UMBC on Friday, but canceled the match due to COVID-19 issues within their program. The match won\u2019t be rescheduled. The Cavaliers, who went 1-8 in the fall, are next scheduled to play at Pittsburgh on March 6. The match against the Panthers begins a 10-game ACC slate this spring. The cancellation due to COVID-19 issues was announced Monday, which gives the Cavaliers nearly three weeks to get healthy before playing Pitt in early March. Men\u2019s basketball moves up rankings Wins over Georgia Tech and North Carolina helped propel the Virginia men\u2019s basketball team higher in the latest Associated Press Top 25 poll. The Cavaliers came in at No. 7 this week, up from the No. 9 spot they occupied last week. Tony Bennett\u2019s team is the highest ranked team in the ACC, and the only conference program inside the top 10. Florida State sits at No. 16 in the rankings, while Virginia Tech is ranked 18th. Louisville, Clemson and North Carolina received votes but didn\u2019t crack into the rankings. This is the first time all season UVa has been in the top 10 of the poll in consecutive weeks. The Cavaliers started the season at No. 4 in the preseason poll before falling outside the top 10 following a loss to San Francisco in the first week of the season. UVa lost to Virginia Tech after climbing back into the top 10 in late January. The Wahoos\u2019 winning streak keeps them in the top 10 for consecutive weeks. The team\u2019s No. 7 ranking is its best mark since being named the No. 4 team this preseason. Spring soccer schedules The Virginia women\u2019s soccer team announced its spring schedule last week, and the men\u2019s soccer team shared its spring slate Monday. The women will play five games and one exhibition against an NWSL opponent. All five matches are nonconference matchups. The Cavaliers open play on Feb. 28 at George Mason. They face VCU on March 6 and Old Dominion on March 14. On March 27, UVa competes against the North Carolina Courage, an NWSL team. The exhibition against the professional foe won\u2019t count, but it gives UVa\u2019s players a chance to test themselves against elite competition while also giving the professional team an up-close look at some of the Cavaliers\u2019 stars. The UVa women\u2019s soccer team finishes its spring schedule with two games against West Virginia. The Cavaliers play the Mountaineers on the road on April 3 before hosting them on April 10. NCAA Tournament selections will be announced on April 18. Unlike the women\u2019s program, the men\u2019s team\u2019s spring schedule features ACC games. After an exhibition with Virginia Tech on Feb. 22, UVa hosts George Mason on March 2. The Cavaliers begin ACC action this spring against Notre Dame on March 7. Games with UNC, Virginia Tech and Central Arkansas and Duke round out Virginia\u2019s March schedule. The Tar Heels come to Charlottesville on March 13, before UVa hosts the Hokies on March 19, the Bears on March 23 and the Blue Devils on March 28. Virginia plays at Louisville on April 2 before going to Pitt on April 8. The ACC Coastal and Atlantic division champions will meet on April 13. The winner of the April 13 game plays Clemson in the ACC Championship on April 17 for the league\u2019s automatic berth into the NCAA Tournament.","752":"The No. 16 Virginia women\u2019s lacrosse team saw 12 different players score goals in its 21-6 win over East Carolina on Monday at the UVa Lower Turf Field. The strong offensive showing ended with Virginia scoring 20 goals in a game for the first time since a 20-9 win over George Mason in 2019. Ashlyn McGovern led the Cavaliers (1-0) with four goals. Lillie Kloak added three goals, while Mackenzie Hoeg chipped in two goals, two assists and a team-high eight draw controls. Defensively, Jalen Knight had three caused turnovers and two ground balls, while goalkeeper Charlie Campbell scooped up three ground balls. Virginia led in draw controls (19-10) and was 5-for-7 on free position shots. Megan Pallozzi led ECU (1-1) with three goals and one assist. \u201cI think our team did a great job,\u201d Virginia coach Julie Myers said. \u201cWe started strong and just kept going. Everyone was able to contribute to a team win against a solid opponent in ECU.\u201d Virginia opened the scoring with a goal from Annie Dyson Kloak that kicked off a 4-0 Cavaliers run to start the game. ECU scored at the 24:58 mark in the first half to end UVa\u2019s opening spurt. McGovern completed a hat trick in the first 10 minutes of the game, scoring two of the first three goals during a 16-0 Virginia run that included tallies from Aubrey Williams, Jaime Biskup, Kiki Shaw, Chloe Jones, Katie Railey, Morgan Schwab and Braeden Dial. Maggie Bostain scored UVa\u2019s final goal of the game with five minutes to play. Virginia travels to No. 14 Richmond on Friday for a 4 p.m. matchup at Robins Stadium. The game will be streamed on ESPN+. After seeing last season end abruptly due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Myers is happy to have her team competing again. \u201cIt is a great starting point after almost a year off,\u201d Myers said. \u201cWe are looking forward to just playing again and getting back out to practice tomorrow.\u201d","753":"Monday\u2019s game was hyped up as the ACC men\u2019s basketball \u201cgame of the year.\u201d No. 7 Virginia and No. 16 Florida State were expected to battle in a nationally televised contest. The Seminoles got the memo. UVa, however, left its best back in Charlottesville. It was a disappointing road showing Monday for Tony Bennett\u2019s team, which fell 81-60 to the Seminoles. Virginia drops to 15-4 on the season, sporting an 11-2 mark in ACC games. Florida State improves to 12-3 overall and 8-2 in league play. Here are three rapid takeaways from UVa\u2019s second conference defeat. Lapses continue against ranked teams With Monday\u2019s loss, UVa dropped to 0-3 against teams currently ranked in the AP Top 25. The Cavaliers were blown out by Gonzaga on Dec. 26, losing 98-75 in a game that largely wasn\u2019t competitive. The undefeated Zags are the nation\u2019s No. 1 team. On Jan. 30, Virginia Tech defeated UVa 65-51 behind a surge in the final 10 minutes. The Hokies are currently ranked 18th. On Monday, the Seminoles jumped all over UVa. No. 16 Florida State went on a 20-3 run after falling behind 6-2, and they used that run to control the first half. The Seminoles led by 20 points at the break. UVa didn\u2019t give up, even facing the massive deficit. It opened the second half on an 11-3 run, but the Seminoles responded with a run of its own to stretch the lead back to 20 points with 10 minutes left in the second half. It\u2019s another double-digit loss against a team currently in the top 25 of the AP poll. There\u2019s no shame in losing to ranked teams, but the Cavaliers have fallen well short in a few of their best opportunities to beat quality teams. The reigning national champions are good enough to beat ranked teams and beating ranked teams is the standard in Charlottesville. Virginia needs to improve over the next month as it gears up for a potential Final Four run that would likely include games with top-25 caliber teams. Defense struggles UVa\u2019s defense played exceptionally well against Georgia Tech and North Carolina last week, allowing just 49 points to the Yellow Jackets and 48 points to the Tar Heels. Florida State scored 45 points in the first half Monday night. Virginia allowed 44 points in the first half of its loss to Gonzaga in December. The Seminoles surpassed Gonzaga\u2019s first-half scoring mark, becoming the only team to score 45 points in a first half against UVa this season. Leonard Hamilton\u2019s team boasts incredible length and athleticism, and it led to good looks on offense. The Seminoles shot 53.3% from the floor and 60% from 3-point range in the first half. They racked up nine assists and only turned the ball over three times in the opening 20 minutes. For the game, FSU shot 50% and tallied 17 assists to just five turnovers. The Seminoles were effective offensively, and the Cavaliers weren\u2019t thrilled with the defensive effort. FSU\u2019s home ACC winning streak improves to 24 games thanks to the Seminoles\u2019 stellar offensive showing against Virginia\u2019s vaunted defense. ACC regular-season title in doubt With just one ACC loss coming into Monday night\u2019s matchup, UVa was well on its way toward winning the conference\u2019s regular-season title. Florida State put that possibility in jeopardy. The Seminoles moved to 8-2 in the ACC by beating Virginia, tying the Cavaliers in the loss column. Frequent schedule alterations caused by COVID-19 makes the ACC race tough to track, and it\u2019s likely that teams at the top won\u2019t finish their full 20-game conference schedules. With FSU and Virginia Tech (8-3 ACC) both in the mix at the top of the conference standings, UVa needs to finish the season strong to earn the No. 1 seed in the ACC Tournament. The Seminoles and Hokies both beat Virginia, giving them the advantage in a potential head-to-head tiebreaker. Virginia is scheduled to finish its regular season against Duke, N.C. State, Miami and Louisville. The Cardinals are 6-3 in the league. The Cavaliers face Duke on the road Saturday night.","754":"In Brian O\u2019Connor\u2019s eyes, Andrew Abbott is a Major Leaguer wearing a Virginia uniform. The hard-throwing left-hander decided to return to the Cavaliers for the 2021 baseball season after going undrafted in the shortened 2020 MLB Draft. In a typical season, Abbott was a sure-fire bet to be picked in the draft. Instead, UVa will move the pitcher from the bullpen into its starting rotation to try to maximize Abbott\u2019s impact this season. \u201cThe kid should be in professional baseball right now,\u201d O\u2019Connor, UVa\u2019s head coach, said. \u201cThe uniqueness of the draft did not treat him well. He\u2019s over that, but he\u2019s earned it and proven to his teammates that he can do this role and needs to do it. It\u2019s the right thing in every facet.\u201d After not being selected in the five-round MLB Draft this spring, Abbott elected to come back to Charlottesville for a final season. Abbott is not the only UVa player to decide to stick around, which made the decision to move him into the starting rotation even easier for O\u2019Connor. Senior pitcher Griff McGarry likely would\u2019ve been picked if the MLB Draft went its usual 40 rounds. Instead, he\u2019s back as a returning starter after posting a 1.35 ERA across 20 innings in 2020. Stephen Schoch, a graduate student, planned on finishing his collegiate career last season. The NCAA granted eligibility relief, so the UMBC transfer turned UVa closer will stay in Charlottesville for a final year. He ranked second in the ACC with five saves in 2020. Senior pitcher Kyle Whitten and graduate student Paul Kosanovich provide additional depth at the back of UVa\u2019s bullpen. With so many proven options at reliever, O\u2019Connor wanted to put Abbott in a spot where he could best impact the team. That led to Abbott entering the starting rotation alongside players such as McGarry, junior Mike Vasil and freshman Nate Savino. Abbott, who posted a 1.35 ERA in 13 1\/3 innings in 2020, says he\u2019s happy in the rotation or bullpen, as long as it leads to success. \u201cHonestly, I just want to pitch,\u201d Abbott said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t really matter to me, just help the team win. At the end of the day, that\u2019s the biggest thing.\u201d He spent the fall ramping up his pitching load as he aims to enter the rotation. Instead of throwing an inning or two and maybe 15-30 pitches, Abbott will be asked to go 5-7 innings and toss 75-100 pitches depending on the game. It\u2019s a change, but one Abbott \u2014 who led ACC relievers with 28 strikeouts last season \u2014 is ready to embrace. To prepare for his increased pitch load, Abbott slowly worked up to throwing more pitches during games in the fall. He also used long-toss drills and threw with weighted balls to build up his arm strength. \u201cStarting is more getting elongated, working longer, throwing more pitches, being able to go deeper in games,\u201d Abbott said. \u201cThat\u2019s the main difference between the two.\u201d O\u2019Connor credited Abbott with developing complementary pitches this offseason. Abbott\u2019s fastball and curveball have been effective in the past, but he\u2019s tried to add more to his repertoire over the offseason to help with the transition to the rotation. Abbott and the returning group of pitchers will throw to a familiar face in Logan Michaels. The graduate student from Wisconsin, who decided to return for another season, is excited about the possibility of working with such talented pitchers. The catcher feels he knows Abbott and others well and can help maximize their talent. \u201cI know with certain guys what I need to say to get them back on track or like certain cues for them to get back locked in,\u201d Michaels said. With a veteran like Michaels behind the plate and an abundance of talent in the rotation and bullpen, O\u2019Connor feels confident in the possibilities for his group of pitchers. The Cavaliers were seventh in the ACC last spring with a team ERA of 3.39. Virginia faces a problem most coaches would love to have. How will it spread out innings among all of its talented pitching options? The Cavaliers\u2019 excess depth allows them to move Abbott to their starting rotation. With COVID-19 and contract tracing measures potentially sidelining players for weeks at a time, that additional depth may prove valuable this spring. \u201cThere\u2019s no question because of the possibility of things happening throughout the year, the depth in the pitching staff, the depth in potential starters is, I think, really vital and going to play into every team\u2019s success or lack of success from the wins and losses standpoint,\u201d O\u2019Connor said. It\u2019s unusual for a player of Abbott\u2019s caliber to be back in college, but the Cavaliers won\u2019t complain. They\u2019re excited to give the experienced standout a new challenge this spring.","755":"Hank Coleman was sitting in his Richmond home back in December, on a conference call from work, when he heard the ruckus. Car horns were honking and his wife was screaming. \u201cI said, \u2018Oh man. Somebody must\u2019ve hit somebody,\u201d said Hank. Instead, the commotion signaled good news. The Colemans\u2019 son, Henry, a freshman basketball player at Duke, was home for the holidays. Cynthia Coleman hit her horn, then jumped out of her truck to greet her son. Henry honked his horn. Alarmed neighbors looked out their doors and windows. \u201cThat was Henry\u2019s welcome home,\u201d said Cynthia. With COVID-19 protocols keeping players isolated on Duke\u2019s campus, and the school not allowing fans at home games, the Colemans had not spent any time with Henry \u2014 the former Trinity Episcopal star \u2014 in months, not since the three hours they had to move him into his room at the school\u2019s Washington Inn, where basketball players are being housed this year. That\u2019s why, after its Dec. 19 game against Gardner-Webb was canceled, Duke \u2014 which hosts No. 7 Virginia on Saturday \u2014 decided to keep a stretch of days around Christmas clear on its schedule, allowing players to go home for a holiday break before resuming. \u201cIt was a good time period,\u201d said the 6-foot-7, 229-pound Henry. \u201cYou want to see family. You\u2019re excited to see family. For most of us, we haven\u2019t seen our family the entire year and it\u2019s been a difficult stretch. That\u2019s part of playing college basketball and that\u2019s part of the commitment you have to make.\u201d Coleman spent the time at home with his parents and younger brother, eating a menu of meals he requested and watching college football. Other than a visit from one aunt, that was the extent of his time in Richmond. \u201cI was just at the house with my family,\u201d he said. \u201cThat was everything that I needed.\u201d Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski said he supports the university\u2019s no-fan policy at Cameron Indoor Stadium this season, but noted, coupled with the team\u2019s COVID-19 safety protocols, it\u2019s been hard on the players, particularly the freshmen. He said the entire program benefited from the break. \u201cWe actually saw it with our whole team,\u201d said Krzyzewski. \u201cEspecially with younger guys, they had been kind of isolated since August 1. \u2026 It did help our team.\u201d Duke\u2019s freshman class, headlined by the now-departed Jalen Johnson, who opted out of the rest of the season this week to focus on his NBA career, includes three players from Virginia. Leesburg guard Jeremy Roach is averaging 9.3 points and 2.7 assists per game. Virginia Beach 7-foot center Mark Williams is at 3.7 and 3.3, but has averaged 7.2 points and 5 rebounds per game the last five outings for the Blue Devils (8-8, 6-6 ACC). Roach has started 11 games and is playing 28.3 minutes per contest, while Williams has made seven starts, including each of the past three, and averages 10.3 minutes per game. \u201cWe have a lot of developing players,\u201d said Krzyzewski. \u201cThey\u2019re not all gonna develop just by the end of this year. We just have to keep working with them, not just for them doing as well as they can this year but to create a foundation for them going into the future for our program.\u201d Coleman, who was heavily recruited by UVa and Virginia Tech, as well, certainly falls in that category. Coleman hasn\u2019t received nearly as much run, though he did play a season-high 13 minutes, scoring four points and grabbing a pair of rebounds, in struggling Duke\u2019s loss to rival North Carolina on Feb. 6. Krzyzewski said he\u2019s seen an improved all-around player in Coleman since returning from this short break home. The Blue Devils had their first games after coming back postponed due to COVID-19 issues at Boston College and Florida State, but in practice, Krzyzewski saw a refreshed Coleman. He had planned to play him heavily on Jan. 12 against Virginia Tech, where Coleman\u2019s father was a standout football player, but Coleman didn\u2019t make that trip due to migraine headaches. Now, Johnson\u2019s departure figures to open the possibility of Williams and Coleman, who competed against each other in high school and were AAU teammates, playing even more minutes down the stretch run of the season, starting with Saturday\u2019s game against first-place Virginia (15-4, 11-2) \u201cSomething Coach said was, just kind of stay ready,\u201d said Coleman. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what I\u2019ve done throughout this whole process.\u201d","756":"The Virginia baseball team wants to end its season in the College World Series, but first, the Cavaliers need to make a smaller step. \u201cOur goal is Omaha,\u201d head coach Brian O\u2019Connor said. \u201cOur goal is that every year. I mean, that\u2019s left unsaid. We\u2019ve got very high expectations, but there isn\u2019t a player on this team that\u2019s played in the NCAA Tournament, to my knowledge. That\u2019s a far cry from being in Omaha and playing for a national championship.\u201d Even with an experienced roster with several MLB-caliber players and a No. 5 preseason ranking from Baseball America, the Cavaliers have plenty to prove in their 2021 season, which begins Friday with a three-game series against UConn. The Huskies enter the spring as the Big East favorite. COVID-19 shortened a promising 2020 season, extending the Cavaliers\u2019 NCAA Tournament drought. They haven\u2019t played in the event since 2017. The program won a national championship in 2015, but saw its streak of 14 consecutive NCAA Tournament appearances snapped in 2018. While O\u2019Connor and company want to make the College World Series, the team first needs to build upon last year\u2019s 14-4 record. \u201cFirst and foremost, this team needs to learn how to win against high-quality opponents on a consistent basis,\u201d O\u2019Connor said. \u201cThen we can talk about if the ball bounces our way where we could potentially end up, but we\u2019re excited because we think we got a pretty good club.\u201d On paper, UVa holds the pieces to make it to Omaha. The starting rotation features two hard-throwing left-handed pitchers in senior Andrew Abbott and sophomore Nate Savino. Senior Griff McGarry and junior Mike Vasil are talented right-handed pitchers expected to be part of the starting rotation. All four players, who went a combined 9-0 in 2020 and struck out 92 batters in 66 innings, are MLB prospects. Virginia plans to start Abbott on Friday, McGarry on Saturday and Vasil on Sunday to open the season. Savino is an option out of the bullpen, and he\u2019s a likely starter for weekday games. In the bullpen, Virginia returns closer Stephen Schoch. The UMBC transfer shined in 2020, his first season with UVa. He led the team with five saves, striking out 24 batters in 16 2\/3 innings and posting a 1.62 ERA. Paul Kosanovich, another graduate student, is expected to contribute in the bullpen alongside Schoch. Seniors Kyle Whitten and Blake Bales add pitching depth in the bullpen as well. Virginia returns each of the 12 players to take at least 15 at-bats last season, while also welcoming a promising freshman class. Among the notable returners are sophomore outfielder Chris Newell and junior infielder Zack Gelof. Newell hit .408 last season and led the team with 20 RBI. Gelof paced the squad with five home runs. Gelof, a professional prospect, believes the Cavaliers can make it to Omaha, but he\u2019s more focused on the daily grind needed to win ACC games. \u201cEveryone knows we want to get there, but you can\u2019t win a national championship in one day,\u201d Gelof said. \u201cYou got to be about the work and be about getting better every day.\u201d The game-by-game grind begins this weekend against a competitive UConn team. Prior to that, UVa competed this fall in practices. With so much returning talent, the practices were intense. O\u2019Connor emphasized playing games against each other since the program missed out on most of its 2020 spring season. Some players found summer-league teams, but most guys missed out on a significant chunk of game action last spring and summer. \u201cThe fall was definitely the most competitive fall I\u2019ve ever been a part of, which is great,\u201d fifth-year catcher Logan Michaels said. \u201cEverybody was getting better from it.\u201d A productive fall and an abundance of talent in the lineup and on the mound make UVa a likely College World Series contender entering the spring. The Cavaliers know they need to focus on the day-do-day challenges. Last season\u2019s promising start was a limited sample size, and they haven\u2019t been to the NCAA Tournament in a few seasons, but in the back of their mind, they have their sights set on a trip to Omaha. \u201cOnce the season ended and once I found out we were gonna get another year of eligibility, I knew right then and there that my plan was to gonna be to come back to UVa and try to win a national championship this year,\u201d Michaels said.","757":"As Virginia\u2019s returning women\u2019s lacrosse players drilled in small groups this fall, its newcomers worked at the other end of the team\u2019s practice field, a COVID-19 safety precaution. Even from a distance, the Cavaliers\u2019 rookies made an impression. \u201cWe could just tell, from the other side of the field, that they had a lot of energy and were excited to be here,\u201d said junior attacker Ashlyn McGovern. \u201cThey didn\u2019t act like freshmen at all.\u201d No. 16 UVa (1-0) added nine freshmen to its roster for this season, five of whom ranked in the top 31 national recruits, according to Inside Lacrosse. Eight played in the season-opening win over East Carolina, with two starting. The rookies combined for five goals, four assists and a save in the 21-6 victory. Midfielder Mackenzie Hoeg started, scored twice and had two assists, and attacker Morgan Schwab also was in the opening lineup and contributed a goal and an assist. Midfielders Maggie Bostain and Aubrey Williams also scored, and midfielder Ellena Schildmeyer added an assist. Freshman goalie Ashley West played the final 5:02 of the blowout, a game UVa led 14-1 at halftime. \u201cOur first-years are as talented a class as we\u2019ve ever had, from top to bottom,\u201d said coach Julie Myers, who is in her 26th season leading the Cavaliers. Their addition figures to be even more significant as UVa attempts to navigate the pandemic. While COVID-19 testing and contact tracing haven\u2019t impacted Myers\u2019 squad yet, it\u2019s a threat that figures to loom all season. Being as deep \u2014 and as versatile \u2014 as possible, figures to be key. \u201cThis is a year that everybody has to be ready,\u201d said Myers. \u201cI know you tell your team that in the preseason and throughout the season all the time. \u2018You never know when your number\u2019s going to be called.\u2019 But this year, in particular, that is really, really true.\u201d But Myers\u2019 freshmen don\u2019t just add bodies, they add skill. That\u2019s especially true in the attack, where the rookies add even more punch to an already potent offense, deep at both the attack and midfield positions. Its ability and versatility was on display in the win over the Pirates. \u201cWe scored from 12 different kids and in a lot of different ways,\u201d said Myers. \u201cWe scored on the fast break. We scored off draw controls. We scored in the crease. We scored off a feed. One-on-ones. I think we attacked from a lot of different areas.\u201d That offense figures to be challenged Friday when it visits No. 14 Richmond (1-0). The Spiders play an unusual defense that mixes both zone and man-to-man concepts. The unit stifled Radford in a 19-10 win on Sunday in Richmond\u2019s opener. The Spiders are the preseason favorite in the Atlantic 10, returning 10 of 12 starters, including its entire attack, from last year\u2019s team, which was 7-0 when NCAA spring sports were canceled due to the spread of COVID-19. Virginia brought back seven starters from last year\u2019s team, which was 5-3 when the season stopped. Included in those eight matches was a 13-12 home overtime loss to Richmond. \u201cThey beat us last year and I think that adds some fuel to our fire,\u201d said McGovern, who led UVa with four goals in the opener.","758":"In building the Virginia men\u2019s lacrosse team back into a national power, Lars Tiffany spent as much time, maybe more, building the program\u2019s culture and the team\u2019s chemistry as he did working on the roster, fundamentals and strategy. With his team scattered away from UVa\u2019s grounds after the 2020 season was cut short due to COVID-19, Tiffany, who took over the Cavaliers in 2016 and led them to the 2019 national championship, had to find a socially distant way to continue his culture building. \u201cI\u2019ve found it very, very difficult,\u201d said Tiffany. Like so many other people across the country, one of the tools he has turned to has been the internet. From scouting work to video reviews to his Thursday cultural meetings, Tiffany has had to do it all online. The results have been mixed. While the team was apart, many of the players enjoyed FaceTiming with teammates but Tiffany says he hasn\u2019t seem the same level of connectedness on this year\u2019s roster. At least, not yet. Better than nothing, but not as good as before, would be a fair assessment, the coach and his players agreed. \u201cWe were all excited to see each other,\u201d said senior attackman Matt Moore. \u201cJust seeing everyone\u2019s faces on Zoom, and of talking about the culture of our team, talking about the upcoming season.\u201d During the pandemic pause, Tiffany\u2019s team read former coach Dom Starsia\u2019s book, \u201cI hope you\u2019ll be very happy,\u201d and UVa sports psychologist Bob Rotella\u2019s book, \u201cHow champions think.\u201d Rotella, a current and a former Navy SEAL and a string of former players, including Steele Stanwick, Bray Malphrus and Matt Ward, joined the team\u2019s Zoom meetings as guest speakers. They tackled the issue of racial inequality in America, watching the documentary \u201cThirteenth,\u201d and viewing lectures and presentations by UVa faculty and staff. Beyond the educational and self-development value of all those exercises, Tiffany firmly believes the discussion and reflection, done as a team, helps build character and chemistry in the program. \u201cContinuously working on that is something we always strive to do,\u201d said senior midfielder Jared Conners. \u201cIt\u2019s a brotherhood and it always has been one. It\u2019s something that hasn\u2019t missed a beat from my freshman year here to all the way to winning a national championship to coming back in my fifth year.\u201d When the Cavaliers returned to grounds in August, Tiffany found them in great cardiovascular shape after their pandemic workouts \u2014 \u201cYou can do a lot of sprinting. You can do a lot of running,\u201d he said \u2014 and only a touch behind strength wise. The team started with group workouts in August and held a training camp at the end of January, before classes began. Tiffany liked what he saw from his team\u2019s mindset. They were excited and happy just to be on the practice fields again. \u201cNow, more than ever, every time we go out to the practice field, it\u2019s a release,\u201d said senior defender John Fox. \u201cIt\u2019s the best part of our day. It\u2019s the first time you\u2019re out of your room.\u201d Still, two games into the season and heading into Saturday\u2019s road game at No. 11 Loyola (1-0), Tiffany knows his program isn\u2019t where it would have been without the virus interrupting its offseason. When the weather improves, Tiffany hopes to conduct some post-practice meetings outdoors, spreading players out on the hill next to the team\u2019s practice field. \u201cWe are not the same tight-knit unit that we\u2019ve been in the last couple of years,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s because we don\u2019t get to spend as much time together. But relative to what I expected, I think we\u2019re in a good place.\u201d The Cavaliers are 2-0 and ranked third in the nation heading to face Loyola, a team it\u2019s played eight times in the past seven years, including last year\u2019s 12-9 home win for UVa. After opening the season against far less familiar foes in Towson and Army, the Cavaliers know what to expect from the Greyhounds. \u201cThey\u2019re so well-coached and they\u2019re such a talented team,\u201d said Tiffany. \u201cThe way they execute their schemes, there\u2019s an exactness and an attention to detail that we don\u2019t see often. It\u2019s so well run and so efficient.\u201d","759":"The Connecticut baseball team drove through a snowstorm Thursday to make it to Charlottesville, and the Virginia baseball team relied on work from roughly two dozen people to clean its field from snow and ice for a chance to host the Huskies on Friday. \u201cBoy, our field crew just did an amazing job to get us on this field,\u201d Virginia coach Brian O\u2019Connor said. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t have known what the weather was like in Charlottesville 24-48 hours ago with the way that field looked.\u201d Clearly, both teams were excited for Friday\u2019s return of college baseball after 11 months away from game action. Each team was amped to compete after last season was canceled due to COVID-19, and it was Virginia (1-0) that outlasted UConn (0-1) in a competitive season opener. Andrew Abbott embraced his role as a starting pitcher, and the offense delivered two early runs to help Virginia open its season with a 2-1 win. O\u2019Connor kept Abbott on a pitch count since it was the season opener, but the senior took advantage of his 93 tosses. He struck out a career-high nine batters, including four in a row across the fourth and fifth innings. Abbott went 5 2\/3 shutout innings, allowing just two hits and yielding one walk. After allowing a few runners in the opening inning, he induced a double play and settled into the action. Abbott said he felt first-inning jitters but quickly calmed down and returned to his usual form. \u201cIt\u2019s been 11 months since you played a college baseball game, so just kind of getting that going and then getting the team on your back is the best feeling ever,\u201d Abbott said. With Abbott dealing, the Cavaliers used early runs to take control of the game. Virginia loaded the bases in the first inning, and redshirt senior catcher Logan Michaels took a pitch to the head to bring in a run. Michaels\u2019 helmet cracked, but he remained in the game after a quick visit from a team trainer. \u201cDefinitely not the ideal way of getting the first RBI of the season,\u201d Michaels said, \u201cbut hey, it got the job done.\u201d The Wisconsin native and former high school hockey player said he\u2019s accustomed to playing through contact. \u201cI played goalie all the way through youth hockey all the way to high school,\u201d Michaels said. \u201cDefinitely used to getting pucks to the head and if I\u2019m stopping the puck and not giving up goals, I mean, I\u2019m happy with it. I\u2019ll take it.\u201d UVa led 1-0 after the opening frame and Michaels\u2019 RBI. The Cavaliers added a run in the third inning on an RBI groundout by senior right fielder Alex Tappen to take a 2-0 lead. Senior left fielder Marc Lebreux, who started the frame with a single, scored on the out. A pitcher\u2019s duel broke out in the following innings. UConn\u2019s Ben Casparius, a North Carolina transfer, performed well for the Huskies. The junior gave up the two runs, but went 5 2\/3 innings and struck out six batters. Neither team scored again until the seventh inning, when the Huskies finally put a run on the board. Freshman first baseman Reggie Crawford put his sweet left-handed swing on a pitch from Paul Kosanovich and mashed it over the right-field fence for a no-doubt home run. Kosanovich, a redshirt senior, struck out the first three batters he faced before allowing the long ball. While UVa didn\u2019t score a run after the third inning, the talented pitching staff delivered. Kosanovich recorded an out after allowing the two-out home run. Aside from the home run, Kosanovich looked dominant in his limited work, showcasing strikeout stuff. Senior Kyle Whitten backed up the effort in the top of the eighth, retiring the Huskies in order. Stephen Schoch, a sixth-year senior who recorded five saves in the shortened 2020 season, slammed the door shut in the ninth inning. The right-handed hurler struck out the final two batters of the game to finish off the win. \u201cIt\u2019s great to be back,\u201d O\u2019Connor said. \u201cI told the team after the game, that\u2019s why they play. It\u2019s why we coach, just the emotion, the excitement in your stomach, playing a great opponent and it comes down to a pitch or a play or at-bat. It\u2019s been 11 months and it\u2019s just so great to be back out on that field competing.\u201d UVa hosts UConn on Saturday at 1 p.m. in the second game of the three-game weekend series. Senior pitcher Griff McGarry is expected to start for the Cavaliers.","760":"University of Virginia officials say the COVID-19 outbreak at the school is the result of many small groups and individual students not following public health guidelines rather than the result of a few super spreader events. Nearly 650 students have tested positive for the virus since Feb. 14 and UVa has averaged 129 new COVID cases a day from Valentine\u2019s Day to Thursday, including a high of 229 new cases on Tuesday. That\u2019s the day that administrators decided they needed to take action to \u2018flatten the curve\u2019 and prohibited all gatherings among students except for in-person classes. They also restricted students living in dormitories to their residences except for trips to class, to get food, go to work or other essential activities. Off-Grounds students were restricted from going onto the campus except for classes or work and the school shuttered recreation facilities and restricted libraries to pick up only. The measures are in effect until at least Feb. 26. Administrators said that if cases don\u2019t show a marked decrease by Feb. 26, the restrictions will be continued. In a virtual town hall held Friday, and in a statement released Thursday afternoon, officials said widespread speculation that two weeks of in-person rush among fraternities and sororities was to blame for the spread is \u201cnot supported by evidence.\u201d Neither does the increase appear to be the result of the U.K. variant of COVID-19, which UVa Health and the Blue Ridge Health District confirmed was discovered on Grounds. \u201cThe COVID positive cases have been distributed across the student population,\u201d said UVa President Jim Ryan. \u201cThey have been on Grounds, off Grounds, among undergraduates and graduate students and in different student groups.\u201d Dr. Mitch Rosner, chair of the UVa Department of Medicine, said during the town hall that about 75% of the cases are in students living off Grounds. He said health department and school investigations and contact tracing show no large cause of the spread but that the virus spread through general \u201clax following of the rules.\u201d No cases of COVID transmission between students and the community at-large have been found, he said. \u201cWe have not seen any students developing serious illness from the virus or needing hospitalization,\u201d Rosner said. Ryan said fraternities were allowed to hold recruitment events in person during February, providing those events met the university\u2019s guidelines of no more than six students together, all wearing masks and socially distanced. In an email to the university community on Thursday, officials said rush events do not appear to be the driving factor in the outbreak. \u201cAt this point, speculation that Greek organizations, or any other single group or part of our community, are solely or primarily responsible for rising cases is not supported by evidence. Transmission and noncompliance are widespread across our community, which is why our public health experts made an unequivocal recommendation to enact the community-wide restrictions,\u201d the message reads. Dean of Students Allen Groves on Friday said the school has sanctioned several individuals and groups, including five fraternities, for public health violations since the school year began in the fall. Ryan said administrators may seem \u201cclueless and na\u00efve\u201d in expecting those regulations to be met, but he said the organizations were being held to the same standards as all UVa student groups. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt rush contributed to this,\u201d Ryan said of the virus outbreak. \u201cThere [is] no doubt there were mistakes we made, but there\u2019s no doubt there were hundreds of other actions that were unrelated to rush that contributed.\u201d The Inter-Fraternity Council at UVa posted a post-rush message on its website noting that its chapters were encouraged to hold virtual events and keep all in-person events within university guidelines. Before the recruitment period began, the organization created an \u201cimmediate adjudication mechanism\u201d to hear reports from students about misconduct on the same day as the violation was reported. \u201cSome reports were preemptive and allowed the governing board to shut down events that would have broken policy before they happened,\u201d the statement reads. \u201cGoing forward, the [council] remains committed to stopping the spread of COVID-19 and complying with all university guidelines, including the recent ban on all in-person gatherings.\u201d UVa is not the only Virginia college enduring a COVID surge. According to the Virginia Department of Health, Virginia Commonwealth University and Bon Secours Memorial School of Nursing in Richmond and the University of Virginia at Wise are reported to have active outbreaks of the virus. Rosner said the surge is likely because students, like many people across the country, are feeling worn down by the continuing pandemic. \u201cNot the least [of the issues] is fatigue around COVID. It\u2019s been going on for a year and we\u2019re all tired of this and want things to go back to normal and so we\u2019re letting our guard down,\u201d Rosner said. Ryan said he hopes the tightened restrictions will flatten the COVID curve without having to add additional restrictions. \u201cWe have to clamp down now. This is what hard looks like,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cThe days ahead will test the character of our community.\u201d Ryan said he believes the restrictions will work and there will be no need for drastic measures such as shutting down school and sending students home. \u201cI don\u2019t believe that\u2019s something we will need to consider. Our serious hope is to never reach that point,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can never say never, but it would be the very last means we use.\u201d","761":"A vaccination clinic that was organized on short notice in an attempt to defrosting Pfizer vaccines in arms quickly went awry Wednesday when the link to sign up for an appointment went to more people than intended. Late Thursday, the Blue Ridge Health District offered more details on what led to long lines and some with appointments being turned away. \u201cWe acknowledge that the clinic did not go as planned,\u201d district officials said in a statement late Thursday. \u201cThis clinic was organized with short notice. There was a supply chain complication that led to Pfizer vaccines defrosting and needing to be administered before the impending snow storm.\u201d The clinic was intended for 400 people 65 and older who live in Albemarle County, certain essential workers, and those who were on Saturday\u2019s waitlist for a vaccine clinic for communities of color. A link to register for appointments through a new system, PrepMod, was sent Tuesday. Those on the Saturday\u2019s waitlist did not receive the PrepMod link because they were already pre-registered by community volunteers. The link to register for appointments was shared with people beyond that group, however, and an overwhelming number of people scheduled appointments. Many of the people originally invited to the clinic weren\u2019t able to schedule an appointment. Others without appointments also showed up to the site. \u201cThis led to more people onsite than the supply of vaccine available,\u201d BRHD said. \u201cThis resulted in extremely long lines, extended wait times and traffic problems. This also meant we had to turn people away who wanted a COVID-19 vaccine.\u201d The state recently switched to PrepMod, a new vaccine registration system, after technical glitches and difficulties with the previous system, VAMS. PrepMod does not allow health departments to create registration links that can\u2019t be shared and reused. State officials have acknowledged the problem and said a fix should be in place by next week. \u201cWe recognize that PrepMod is a helpful tool for scheduling appointments but its link-sharing functionality is highly flawed,\u201d local officials said in the statement. Despite the technical issues, 1,500 people received shots Wednesday over the course of 14 hours and no doses were wasted, according to the statement. So far in the health district, 65,256 doses have been administered and 19,390 people have been fully vaccinated. The pace of vaccinations has slowed recently because of winter weather disruptions. The health district has seen a spike in cases following the increase among University of Virginia students. The seven-day average of new cases had been trending downward after peaking in mid-January. But, on Thursday, the district reported a record new 255 cases. UVa officials said last week that the university has identified the more infectious UK variant of the COVID-19 virus on grounds. The health district\u2019s leadership team discussed Wednesday\u2019s clinic, how to avoid repeating mistakes, and how to improve operations moving forward in a two-hour after action review facilitated by Emily Pelliccia, the City of Charlottesville COVID-19 Incident Management Team Incident Commander. The vaccine is open to people in the 1a and 1b priority groups, which together make up about half of the district\u2019s population. Within 1b, the district is focusing on people 75 and older and three categories of essential workers: police, fire and hazmat; corrections, homeless shelter and child care employees; and teachers and staff at public and private schools. To sign up for the vaccine wait list, go to vaccinate.virginia.gov, the state\u2019s new pre-registration system. Anyone who filled out an interest survey for the local health district had their information transferred to the new system. The state hotline, 877-275-8343 is open daily from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. The district is currently receiving 2,850 doses a week to be used for the first shot. The Virginia Department of Health said Thursday that the recent winter storms could delay vaccine shipments for next week. The health district said on its website that it was rescheduling this weekend\u2019s appointments for second doses to Tuesday because it had not yet received vaccines for this weekend. Dr. Costi Sifri, director of hospital epidemiology at the UVa Medical Center, during a media briefing Friday, said he and others are watching the shipments closely because there\u2019s a large influx of second doses needed across the state. \u201cBut right now I think that we\u2019re in good shape, especially since we\u2019re using the Pfizer vaccine,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that some of the impacts may be more significant with the Moderna vaccine right now statewide.\u201d UVa has administered 44,405 doses as of Wednesday, which includes first and second shots. The medical center is switching computer systems and didn\u2019t have more specific data available during this week\u2019s media briefing. UVa recently opened a vaccine clinic in the former Big Lots at Seminole Square to operate in tandem with the Kmart facility. So far, operations are going well and the site is open once or twice a week for first doses. \u201cAnd in addition to that, in this upcoming week, we\u2019ll then be starting to provide second doses of vaccines on some of those same days,\u201d Sifri said. \u201cOf course I think we have to be looking forward to the day when we have a lot more vaccines so that we could have operations that are occurring much more frequently than that.\u201d","762":"With the evolution of spread offenses, eclipsing 1,000 yards passing and rushing in the same season has become the gold standard for high school football quarterbacks. Central Virginia has several quarterbacks that could reach that milestone this year despite a truncated schedule caused by COVID-19. \u201cThat would be a huge milestone and a great accomplishment,\u201d Monticello senior quarterback Malachi Fields said. \u201cIt\u2019s something I would like to do and will work to get there.\u201d Fields and Nelson County\u2019s George Brown Jr. eclipsed the 1,000-yard passing mark in 2019 and both quarterbacks ran for more than 600 yards for their respective teams. Louisa County\u2019s Landon Wilson was on pace to join the club as well before a broken ankle late in the regular season left him less than 100 yards of the mark. Fluvanna County\u2019s Kobe Edmonds amassed more than 1,300 yards of total offense as a sophomore and is poised to take the next step. \u201cIt\u2019s a great feeling to be back on the field with my team,\u201d Fields said. \u201cThe last few months have been just slow, waiting around for the season, but it\u2019s relieving knowing the season is here.\u201d Fields, a UVa signee, is arguably one of the top athletes in Central Virginia. Whether it\u2019s at quarterback, receiver or kick returner, Fields is a threat to score every time he touches the ball. In 2019, he threw for 1,119 yards and four touchdowns for a rebuilding Mustangs squad. The 6-foot-2, 205-pound signal-caller also ran for 828 yards and 12 touchdowns. Fields spent the extended offseason preparing for a new system under Coach Matt Hicks, working on accuracy and reading defenses at the line of scrimmage. He hopes improved passing paired with his athleticism leads to winning results. \u201cI feel like my best attribute is my ability to run,\u201d Fields said. \u201cIt opens up opportunities that might not be there for other people.\u201d At Nelson County, Brown has been an offensive dynamo. As a junior, he threw for 1,632 yards and 12 touchdowns and added 602 yards and nine scores on the ground as the Governors narrowly missed out on a playoff berth. \u201cI\u2019m just glad to be with the guys and the coaches for my senior year,\u201d Brown said. When he wasn\u2019t playing varsity basketball, Brown spent time working with his receivers and learning new Nelson coach Darrin McKenzie\u2019s offensive scheme . \u201cI\u2019ve mostly been doing individual work with my footwork, running to stay in shape and mostly body weight workouts since we couldn\u2019t go to the gym,\u201d Brown said. \u201cI\u2019ve been working on accuracy and footwork. My goal this season is to have a 50 percent completion percentage, more than 10 total touchdowns and more than 1,500 passing yards.\u201d Brown grew up watching Michael Vick and sees a lot of himself in the former Virginia Tech and Atlanta Falcons quarterback. \u201cHe was so fast and a lot of people slept on his throwing game,\u201d Brown said. \u201cThat\u2019s why I like him. He can beat you on the run and with his arm.\u201d A student of the game, Brown has been impressed by college quarterbacks such as Clemson\u2019s Trevor Lawrence, Ohio State\u2019s Justin Fields and UCLA\u2019s Dorian Thompson-Robinson. The senior said his favorite play in Nelson County\u2019s offense is the run-pass option package. \u201cMy mindset in the huddle is to get everyone focused and then get my guys to know that I have their backs and they have mine,\u201d Brown said. \u201cWhen I get to the line of scrimmage, the goal is to move the ball on every play, then see what coverage the defense is in and then I make my pre-snap reads.\u201d After an outstanding junior campaign, Brown has bigger aspirations this year. \u201cThrowing for a 1,000 yards is a big accomplishment. Luckily I\u2019ve already accomplished that goal,\u201d he said. \u201cNow I\u2019m focusing on extending that goal.\u201d Edmonds is another player that can change a game on just one play. A two-year starter at Fluvanna, Edmonds rushed for 828 yards and 12 touchdowns and threw for 502 yards and five scores last season to lead the Flucos to their second consecutive VHSL Region 3C playoff appearance. \u201cIt feels great to finally be able to get back on the field with my teammates, even though it will be a little bit colder and not the way it has been in the previous years,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is just a blessing.\u201d A point guard on the Fluvanna basketball team, Edmonds brings those same playmaking attributes to the gridiron. \u201cMy mindset when I come into the huddle is to just be positive and make sure all my teammates know what they\u2019re doing,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel my teammates look up to me because I know the majority of the plays and I\u2019m a two-year starter, so if they have a question about anything, they can come up to me at any time. I have a bunch of plays I love to run, especially with some of the new one\u2019s we\u2019re adding this season. What makes me so effective is just being smart and being able to make plays on my feet.\u201d To prepare for the season, the Fluvanna County senior spent a lot of time working out with ADAPT in Charlottesville to help him prepare for the quick turnaround from basketball to football. He also worked out with former Covenant football coach Seth Wilson to improve his mechanics and footwork and spent time each day memorizing the playbook and watching film to focus on the season at hand. \u201cThis offseason, I\u2019ve just been trying to improve each and every day, no matter what,\u201d Edmonds said. \u201cIf it\u2019s getting better at reading defenses or even if it\u2019s just going through my progressions.\u201d With Jefferson District player of the year and all-state honors set as goals, as well as district team title and home playoff game for Fluvanna County, Edmonds has set the bar high for this season. Edmonds said one of his favorite quarterbacks is Drew Brees, who has shook off the doubters and turned in a Hall of Fame career. \u201cNot only did people say he is undersized, but he is a great leader,\u201d Edmonds said, \u201cAnd as a quarterback, your goal is to be a leader.\u201d With the season fast approaching, Edmonds is ready for the challenge of eclipsing 1,000 yards rushing and passing. \u201cI feel it is very difficult, because a lot of people don\u2019t throw or run for 500 yards in a season,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, for me, I feel it would be a great goal to achieve, either 1,000 yards rushing or 1,000 yards passing. It would be great for me because last season I fell 80 yards short of 1,000 yards rushing, so that will be one of my goals this year.\u201d Wilson stormed onto the scene last season, leading Louisa County to a Jefferson District title as a freshman. He threw for 921 yards and seven touchdowns in nine games before breaking his ankle late in the regular season and missing the Lions\u2019 postseason push. The 6-foot-2, 187-pound quarterback has fully recovered from the injury and spent the offseason looking to build off a solid freshman campaign. \u201cWhen I heard the news that the fall season was postponed, I was devastated, especially missing the last three games of the 2019 season due to injury,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cI was excited to get back and show how much I\u2019ve improved. Coach [Will] Patrick and everyone here at Louisa says six games is better than none, so right now, we\u2019re just blessed to be playing with all of the unfortunate circumstances going on.\u201d Wilson and his teammates have spent the past five months champing at the bit, hoping for an opportunity to get back on the field. When the VHSL announced plans for a shortened spring season, the sophomore quarterback was ecstatic \u201cWe\u2019ve been anxiously anticipating this upcoming season, not knowing if we were playing for certain or not,\u201d he said. \u201cFinally putting on helmets and shoulder pads have been a huge relief knowing that we are actually going to play.\u201d The sophomore quarterback made good use of the extra time, working to fine-tune some weaknesses in his game. He said he worked out two to three times a day, including lifting running, footwork and throwing. A strong-armed quarterback, Wilson feels he\u2019s added some new wrinkles to his game. \u201cI think my intelligence and arm strength and accuracy makes me tick as a quarterback. Being able to read the defense and put the ball on the money makes me thrive during the game. This year I think my best attribute is my mobility,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cLast year, I didn\u2019t get to showcase it as much as I am going to this year. Intelligence wise, I\u2019ve also improved. Coach Patrick and I call all the time, making up plays and adding stuff into the playbook. Our playbook has increased drastically as I became more and more comfortable in the pocket.\u201d Like many high school quarterbacks, Wilson has grown fond of the RPO elements that Louisa employs in its offensive scheme. \u201cI can hand it off, throw the screen or take it myself and run it,\u201d he said. \u201cAlmost every time we run it, it\u2019s positive yards. I think being dual-threat makes me effective in our Lion-Wing offense. We could come out in spread one play and single wing the next. With me staying in the whole series, no defense can predict what formation we will be in.\u201d Wilson patterns his game after Tampa Bay quarterback Tom Brady when it comes to decision-making and understanding the offense. Wilson also channels some of Carson Wentz\u2019s risk-taking when it comes to stretching defenses vertically in the passing game. \u201cMy mindset in the huddle is to stay calm and confident, no matter the situation in the game,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cAs the quarterback and leader of my teammates, they\u2019ll react to how I react.\u201d Wilson understands the importance of the 1,000-yard milestone. \u201cI don\u2019t know of anybody in Louisa history that has ran and thrown for 1,000 yards in a single season,\u201d he said. \u201cCoach Patrick and I talked about my goals and he wants me to throw for 2,000 yards and run for 1,000. That is my biggest career milestone. Although it\u2019s condensed season, my goal remains the same.\u201d","763":"Virginia\u2019s pitching left plenty to be desired in Saturday\u2019s loss to UConn, issuing 11 walks and allowing the Huskies to score 10 runs. The Cavaliers\u2019 pitching staff bounced back in a big way Sunday, holding the Huskies to just two unearned runs and issuing only one walk in a series-clinching win. \u201cIt was great to see us come back and pitch like we were capable of,\u201d head coach Brian O\u2019Connor said. Virginia (2-1) beat UConn 4-2 in Sunday\u2019s series finale to open its spring strong. The 2-1 record marks the program\u2019s best three-game start to a season since it began 2017-18 with a 2-1 record. \u201cThat was the first time for me winning the first series,\u201d junior Nic Kent said. \u201c[O\u2019Connor] was saying how that\u2019s an ACC weekend right there. That\u2019s preparing us for the next 12 weeks.\u201d The Cavaliers jumped out to an early lead in the series rubber match, starting the game with three consecutive singles, which helped push a pair of runs across in the opening frame. Kent singled to open the game and stole second to set up a threat. Seniors Marc Lebreux and Devin Ortiz tallied RBIs for the Cavaliers to give them a quick 2-0 lead. UConn tallied its first run in the third inning, scoring on a wild pitch from Mike Vasil. UVa\u2019s starter shut the door on the threat after allowing the run, forcing a pop up to strand a runner on third base. After UConn cut the deficit to 2-1 in the top of the third, UVa answered in the bottom half of the inning. Once again, singles sparked a two-out rally. After a walk, Ortiz and senior Brendan Rivoli recorded singles. Rivoli\u2019s soft shot to left field drove in senior Alex Tappen, who drew the two-out walk. Vasil faced a test in the sixth inning with UVa still leading 3-1. Kyler Fedko singled up the middle with two outs and promptly stole second base. The right-hander recorded a strikeout to end the frame and let out a yell as he headed back to the dugout. Vasil ended the game with six strikeouts, allowing just an unearned run. \u201cKind of one of those moments, close game, that you kind of get fired up for,\u201d Vasil said. \u201cWhen I struck him out, I think it really just sealed the deal for me and kind of put a lid on today.\u201d Emotions were on display again in the bottom of the seventh inning. Zack Gelof fell to the ground after taking a pitch to the arm. After a quick talk with coaches, Gelof remained in the game. He eventually came home to score on a two-out single by redshirt senior catcher Logan Michaels. Once Gelof crossed the plate to give UVa its 4-1 lead, he roared before jogging to the dugout. Senior Blake Bales took the mound for Virginia in the top of the eighth. The right-handed pitcher rallied after Lebreux lost the ball in the sun in left field, allowing UConn double to open the inning. After an inning-ending strikeout stranded a runner at third base, Bales gave a fist pump as he walked toward the Virginia dugout. Closer Stephen Schoch wasn\u2019t at his best in the ninth, but the sixth-year senior mustered enough quality pitches to help UVa earn a 4-2 win over the Huskies. He yielded the team\u2019s one walk and made an error on a play at first base, but used a strikeout to end the game. Schoch threw his glove into left field after the win before chest bumping teammates who ran out from the dugout to meet him on the mound. \u201cI think our energy and effort was really good today,\u201d Kent said. \u201cThat\u2019s what you need on championships Sundays in order to win the series, get those two wins for the weekend.\u201d Virginia is scheduled to host to VMI on Tuesday, although the Keydets missed action this weekend due to COVID-19 issues. As of Sunday evening, Virginia still planned on hosting VMI.","764":"Virginia opened ACC play with seven straight wins and looked like it might go wire-to-wire atop the conference\u2019s basketball standings. Instead, back-to-back road losses to Florida State and Duke have left the Cavaliers facing a question: Just where do they rank in the league? With COVID-19 impacting the league\u2019s already unbalanced schedule, determining the ACC\u2019s best team is as muddled a task as ever. \u201cI think we\u2019re getting a feel for ourselves, but honestly, I don\u2019t know if anybody can say, \u2018I\u2019ve got a great picture. This is who we are,\u2019\u201d said UVa coach Tony Bennett, whose team hosts North Carolina State on Wednesday night. \u201cWe don\u2019t think we\u2019re too good, but we believe when we play right, we can be good.\u201d At 15-5 overall and 11-3 in league play, UVa remains the ACC\u2019s highest rated team in both the NET rankings and KenPom\u2019s team rankings. The two straight losses dropped Virginia to No. 15 in the Associated Press Top 25 poll, the second highest ranked team in the conference behind first-place Florida State. When the NCAA men\u2019s basketball committee released its initial seeding rankings, it had Virginia at No. 9, a three-seed and the highest rated team from the ACC. Since then, it beat North Carolina, got blown out at FSU and lost a one-point game at Duke on Saturday. Senior forwards Sam Hauser and Jay Huff are both having ACC player of the year-caliber seasons. And while the defense isn\u2019t as suffocating as it\u2019s been in recent years, UVa still gives up a league-low 60.3 points per game, the seventh best mark in the nation. So, is Virginia the league\u2019s best team? \u201cHard to say. We\u2019ve played some good basketball,\u201d said Bennett. \u201cEven in the Duke game, I thought we played solid. That was a well-played game, both teams. They made some plays down the stretch.\u201d The Cavaliers\u2019 highest quality wins are a 60-48 victory over North Carolina on Feb. 13, a pair of close wins over Georgia Tech and a blowout of Clemson shortly after the Tigers returned from a COVID-19 pause. Other than an early-season upset by San Francisco, UVa\u2019s losses have all been to quality opponents. Virginia played No. 1 and undefeated Gonzaga on a neutral court in Fort Worth, Texas on Dec. 26, and got pummeled 98-75. In the league, the Cavaliers have lost to Virginia Tech, Florida State and Duke, all on the road. \u201cThose are good teams,\u201d said Bennett. \u201cThis year in this this league, it seems like it\u2019s like most years but even more. It\u2019s pretty balanced.\u201d Adding to the confusion over a pecking order, it\u2019s hard to tell just how good the ACC compared to other leagues in the country. Teams have played far fewer nonconference contests this year, due to the pandemic. Georgia Tech coach Josh Pastner passionately insisted Monday that the conference is still the gold standard. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why there\u2019s not 10 or 11 teams being talked about to be in the NCAA Tournament right now,\u201d said Pastner. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why everyone\u2019s talking about the Big Ten or the Big 12. What about the ACC? Really, 11 teams should in the NCAA Tournament every single year from this league. This league is the best in the country.\u201d That overly glowing assessment aside, the ACC isn\u2019t having the kind of year that would lead people fawning over its elite standing. The league lost the annual ACC\/Big Ten Challenge 7-5, with its top teams struggling in that event. Virginia\u2019s game against Michigan State was canceled due to COVID-19 issues within the Cavaliers\u2019 program. First-place Florida State needed overtime to beat Indiana, 69-67, in Tallahassee, Fla., and third-place Virginia Tech got beaten by 20 at home by Penn State. Fourth-place North Carolina lost 93-80 at Iowa. While the league figures to fall well short of placing the 10 or 11 teams Pastner would like to see in Indianapolis, Florida State, Virginia and Virginia Tech appear safely in the field, and Clemson, Louisville and North Carolina also are included in most bracketology projections. Syracuse, Georgia Tech and Duke still have work to do. With COVID-reduced schedules it\u2019s possible no team in the ACC will win 20 games \u2014 normally an NCAA Tournament benchmark \u2014 this regular-season. For his part, Bennett isn\u2019t spending much time pondering his team\u2019s place in the conference standings as it prepares for the final two weeks of the regular season. After the N.C. State game, UVa hosts Miami and then plays at Louisville to wrap up the regular season. \u201cAll you can control is, you get your team as best as possible,\u201d said Bennett. \u201cIt\u2019s so disjointed with where you play, who you play, when you play them. On the road. Are there teams playing more games, less games, not going? So, it\u2019s so hard to say for anybody.\u201d","765":"UVa\u2019s athletic department shared its latest COVID-19 testing numbers, and men\u2019s basketball coach Tony Bennett spoke during his weekly press conference. A few polls were released Monday as well, with the baseball team climbing up the rankings and the men\u2019s basketball team slipping following two losses last week. In the latest COVID-19 update, UVa\u2019s athletic department shared that it administered 1,554 tests from Feb. 15-21. Of those tests, 20 were positive for COVID-19. The 20 positive test results this week follow 33 positive results in last week\u2019s shared data. This represents an increase in positive cases compared to previous months. From Dec. 14-Jan. 31, the UVa athletics department administered 3,923 tests with 31 positive results. In the last two weeks, UVa has given 3,425 tests to student-athletes and staff with 53 positive tests. Since UVa began testing student-athletes and staff members on July 5, the athletic department has administered 22,865 tests. Of those tests, 199 have been positive. Woldetensae out due to contact tracing Guard Tomas Woldetensae, one of the UVa men\u2019s basketball team\u2019s best bench options, will miss Wednesday\u2019s game against N.C. State, Bennett said Monday on the weekly ACC coaches teleconference. Woldetensae also missed the team\u2019s loss at Duke on Saturday due to COVID-19 contact tracing. Bennett didn\u2019t share a specific date for Woldetensae\u2019s possible return, although he\u2019ll likely be available by the end of the regular season on March 6, assuming the guard tests negative for the virus. \u201cHere he is, a senior, and he has to be out,\u201d Bennett said. \u201cThat\u2019s hard stuff.\u201d UVa\u2019s head coach added that the season is in \u201ccrunch time\u201d with postseason play looming. He says he\u2019s a bit \u201capprehensive\u201d when test results come in, hoping his team remains healthy as the season nears a conclusion. \u201cYou\u2019re just hopeful that nothing\u2019s gonna come down that\u2019ll be tough to absorb at this stage,\u201d Bennett said. Cavaliers fall in AP top 25  After losses to Florida State and Duke, the Virginia men\u2019s basketball team dipped to No. 15 in the latest AP top 25 poll. The Cavaliers were ranked No. 7 last week. Florida State becomes the highest-ranked ACC team in this week\u2019s poll. The Seminoles check in at No. 11. Virginia Tech is one spot behind UVa at No. 16. No other ACC teams are ranked this week, although Clemson and North Carolina both received votes. Despite dipping outside the top 10 of the AP poll, analytics still like the Wahoos. KenPom.com lists Virginia as its No. 10 team this season, and the NET rankings place the Cavaliers at No. 9 despite the recent defeats. UVa up to No. 2 in baseball poll The Virginia baseball team, which won its opening series against UConn over the weekend, climbed to No. 2 in Baseball America\u2019s most recent top 25 poll. The Cavaliers trail only Ole Miss in the rankings. After picking up a pair of wins over UConn, the Cavaliers turn their attention toward VMI. The two teams are scheduled to meet Tuesday at 3 p.m. Following the game with VMI, UVa plays a three-game set at North Carolina that starts Thursday. The Tar Heels opened their season with a three-game sweep of JMU. Cavaliers place second The No. 5 Virginia women\u2019s golf team earned a runner-up finish at the Palmetto Intercollegiate on Monday in Kiawah Island, S.C. The Cavaliers shot 6-over 294 on Monday to take the runner-up trophy with a three-day total of 38-over 902. UVa\u2019s final-round score was the second-lowest of the day. Wake Forest captured the team title at 10-over 874. Senior Beth Lillie was Virginia\u2019s top finisher at 4-over 220 to place fourth.","766":"Officials keep telling students that they must obey COVID safety rules. Too many students ignore them. COVID cases spike. Rinse and repeat. Similar scenarios are playing out at other Virginia universities. Students returned to Grounds for in-person classes in early February. The rules at that time limited gatherings (including in-person classes) to no more than six people. The previous limit had been 10. Did students follow the new rules? Clearly not, given the frightening increase in COVID cases. At the end of two weeks, officials \u2014 alarmed by a rapid 300% spike \u2014 had to implement even stricter safety protocols. They banned all in-person events and gatherings on and off Grounds and closed their recreational centers, citing students\u2019 non-compliance with existing rules. An added concern was the appearance of the U.K. COVID variant. Nearly 650 students have tested positive for the virus since Feb. 14, and UVa averaged 129 new COVID cases a day from Valentine\u2019s Day to Feb. 18, The Daily Progress reported. That included a high of 229 new cases on Feb. 16 alone. Some of the increase in cases initially was feared to have come from fraternity and sorority rush parties. Local residents complained about large gatherings, believed to be connected to rush. Although the enhanced restrictions had been prompted in part by concerns over large-group gatherings such as rush, UVa officials later said the COVID spike was the result of general non-compliance with safety protocols rather than a few super-spreader events. UVa also said there was no evidence that the spike had affected the larger community. The recent rise in cases also was not attributable to the new variant, UVa said. Dr. Mitch Rosner, chair of the UVa Department of Medicine, blamed a general \u201clax following of the rules.\u201d And why did UVa expect anything else? A similar situation arose late last summer when students first were allowed back on Grounds after COVID shut down the campus in spring 2020. Students ignored safety protocols, and the university had to tighten up its restrictions in order to try to circumvent non-compliance and block further spread of the virus. And those problems occurred during warm weather, when large, non-compliant gatherings at least could be held outdoors, mitigating the risk of transmission. Meanwhile, UVa isn\u2019t the only school to be facing such issues. One day after UVa\u2019s latest announcement, Virginia Tech said it would step up testing, and urged students to be more careful. \u201cAs of right now, the numbers at Virginia Tech are not trending in a good way; they are going up,\u201d said spokesperson Mark Owczarski. Christopher Newport University students got a stern warning from administrators earlier in the month as cases rose. And the University of Virginia at Wise, along with Virginia Commonwealth University and Bon Secours Memorial School of Nursing in Richmond, as of last week had active outbreaks of the virus, according to the Virginia Department of Health. What all this shows is that too many students can\u2019t be trusted to self-regulate. But UVa is hoping just the same. \u201cWe have to clamp down now. This is what hard looks like,\u201d President Jim Ryan said. \u201cThe days ahead will test the character of our community.\u201d The new restrictions are in effect until Feb. 26. If things don\u2019t improve by then, UVa will administer another dose of the same medicine, continuing the more restrictive rules. Only as a last resort will it send students home and shift back to holding classes only online. Maybe students will heed the warning this time. But looking at the results from past warnings, here and elsewhere, makes it hard to be hopeful.","767":"Todd DeSorbo\u2019s biggest concern this year isn\u2019t how his swimmers and divers will perform during meets, but rather arriving at each event with his team safe from COVID-19 issues. \u201cI told them beyond that, like if we get there, we\u2019re gonna kill it,\u201d said DeSorbo, Virginia\u2019s swimming and diving head coach. \u201cI\u2019m not worried about that.\u201d His words rang true last week when the UVa women\u2019s swimming and diving team captured the ACC title. It\u2019s UVa\u2019s 17th ACC championship, which is the most of any ACC women\u2019s swimming and diving program. The Cavaliers were impressive over the four-day meet, setting the American and NCAA record in the 200-yard medley relay on the first day. The relay team of senior Caroline Gmelich, junior Alexis Wenger, sophomore Alexa Cuomo and sophomore Kate Douglass broke Stanford\u2019s 2018 record and finished the event in 1:32.93. \u201cIt was kind of a surprise, for me at least, when I found out that we broke the record,\u201d Douglass said. \u201cIt was just super-exciting and kind of unexpected.\u201d The team also set an ACC record in the 800-yard freestyle relay, beating the rest of the ACC field by four seconds. Both of the historic relay marks came on the first day of competition, and the Wahoos maintained their lead over the competition across every day of the event. Once the Cavaliers arrive at meets, DeSorbo tells his team the hardest part is over. Following COVID-19 protocols and avoiding the virus is a major challenge. It\u2019s arguably tougher for the Cavaliers than cruising past their ACC peers. \u201cHe\u2019s definitely drilled that into our heads for the entire year,\u201d senior Paige Madden laughed. \u201cI mean, that being said, we still come to practice every day and work really hard. I guess it kind of ironically takes the pressure off just because we are so focused on getting there.\u201d Arguably the most challenging aspect of competing this season is the uncertainty. The swimmers don\u2019t know if their season will be cut short by COVID-19 issues like it was last year before the NCAA Championships. Even though they\u2019re able to compete, a rise in positive cases can quickly sideline the team or cancel a meet altogether. Madden says the team follows the health protocols diligently. They want to stay healthy, and with the NCAA Championships scheduled to start on March 17, they\u2019re trying to do whatever it takes to compete safely. Madden mentioned that some swimmers are trying to go above and beyond the protocols, even considering having their groceries delivered to avoid possible exposures in the community. \u201cI\u2019m super-excited about it,\u201d Madden said of NCAAs. \u201cI\u2019m trying not to get so excited about it because I don\u2019t want to face the same disappointment we had last year when it was canceled, but I would give anything to swim there this year.\u201d As the Cavaliers train and ready for the big stage in a few weeks, they know nothing is guaranteed. COVID-19 could take away their shot at a national title. On the other hand, they made it through the ACC Championships safely with spectacular results. The goal, like it\u2019s been all season, is to do whatever it takes to get to each meet. When the Cavaliers get there, good things happen. \u201cI\u2019ve never been more proud of a group of athletes than I have been this year,\u201d DeSorbo said. \u201cBalancing everything that they normally go through on top of all the protocols from a COVID perspective, they\u2019ve blown my mind.\u201d","768":"Whether it\u2019s a 433-A, a 941-X or just a simple 1040 or 1099, it\u2019s time to get the forms in order and prepare to prepare tax returns. For those area families who made $57,000 or less, volunteers with the United Way of Greater Charlottesville are ready to help look for tax breaks to minimize payments and maximize refunds. The assistance is part of the organization\u2019s effort to help area residents find financial stability. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at helping people maximize their income because they can do a lot with that tax return or the money they save,\u201d said Ravi Respeto, president and CEO of the local United Way. \u201cOne of our goals is to promote financial stability. The money they can get back, the money they can save by not paying to have their taxes done, is money they can spend on rent or food or pay bills or fix a car.\u201d Called Cville Tax Aid, the program is designed for families and people earning below the Charlottesville area\u2019s estimated median income of $89,900. The program partners with IRS-trained University of Virginia student volunteers through the Madison House Creating Assets, Savings and Hope program, otherwise known as CASH. \u201cMost of the folks we see are on fixed or low income and the idea is to give people a bump in their finances by saving them money, if possible,\u201d said Barbara Hutchinson, vice president of community impact with the United Way. Hutchinson said many taxpayers who can ill afford it hire professional tax preparers and end spending as much on the service as they get in a refund. Others take short-term loans from preparers that are to be paid off when the refunds arrive. \u201cUnfortunately, it can take more than 30 or 60 days to get a refund and, while those short-term loans are interest free, they are only interest free for a limited time,\u201d Respeto said. \u201cThat interest can be very high.\u201d Respeto said current issues with mail delivery and the U.S. Postal Service could make those loans switch to high-interest long before the tax return arrives. \u201cWe want to provide people with an option where they can use their money for what they need,\u201d she said. The United Way will get some back up in the outlying counties, including Fluvanna, Louisa and Nelson counties. The University of Virginia Community Credit Union will join the United Way in providing walk-in offices across the region. The pandemic has forced a lot of changes to taxes this year and the IRS is well aware of it. The service has its eye on people who took to part-time jobs to meet their ends and wants to remind them that taxes are due on that money. \u201cWhether it\u2019s a side business or a primary source of income, the bottom line is taxpayers must report gig economy income on their tax return,\u201d officials said in a statement. The officials said freelancers, independent contractors, those using online platforms to connect with customers, including renting their homes or spare bedrooms or providing delivery services, must pay taxes on that income. Besides the regular income taxes, those earning side money will need to file for and pay the federal self-employment contribution tax and additional Medicare and Social Security taxes. Independent contractors may be able to deduct business expenses, but should double-check tax rules on using their car or setting up a home office, which are not always tax deductible. Rental income is taxable and special rules may apply to rental property also used as a residence during the tax year. Virginia tax officials are encouraging tax filers to file soon, although possible changes tax law by the state legislature could result in needing to file amended tax returns. \u201cThis year, we strongly encourage you to file electronically as well and request a refund, if you have one coming, via direct deposit,\u201d said Tax Commissioner Craig M. Burns. \u201cThat\u2019s especially important now because, due to COVID-19 workplace protocols, it could take longer than what\u2019s typical to process a paper return.\u201d Generally, it takes up to four weeks to process an electronically-filed return and up to eight weeks to process a paper return, state officials said. COVID has had an impact on the United Way\u2019s program as well. In any normal year, more than 180 UVa students, trained in tax preparation, meet area clients face-to-face. This year there were 263 volunteers trained and ready to return tax filings. But 2020 was not a normal year and 2021 is shaping up to be just as different. A new, virtual system of tax preparation had to be devised, which delayed opening of the program. To help out, Hantzmon Wiebel LLP, a Charlottesville-based tax, accounting and advisory firm, prepared more than 100 tax returns during February. \u201cWe had to redesign our operations in the face of COVID-19 and that took us a while to create a new system,\u201d Respeto said. \u201cWe have people make appointments and come to our [407 E. Water St.] intake site with all of their paperwork. The documents are provided to a volunteer who calls them and goes over their taxes with them.\u201d The appointment number is (434) 459-0504. The returns may be filed electronically, but the IRS does require the taxpayer to sign a form as well. The tax aid program also helps guide clients through the confusing profusion of tax laws and requirements. The returns are also needed to receive help from some government assistance programs. There are also special forms to be filled out for those who purchase health insurance through the Affordable Care Act and acknowledgements of COVID release checks that the preparers are trained to complete. \u201cWe do not want families that are suffering financially to resort to the use of refund anticipation loans or paid preparation that significantly reduces their much-needed refund,\u201d Respeto said. \u201cWe want them to be able to use their money on their needs.\u201d","769":"The Virginia baseball team spent 11 months away from game competition due to COVID-19. The team received just four nonconference games this spring before it jumps into ACC play. \u201cIt\u2019s weird,\u201d Virginia head coach Brian O\u2019Connor said. \u201cThe fact that you\u2019re only playing four games before now, a 12-weekend schedule in our league. I don\u2019t know if anybody in our league is gonna say they\u2019re ready because what we\u2019re typically used to.\u201d UVa is accustomed to playing about 13 nonconference games before its ACC opener. The Cavaliers usually face decent nonconference competition in addition to a few less powerful foes. Those games allow Virginia to work its pitchers up to a full workload while also giving the team a chance to develop chemistry and find an on-field rhythm. That\u2019s not much of an option this season for No. 12 UVa (3-1), which opens ACC play Thursday at North Carolina (4-0). For some of the youngsters, the ACC road series against the Tar Heels is a first. The series will be the first ACC road trip of Chris Newell\u2019s career. The sophomore played a home ACC series last season, but he\u2019s yet to play a conference road game while at Virginia. The same is true for UVa\u2019s other underclassmen, who don\u2019t have much ACC experience, if any. Newell called last season\u2019s experience \u201csour.\u201d He missed the opportunity to have a full freshman season, only playing 18 games. He hit over .400 in the shortened 2020 season, but only played three games against ACC foes. The left-handed hitter is heating up this year after a slow start. The outfielder hit a home run and a double in Tuesday\u2019s win over VMI after recording just one hit in the opening weekend against UConn. He\u2019s ready to test his game against ACC peers. \u201cI can speak for all of us, honestly, that we\u2019re really fired up for this weekend,\u201d Newell said. \u201cGetting the opportunity to go down to Chapel Hill and open up against UNC. I know I\u2019m personally looking forward to it and the rest of us definitely are fired up to get down there and start on a hot note.\u201d North Carolina will challenge the Cavaliers. The Tar Heels swept James Madison to open the season before beating Elon 4-1 on Tuesday. UNC is allowing an average of just two runs per game, leaning on its pitching to secure wins. Redshirt sophomore pitcher Austin Love didn\u2019t allow a hit across six shutout innings in UNC\u2019s season opener. He struck out nine batters. \u201cWe talk all the time about pitching and defense and when he throws the ball like he did today, we\u2019re going to have a chance to win every game,\u201d UNC head coach Scott Forbes said after the win. The Tar Heels were picked to finish fifth in the seven-team ACC Coastal Division. UVa came in second in the preseason picks by ACC coaches. While Virginia is expected to be the better team this season, UNC pitches well and is a competitive squad. The Tar Heels are off to a strong start, and they\u2019re certainly capable of beating Virginia, especially this early in the season. UVa counters UNC\u2019s stellar early season pitching with a quality rotation of its own. Senior Andrew Abbott was dominant in his first start of the season, and senior Griff McGarry showed promise in his first start. Mike Vasil, a junior, controlled the game in his win over UConn to clinch a series victory. The three weekend starters allowed two earned runs in 15 2\/3 innings against UConn, striking out 24 batters. The Cavaliers also have an impressive collection of hitters in their lineup. They\u2019re seeking consistency as the season progresses, but the group scored nine runs in a Saturday game against UConn and 14 runs Tuesday in the win over VMI. It\u2019s early in the season, and Virginia still has plenty of room to grow and improve. The schedule makes it so that growth will mostly occur during conference games this spring. Ready or not, ACC play is here. \u201cThat\u2019s big-time baseball right there,\u201d freshman pitcher Luke Schauer said. \u201cThat\u2019s what I think everybody dreams of, so it\u2019s really exciting. I think we\u2019re gonna be really excited as a team together to do it, so we\u2019ll see how it goes.\u201d","770":"Virginia wasn\u2019t panicking after back-to-back road losses at Florida State and Duke. Maybe it\u2019s time to start. Floundering at both ends of the floor, the No. 15 Cavaliers fell 68-61 to North Carolina State on Wednesday at John Paul Jones Arena, losing their third straight game and falling at home for the first time this college basketball season. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to figure some things out,\u201d said senior forward Jay Huff. \u201cBut it\u2019s not the end of the world.\u201d Freshman guard Cam Hayes scored 16 points and senior forward D.J. Funderburk added 14 for the Wolfpack (11-9, 7-8 ACC), which won its third straight. Senior forward Sam Hauser led Virginia with 21 points. Huff added 19 points and 11 rebounds, and junior guard Kihei Clark finished with 11 points and seven assists. Most of that production came during a desperate second half. Virginia (15-6, 11-4) went to Raleigh on Feb. 3 and beat the Wolfpack 64-57. But that was three weeks ago and this is a very different looking UVa team now, one struggling to defend the paint defensively, and enduring long scoring droughts offensively. \u201cWe need a lot of things with this team to be on and right,\u201d said Virginia coach Tony Bennett. \u201cAnd it\u2019s a hard way to go to be that sharp mentally and that good physically to beat teams that are playing well. But that\u2019s just this team this year. When it\u2019s a little off or it\u2019s not right, then you can lose.\u201d This is just the third three-game slide for UVa in the past five seasons. The Cavaliers, who are off this weekend and host Miami on Monday night, haven\u2019t lost four in a row since February, 2017. \u201cLosing three games is never fun,\u201d said Hauser. \u201cYou can\u2019t win em all, but you can learn from all the losses.\u201d With heightened COVID-19 precautions on grounds, UVa had no fans in attendance Wednesday, not even the small contingent of family and friends it had been allowing. A near-empty arena witnessed a largely empty performance. The Cavaliers came out cold, and needed 3:40 to score their first points, on an inside basket by Huff. The Wolfpack jumped out to a 17-4 lead with 11:08 left in the half. Virginia missed 11 of its first 13 shots and its first eight attempts from 3-point range. It trailed by as many as 14 \u2014 24-10 with 6:05 to go before halftime \u2014 before fighting back into the game. At one point, a personal 6-0 run by Huff cut the Wolfpack edge to 25-21, and the Cavaliers went to the locker room down by a manageable count of 29-23. \u201cI thought the start of the game once again was not where it needed to be,\u201d said Bennett. \u201cWe dug ourselves in a hole.\u201d Still, it was a flawed half for the Hoos on both ends of the floor. Offensively, though it cut down on turnovers, committing only three, Virginia shot 10-for-27 from the floor and 1-for-9 from 3-point range. They drew just two fouls in the first 20 minutes of play. Defensively, N.C. State scored 18 of its 29 points in the paint and shot 12-for-25 before the break. The Cavaliers turned things around out of the gates in the second half. Hauser hit back-to-back 3-pointers to tie the game 29-29 and N.C. State\u2019s first three possessions were fruitless. State regained command during a 12-2 run highlighted by a corner 3-pointer by Braxton Beverly. That came during another cold-spell for the UVa offense in which it missed eight of nine shots and allowed the Wolfpack to go up 45-37. Virginia stayed close the rest of the way, led by Hauser and Huff, but never really threatened to take the lead. It trailed by four, 65-61, with 15 seconds left when Hauser\u2019s long 3 bounced around the rim but rolled off. It got 40 of its 61 points from its two redshirt senior forwards. The strange disappearance of Trey Murphy III continued. Despite UVa playing its second straight game without senior guard Tomas Woldetensae, who is out due to COVID-19 contact tracing, the Rice transfer was a non-factor. After taking just two shots in Saturday\u2019s loss at Duke, Murphy III was 1-for-3 in the first half and didn\u2019t start the second, when UVa turned to a big lineup with sophomore forward Francisco Caffaro instead. Murphy III finished 1-for-5, including an 0-for-4 showing from beyond the 3-point arc, before fouling out with 8.6 seconds to go. Defensively, UVa allowed 30 points in the paint.","771":"UVa recently had to clamp down (again) on rules for social gatherings, and it closed or restricted access to some campus buildings. It also is bringing violation cases against five fraternities and several individual students. Although UVa officials said last week there was no evidence that contagion had communicated itself to the community at large, the fear of exactly that sort of spread of infection worries many local residents. For exactly these sorts of reasons, the behavior of young people is part of the debate on how to apportion the scarce resource of vaccines. Some people argue that because they are less likely to follow safety protocols and more likely therefore to carry the virus to others, young people should be vaccinated first; that would control COVID transmissions at the source of the spreaders. Others argue that since older people are most vulnerable to death and severe illness, they should be vaccinated first; that would control COVID among the most likely victims. Most world governments are using a hybrid model in which older people are prioritized for vaccines alongside others in high-risk groups or important service occupations. However, preliminary results from a new study from UVa\u2019s Biocomplexity Institute suggest that vaccinating possible super-spreaders is the most efficient and effective way to control COVID. These super-spreaders are \u201cthose individuals with the greatest number social contacts and \u2018social proximity time\u2019 with others,\u201d the university reports. If immunizations were focused there, some 51,000 to 62,000 lives could be saved in the US alone. That approach also could prevent three to six million infections, resulting in 180,000 to 306,000 fewer hospitalizations. Just the savings to hospitals would be significant, not to mention that it would open up beds for people in need of other sorts of care. As governments struggle to apportion precious vaccines, such a proposal will come under fire from critics, for two reasons. One is that it seems patently unfair to \u201creward\u201d the very people who, as a general group, are flouting safety rules. If they\u2019re too selfish to safeguard others as well as themselves, why should they be prioritized for vaccines when \u201cmore worthy\u201d people are denied that protection? The other derives from different definitions of protection and the ideal way to achieve it. The argument already has been made that older people need the highest level of protection \u2014 early vaccination \u2014 because they are most likely to die or suffer serious symptoms from contracting COVID. The other groups in the early vaccination category include health-care workers, whose health and safety is vital to the nation\u2019s ability to fight COVID as well as other diseases. It runs the gamut all the way to inmates in jails and prisons \u2014 on the theory that they are confined, not by choice, in crowded facilities that are breeding grounds for contagion: The state has mandated that they be imprisoned; the state is responsible for their health. Parsing the morality of such decisions is an impossible challenge. All the various arguments make sense \u2014 depending on which goals and values are used as filters. The Biocomplexity Institute uses sheer numbers as its filter. The model predicts a greater number of lives saved, and does not concern itself with \u201cfairness\u201d or the relative value of some lives over others. Vaccine manufacturers have promised to step up production to meet the vast demand for immunization. But as yet we are a world coping with the moral and practical problems of how to apportion a scarce resource \u2014 and with the resulting conflicts between winners and losers.

The first phase to raise the minimum pay rate is part of schools Superintendent Matt Haas\u2019 $209 million funding request, which he presented to the School Board last week. The board held a second budget work session Thursday to hear more specifics about the draft spending plan. The division is now proposing a 5% raise for teachers in response to moves at the state level and the Charlottesville School Board\u2019s adopted funding request. That raise would cost an additional $1.9 million. Haas included a 3% raise for teachers in his funding request that would cost $2.7 million. The raise for classified employees would stay at 2%. Compensation changes, including raising the minimum wage, are the costliest pieces of new funding in the request, which includes $12 million in new spending, as well as $4.1 million in one-time expenses. Currently, 448 of the division\u2019s 2,514 employees make less than $15 an hour. For full-time employees, the minimum starting wage is $10.20 and is proposed to be bumped to $15. Raising the minimum pay rate for full-timers to $15 an hour also would mean hiking wages throughout the pay scale, increasing the cost of the proposal. Overall, division staff said Thursday that moving full-time employees to at least $15 an hour and adjusting the pay scale would cost $2.8 million, which is $1.1 million less than what was included in the draft funding request. That\u2019s because of changes to how division staffers are planning to adjust the pay scale. They are continuing to tweak that strategy. School Board member Judy Le said she wanted to see more specifics about how the division could bring the part-time employees to a minimum of $15 an hour, as well. Division staff said that doing so would mean a bigger pay bump for full-time employees. \u201cWe agree with you,\u201d said Rosalyn Schmitt, the division\u2019s chief operating officer. \u201cIt\u2019s important. We want to as soon as we are financially able to bring everybody up to $15.\u201d Albemarle County is continuing to work on plans for expanding in-person classes next month when the division moves to the fourth stage of its reopening plan. That includes developing training materials for staff and students on how to follow and implement COVID mitigation measures such as wearing masks and social distancing. Additionally, the division is developing a tool to assess the implementation of those measures during school walk-throughs. \u201cSo we\u2019ll have some clear data about how well we\u2019re doing there,\u201d said Patrick McLaughlin, the division\u2019s chief of strategic planning. How the division will ensure compliance with those measures has been a concern of teachers and parents since the division first opened up in-person classes to lower-level elementary students in November. The School Board also reviewed the latest COVID-19 case numbers, which had spiked recently following the return of University of Virginia students. UVa has reported more cases among students this year than during the fall semester. University officials have blamed the surge on students not following the COVID-19 precautions and subsequently prohibited all gatherings among students except for in-person classes and at dining halls. Those restrictions, announced Feb. 16, are in place until Friday, when they\u2019ll be reevaluated. Cases in Charlottesville and Albemarle had been trending down following the holiday surge but the trend reversed recently. The seven-day average of new cases for Charlottesville peaked at 64 on Feb. 21. In Albemarle, the seven-day average peaked at 63 on Wednesday. Dr. Carlos Armengol with Pediatric Associates of Charlottesville, said most of those cases are related to UVa. He\u2019s been keeping track of the health district\u2019s numbers since July. Based on his analysis, Armengol said 90% of the new cases Charlottesville and Albemarle in recent weeks are UVa students. \u201cIn the last couple of days, the numbers have started to trend down,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope that continues. We\u2019ll know roughly in a few days if it is going to continue as such.\u201d Armengol added that the number of COVID cases at Pediatric Associates has dropped significantly since mid-January. \u201cSo that\u2019s been encouraging,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that\u2019s a reflection on what\u2019s really going on in the community.\u201d School Board member David Oberg said he appreciated the analysis but was concerned that the UVa cases would affect the larger community. \u201cThe reality is, whether they\u2019re counted in Charlottesville or counted in Albemarle, they are in our community, and if you go down to Barracks Road or go down to The Corner, you\u2019re going to interact with those same students,\u201d Oberg said. \u201cI accept the fact that there\u2019s a certain distancing between the campus and the rest of the community but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s as solid a wall as it seems by taking those numbers out.\u201d","774":"After essentially locking down Grounds for 10 days, the University of Virginia will allow students to gather in groups of six or less and will relax other pandemic restrictions. Effective immediately, the decision announced Friday continues to limit indoor dining to groups of two. Other university facilities, such as recreation centers and libraries, will reopen and students can resume normal activity. Officials encouraged students to stick to a specific pod, or bubble, of people and to continue to follow the range of mitigation measures. \u201cThe only thing preventing another spike in cases and a return to more restrictive measures is our commitment, as a community and as individuals, to remain vigilant and faithfully follow the public health measures we have in place,\u201d UVa officials wrote in the announcement. They added that though the changes are good news, they are not a sign that the university is out of the woods. The announcement came as the UVa Medical Center said it would ease its current visitation policy and allow visitors back in on a limited basis. Those changes will go into effect Tuesday. Amid the holiday surge of cases, the Medical Center banned visitors with limited exceptions, which included for patients at the end of their life. During a media briefing Friday, Reid Adams, chief medical officer for UVa, said the Medical Center looked at a variety of data points in making its decision. Those included testing prevalence, trends in COVID-19 hospitalizations and the overall number of COVID-19 patients at the hospital. \u201cWe try to take all of those things into account with the idea that as conditions improve, we\u2019re able to then increase the amount and type of visitations that we can bring into the institution because the risk of exposure goes down,\u201d he said. As of Wednesday, UVa has 43 COVID-19 patients and the seven-day average of new daily hospitalization is down to five from its high of 9.5 in early January. Additional visitors will be allowed to the Medical Center\u2019s inpatient units, emergency department and procedural areas. All visitors will be screened for COVID-19 symptoms and must not have any to enter. Those in the inpatient units can have two designated visitors, with only one allowed at a time. Those in outpatient areas can have one visitor. As with the current policy, there are some exceptions, such as for patients at the end of their lives, who can have two visitors 24 hours a day, seven days a week. For more information, go to uvahealth.com\/services\/covid19-visiting-restrictions. After announcing the stricter measures earlier this month, UVa President Jim Ryan and other officials said during a community town hall that the February spike was the result of many students not following the COVID-19 guidelines. Contact tracing has shown that indoor dining is a higher-risk activity, hence the continued restriction. \u201cThis virus exploits small mistakes,\u201d UVa officials wrote Friday. \u201cMany of the cases that led to the spike started with minor lapses like two or three people removing their masks to eat together in a dorm room or off-Grounds residence.\u201d Since the new restrictions went into effect, the number of daily new cases and the positivity rate have declined. \u201cOn the first full day of our new public health measures, we registered 229 new cases, our highest total of the year by far,\u201d UVa officials wrote. \u201cYesterday, we saw just 26 new cases.\u201d UVa students made up 53% of the 2,239 new cases reported this month in the Blue Ridge Health District. That\u2019s the second-highest monthly total since the pandemic began last March. The record was set last month, when 3,237 new cases were reported. Similar to January, hospitalizations continued to rise quickly with 75 new people hospitalized in the health district this month, bringing the total to 510. As the Virginia Department of Health started to work through a backlog of 2021 death certificates related to the holiday surge in cases, the death toll locally has started to come into focus. Thirty-two new COVID-related deaths have been reported this month, the highest of any month during the pandemic. Since last March, 142 people have died in the health district, including 54 in Albemarle County and 41 in Charlottesville. The university will continue to limit volunteer activity \u201cout of a concern for spreading the virus into the community.\u201d However, students who are emergency medical technicians or firefighters and have been vaccinated can resume those volunteer activities. All other health and safety guidelines, including restrictions on visitors and travel, remain in effect, according to the announcement.","775":"The Virginia men\u2019s basketball program won\u2019t be in action this weekend. The Cavaliers\u2019 next scheduled game comes Monday, when it hosts Miami. Even with Tony Bennett\u2019s team out of action, news trickled in late this week about former Virginia men\u2019s basketball players and ACC Tournament COVID-19 rules and regulations. Elsewhere in the Virginia sports world, the baseball team\u2019s Friday game against North Carolina was postponed due to rain. The series was originally moved up due to weather concerns over the weekend, which is why the teams played the series opener Thursday, but the chance of precipitation on Saturday and Sunday seems lower than previously expected. It\u2019ll likely be cloudy, but the teams hope they can compete this weekend. The squads are now set to play Saturday at 2 p.m. and Sunday at 1 p.m. Here\u2019s a quick look at recent UVa basketball news. Jerome recalled by Thunder Early this month, the Oklahoma City Thunder assigned Ty Jerome to the Oklahoma City Blue, the organization\u2019s G League affiliate. The former UVa star missed the start of the season with a left ankle sprain, and the Thunder wanted to give him a chance to work up to speed in the G League. After three productive weeks, Jerome was recalled by the Thunder on Thursday. He\u2019ll rejoin the NBA squad after playing well for the Blue. He played in nine games for the Blue, starting in seven of those contests. He averaged 12.1 points and 3.2 assists across 24 minutes per game. Jerome scored at least 14 points in his five most recent G League games. He was one of the Blue\u2019s top performers and was frequently asked to make plays down the stretch of tight games. It\u2019s unclear how much time Jerome might receive at the NBA level, but he\u2019s worked his way back from his ankle injury and is least ready to be an option off the bench for the Thunder. ACC tournaments to allow fans The state of North Carolina recently adjusted its limitations on indoor gatherings. That\u2019s good news for ACC basketball fans. The conference\u2019s men\u2019s and women\u2019s basketball tournaments will allow limited fan attendance in addition to the attendance of family members of players and coaches. The details of the fan attendance have yet to be announced by the league, but they expect more clarity in coming days. The women\u2019s tournament begins on March 3, while the men start play on March 9. \u201cOur conference has terrific partners in the Greensboro Coliseum, who have worked to ensure we are able to safely include fans in the arena while maintaining our top priority, which is the health and safety of our student-athletes, coaches, administrators and support staff,\u201d ACC commissioner Jim Phillips said in a statement. Contact tracing devices ACC basketball teams have used KINEXON contact tracing devices all season. The devices track how long people are within a certain proximity to one another, which gives the ACC programs an idea of which players need to self-quarantine should one of their teammates or a staff member test positive for COVID-19. Typically, the devices are used when student-athletes, coaches and support staff are in team facilities. The ACC announced Friday that all men\u2019s and women\u2019s basketball teams that attend the conference tournaments will use the devices during the event. The goal is to ensure proper contact tracing protocols as each tournament progresses. \u201cEffective contact tracing is one of the best tools we have to prevent transmission,\u201d Christina Mack, an epidemiologist who works at UNC, said in a statement. \u201cThe KINEXON device provides a key starting point to understand interactions between individuals, and assess risk of transmission.\u201d","776":"In his five years with the Virginia men\u2019s basketball program, Jay Huff has seen just about everything a college basketball player could see. He was on the UVa team that was stunned by UMBC in 2018, the first No. 1 seed to lose to a 16. He cut down the nets the next year in Minneapolis, a member of the Cavaliers\u2019 first national championship team. And he packed his bags and headed home from Greensboro last March, when the season was abruptly called off due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Yes, Huff has seen it all during his time at Virginia. Monday night, he\u2019s looking forward to seeing his loved ones in the stands at John Paul Jones Arena one final time. \u201cI want my wife there,\u201d said Huff. \u201cI want my family there.\u201d No. 15 UVa (15-6, 11-4 ACC) played its last game \u2014 a loss to North Carolina State \u2014 with no fans in the stands due to the University\u2019s heightened COVID-19 restrictions, put in place after a surge of cases of the virus on Grounds. On Sunday, a school spokesman confirmed UVa was returning to its previous protocols, which have allowed friends and family of players and staff to attend home games. That\u2019s an important development for Huff and the programs other seniors \u2014 Sam Hauser, Tomas Woldetensae and walk-on Austin Katstra \u2014 who are likely playing their final games at John Paul Jones Arena on Monday against Miami (7-15, 3-14). After Wednesday\u2019s home loss to North Carolina State, the Cavaliers\u2019 third in a row, Huff acknowledged that the fatigue attacking the team isn\u2019t solely the normal physical exhaustion of a college basketball season. The mental and emotional toll of playing a college basketball season through the COVID-19 pandemic may finally have caught up Virginia. \u201cI mean we\u2019re all tired,\u201d said Huff said after the 68-61 loss to the Wolfpack. \u201cObviously, it\u2019s all frustrating, especially with the rising numbers in the UVa community. We can\u2019t have fans here. But obviously that\u2019s not an excuse, because we play in empty arenas all the time and we play in practice all the time when it\u2019s empty. No excuse by any means. Yeah, guys are tired, but so is everybody else.\u201d Virginia won its first seven ACC games this season, came out on top of 11 of 12 of its first league contests and was a fixture atop the conference standings. It reached as high as No. 7 in the Associated Press Top 25 poll just two weeks ago. Then came the fade. The second-place Cavaliers have lost their past three games, a blowout at Florida State, a one-point heartbreaker at Duke and Wednesday\u2019s home loss to North Carolina State. Consistency has been difficult to achieve for teams across the college basketball landscape this season. By Tony Bennett\u2019s own admission, this year\u2019s installment of UVa basketball hasn\u2019t been good enough to win games when its execution isn\u2019t top-notch. \u201cIt\u2019s a hard way to go to kind of be that sharp mentally and that good physically, to beat teams that are playing well,\u201d said Bennett. \u201cBut that\u2019s just this team, this year. When it\u2019s a little off or it\u2019s not right, you can lose if you\u2019re not there.\u201d So, has all the added stress of COVID-19 protocols, isolating from friends and family, taking remote courses and playing in front of mostly-empty arenas finally caught up with the Cavaliers? \u201cThat\u2019s a fair question,\u201d said Bennett. \u201cIf it was just us, I\u2019d say sure. It\u2019s everyone. Yeah, our guys, everybody\u2019s been here since July. That\u2019s real. But everyone\u2019s in the same boat. It is what it is as they say. Everybody\u2019s going through that same thing.\u201d The question now is, can Bennett and his players bring that boat in smoothly to shore. After the Miami game, UVa ends the regular season Saturday at Louisville. If it wins one of those two, it will finish no lower than sixth going into the upcoming ACC Tournament in Greensboro, N.C. Win both and the Cavaliers will be assured of at least the No. 2 seed and a double-bye \u2014 given to the top four teams \u2014 into the quarterfinals. For their part, Bennett\u2019s players have taken on their coach\u2019s approach to the issue of mental exhaustion. It\u2019s real. It\u2019s unavoidable. And it must be dealt with if Virginia is going to find success in the postseason. \u201cI think that\u2019s just the nature of it for every team right now,\u201d said Hauser. \u201cI think that\u2019s just something we have to go through. You have to not let that affect you as much as you can and I think our team has done a good job of it thus far. We just have to continue with it. There\u2019s about one month left in the season and every game down the stretch here is really crucial for us.\u201d","777":"It was a stressful afternoon for Louisa Moser. George Mason\u2019s senior goalkeeper spent much of Sunday\u2019s game trying to turn away chances by the Virginia women\u2019s soccer team, which was relentless offensively in its first spring game of the season. The Cavaliers controlled possession, but had some trouble turning possession into goals thanks in part to Moser. They finally broke through with a goal in the 76th minute off the foot of freshman Lia Godfrey. Junior Rebecca Jarrett added another goal in the final 10 minutes to help UVa beat George Mason 2-0. The victory moved Virginia to 9-3-1 overall dating back to the start of the fall season. \u201cIt\u2019s early,\u201d Virginia head coach Steve Swanson said. \u201cFelt like a year since we\u2019ve been back out here. It was a difficult challenge for us because obviously they put a lot of numbers behind the ball.\u201d While Moser was busy Sunday, she performed well, especially in the first 75 minutes. She was able to save a few quality chances, and her defense played well in front of her to thwart potential scoring threats. Ultimately, Godfrey was able to score on a set piece from the top of the box after a George Mason foul. Godfrey beat Moser to the goalkeeper\u2019s left, scoring on the right half of the goal. After pressuring George Mason all game, Virginia\u2019s players celebrated excitedly about finally breaking through on the scoreboard. While Moser\u2019s Sunday was stressful, Virginia senior goalkepper Laurel Ivory enjoyed a relaxing afternoon. She directed traffic from UVa\u2019s side of the field, but was rarely put into important positions. George Mason tallied just one shot the entire game, and it was blocked before reaching Ivory. Virginia played 20 different players Sunday, giving its bench playing time in the first official spring action of the season. \u201cIt\u2019s a good start,\u201d Swanson said. \u201cWe got a good win, so that was important, and we got a lot of players who played some minutes today which was good, but we just gotta keep progressing.\u201d Swanson wants better play in future games, even with the positive result. Jarrett delivered with crisp execution on her late insurance goal a few minutes after Godfrey\u2019s breakthrough. The athletic forward created space on the left side of the box before burying the ball in the right side of the net. As the Cavaliers attacked Sunday, the Patriots seemed content to sit back and play defense. They did well to swarm players with the ball. At other times, George Mason players sank back in the middle of the field, giving UVa plenty of open space outside the box. When the Wahoos came close to the box, they were met by aggressive defenders. The result was a game controlled by Virginia, but the teams went into the locker room at halftime tied at 0. After bending for much of the game, George Mason\u2019s defense broke in the final 15 minutes. Virginia\u2019s spring schedule continues Saturday when it plays at VCU. Swanson says the team has been fighting the weather and COVID issues in recent weeks to find time to train as a full team, which led to some inconsistency against the Patriots. Even with some inconsistency, Virginia still used its talent and athleticism to overwhelm George Mason. \u201cHopefully we can get back to the level that we were playing at, at the end of the fall because that was quite good,\u201d Swanson said. \u201cThat\u2019s the goal, but I think there are still a lot of kinks to work out.\u201d","778":"The latest numbers represent a decrease in positives compared to previous weeks. The athletic department gave out 1,871 COVID-19 tests from Feb. 8-14, with 33 positive test results. From Feb. 15-21, 1,554 tests were administered to student-athletes and staff. Of those, 20 were returned positive. While fewer tests were administered this week compared to the previous weekly periods, the four positive results show a decrease in the percentage of tests returning positive results. Any student-athlete or staff member who tests positive for the virus must self-isolate for a minimum of 10 days as they monitor their health. Close contacts of those who test positive self-quarantine for a minimum of a week. UVa men\u2019s basketball player Tomas Woldetensae recently missed two games as a close contact of someone who tested positive. Virginia announced on Sunday that the senior guard would be available for Monday night\u2019s game against Miami after his two-game absence. Since testing began on July 5, UVa\u2019s athletic department has administered 24,162 tests. Of those tests, 203 have returned positive results.","779":"In the moments after his Virginia men\u2019s basketball team snapped its three-game losing streak with a Senior Night win over Miami, Tony Bennett lamented the fact that Sam Hauser never got to play in front of a true John Paul Jones Arena crowd, and remarked on just how popular the Marquette transfer would have been with the Cavaliers\u2019 fans. \u201cYou talk about becoming a fan favorite?\u201d said Bennett. \u201cI think the crowd would have appreciated [him]. The fans missed out on cool experience for themselves to watch him.\u201d On an otherwise dismal offensive night from the home team, Hauser \u2014 one of four seniors playing their final games in Charlottesville \u2014 scored 18 points to lead No. 21 UVa to a 62-51 win, clinching a double-bye in next week\u2019s ACC Tournament in Greensboro. \u201cFans or no fans, we got a win tonight,\u201d said Hauser after the game, which was played in front of about 200 family and friends of the players and staff. \u201cMy family was here to see me play. We played well as a team. I couldn\u2019t ask for much more.\u201d The injury-ravaged last-place Hurricanes hung around for much of the evening, forcing Virginia to sweat out every minute. UVa (16-6, 12-4 ACC) came in on off of road losses at Florida State and Duke and a home defeat Wednesday to North Carolina State. That slide dropped the Cavaliers into second place in the ACC and sent the once Top 10-team plummeting in the national rankings. Monday night, Hauser\u2019s offensive versatility helped staunch the bleeding. \u201cI think when the game got close, I think that\u2019s when we really came together and showed some resilience and toughness, which we hadn\u2019t in the last few games,\u201d said Hauser, who sat out last season under NCAA transfer rules. \u201cI think it was a good stepping stone for our team.\u201d Junior guard Trey Murphy III scored 12 points and sophomore forward Justin McKoy gave the Cavaliers a lift off the bench, scoring eight points and grabbing six rebounds in 21 minutes. That helped Virginia overcome a lackluster outing from its other senior star forward, Jay Huff. The 7-foot-1 Huff was held to seven points, his third lowest output of the season. Miami (7-16, 3-15), which got 14 points from guard Kameron McGusty, shot 38.5% for the game, went 4-for-15 from 3-point range and committed 11 turnovers. UVa recognized all four of its seniors \u2014 Hauser, Huff, junior college transfer Tomas Woldetensae and walk-on Austin Katstra \u2014 in a pre-game ceremony featuring tribute videos with interviews with their families and friends. Woldetensae \u2014 who missed the previous two games due to COVID-19 contact tracing, got the start on his Senior Night and scored Virginia\u2019s first basket, a 3-pointer 51 seconds into the contest. But the seniors had a mostly-quiet first half outside of Hauser\u2019s 11 points before the break. In what figured to be a get-right game for the slumping Cavaliers, last-place Miami actually came out and took at 15-12 lead before McKoy went on a personal 6-0 run \u2014 in 1:22 \u2014 to put Virginia out front 18-15 with 10:39 left in the half. After Miami reclaimed the edge, Virginia ended the half on a 14-2 run, sparked by a pair of 3-pointers from Hauser, to take a 41-30 lead to the locker room. But as it has for much of the season, the Cavaliers\u2019 Pack Line defense struggled to keep the Hurricanes out of the lane. Miami scored 18 points in the paint in the first half and finished with 26 for the game. Neither team came out hot in the second half. It took 2:31 before either squad scored, UVa finally pulling off the second-half lid from the basket when freshman guard Reece Beekman cut to the basket to score off a nifty feed from Woldetensae, putting the Cavaliers up 43-30 with 17:29 to play. That would be Virginia\u2019s only points in the first 7:31 of the second half, allowing Miami to pull within 43-37 before Huff hit a straightaway 3 with 12:28 to play. In all, the Cavaliers hit just four of their first 20 second-half shot attempts, allowing the Hurricanes to hang around. A jumper by Miami guard Isaiah Wong cut Virginia\u2019s lead to 55-49 with 3:07 to play but Virginia didn\u2019t ever let the Hurricanes get too close. Katstra finally checked into the game with 27 seconds to play. The Cavaliers play at Louisville on Saturday in the regular-season finale. The Cardinals have won back-to-back games heading into their road date at No. 22 Virginia Tech on Wednesday. A year after ending the regular season on an eight-game win streak, UVa would be content to head to Greensboro off back-to-back wins this year. As for Hauser, he thinks the team can get back to the level it was playing when it won its first seven ACC games and climbed into the Top 10 of the rankings. \u201cI have all the confidence in the world that we can get back to that level,\u201d said Hauser. \u201cI know that other guys think that, too. We know how good we can be.\u201d","780":"Miami isn\u2019t the team it expected to be in the preseason. Injuries have decimated the Hurricanes, and it showed Monday night. Virginia (16-6, 12-4 ACC) took advantage, beating Miami (7-16, 3-15 ACC) despite not playing close to its best basketball. The Cavaliers went cold from the floor in the second half, but still beat the overmatched Hurricanes, 62-51. Here are three takeaways from Virginia\u2019s win, which snapped a three-game losing streak. Welcome to March With Monday\u2019s win, Virginia improves to 11-1 in March since the start of the 2018-19 season. The Cavaliers won the national championship in the 2018-19 season, playing fantastic basketball down the stretch. Last season, UVa went 2-0 in March before COVID-19 shut the season down. This year, Virginia entered March on a three-game losing streak. Uncharacteristically, UVa was playing subpar basketball near the end of a season. The team\u2019s result improved Monday, but the performance left something to be desired yet again. UVa opened March with a win, but the team\u2019s toughest tests lie ahead. Nothing will be easy the rest of the way for the Cavaliers. They play at Louisville on Saturday. The Cardinals face Virginia Tech on Wednesday, hoping to extend their winning streak to three games. They won an overtime contest at Duke over the weekend. Following the matchup with Louisville, ACC Tournament play arrives. After that, it\u2019s the Big Dance. In all likelihood, there won\u2019t be any teams of Miami\u2019s caliber left on the schedule. It only gets more challenging from here. March has been good to UVa the past two seasons. Will it be as kind this year? Bench contributes in big way Virginia went deep into its bench Monday night. Nine players logged at least eight minutes in the first half, as Tony Bennett gave plenty of guys chances early against the Hurricanes. Later in the night, the Cavaliers were able to get senior Austin Katstra into the game in the final minute of his Senior Night. Among the most notable bench contributors was sophomore forward Justin McKoy. The active defender and aggressive rebounder showcased his offensive game Monday, knocking down jump shots and attacking the rim. As a result, he finished with eight points, six rebounds and two steals. Reece Beekman, a freshman guard, came off the bench for the first time since the ACC opener at Notre Dame on Dec. 30. Beekman had started every other conference games. Senior Tomas Woldetensae started in his place. Giving a variety of players more minutes allowed the starters to lift less of the scoring load. UVa scored 13 bench points over its last two games. It tallied 20 bench points Monday. It is unclear how well the deeper lineup might work against better teams than Miami, but players like McKoy can contribute when given opportunities. Long scoring droughts worrisome Throughout this season, UVa\u2019s offense has gone ice cold for stretches at a time. The Cavaliers dealt with that issue again Monday. After dropping 41 points in the first half, UVa scored nine points in the first 12 minutes of the second half. The offense took some decent shots, but they didn\u2019t fall. Fortunately for Virginia, the missed shots and lengthy scoring droughts didn\u2019t cost it against Miami. Virginia shot just 32.1% from the floor in the second half, making just 23.1% of its 3-pointers. The Wahoos didn\u2019t attempt a free throw in the second half after taking nine in the opening 20 minutes. When better teams arrive on the schedule, the prolonged stretches without scoring are major cause for concern. The Cavaliers possess plenty of scoring threats, but they need increased consistency on the offensive end. Players like redshirt seniors Sam Hauser and Jay Huff need to step up during those offensive lulls and take control of the game. They\u2019ve shown the ability to score against just about any foe, and Virginia desperately needs their talent and experience when the scoring slows. UVa can be great offensively, but it needs to avoid long stretches without points once single-elimination postseason play arrives.","781":"In a recent presentation to the area\u2019s Regional Transit Partnership, CAT Director Garland Williams and a consultant showed partnership members ridership data and service changes it could implement. The proposal includes a lower level, which restores pre-pandemic service hours but with several modifications, and an upper level, which would result in a 27% increase in overall service hours, and could include new weekend service and improved frequencies on some routes, as well as additional service between the University of Virginia and the U.S. 29 corridor. \u201cWe hope these service changes that are being recommended right now will help us to stem that tide of decline and turn it around to get it back to where we\u2019re increasing our ridership to work on that model that comes from the state to give us more funding,\u201d Williams said. In 2019, Williams said he was trying to increase ridership to keep the agency out of a \u201cdeath spiral\u201d due to state funding changes based on performance. Over the summer, CAT put temporary automatic passenger counters in some of its vehicles to get a better look at the ridership during the pandemic. \u201cIf you look at summer 2020 compared to summer 2019, CAT lost about half of its ridership,\u201d said James Baker, with Connetics Transportation Group. \u201cIn response to that, Garland and his team have reduced CAT service by about 30%.\u201d The data was shown to partnership members on a dashboard, but Williams said they were not sharing that with the public at this point, as it was a very small sample. The city recently put out a request for proposals to get more permanent automatic passenger counters in all of its buses. \u201cAs we roll out the APC project, and roll this out to all, this information will become very readily available to the full public,\u201d he said. Changes will need to be made due to the coming closure of the Belmont Bridge, including a modified downtown staging location, Baker said. Systemwide, they are proposing changes to make a consistent weekday and Saturday span of service \u2014 from 6 a.m. to 11 p.m. for major routes and 6:30 a.m. to 9 p.m. for all other routes. All routes operating on Sunday would run from 7:30 a.m. to 9 p.m. Some more substantial proposed changes to specific routes include modifications to Route 2 to operate bi-directionally on Avon Street, removing the Route 6 southbound deviation to the UVa Medical Center, and extending Route 7 to Walmart. If the lower-level proposal were to be fully implemented, it would increase service hours by 1% from pre-pandemic service hours, and cost the county an additional $385,877, while the city would see a decrease in costs of $599,667, according to a chart presented by Williams and Baker. If the upper-level proposal were to be fully implemented, it would increase service hours by 27% and cost the county an additional $1.4 million and cost the city an additional $593,088. Williams said the proposals are a starting point for discussions with the City Council and the Albemarle County Board of Supervisors about what they want. \u201cYou can think about this as a caf\u00e9-style model,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can get what you want, you don\u2019t have to take this format, you can pick and choose, because it\u2019s pretty much interchangeable. It just depends on the cost associated with whether you want the higher or the lower.\u201d Two transit planning efforts \u2014 a regional transit vision plan and a transit expansion study for Albemarle \u2014 are starting now with the Thomas Jefferson Planning District Commission. \u201cThese are recommendations that we\u2019re making now,\u201d Williams said. \u201cThis is not trying to contradict or discount the larger planning process that\u2019s going to happen \u2014 that\u2019s 18 months \u2014 but we are in a real need to start to turn around our declining ridership.\u201d County staff said Williams is invited to a work session on the fiscal year 2022 budget. Williams said he was setting up small meetings with city councilors to go through possible changes in more detail with them.","782":"Nearly a year ago, Mark Byington took over a James Madison men\u2019s basketball team that finished in the Colonial Athletic Association basement last season. The Virginia native did not need much time to turn the Dukes into a winner. The JMU men\u2019s basketball team has gone from worst to first, tying for the CAA regular-season title and earning the No. 1 seed in the upcoming CAA Tournament. \u201cIt definitely wasn\u2019t easy,\u201d Byington said. \u201cIt\u2019s challenging taking over a new job and kind of implementing your style and culture regardless, but in these [COVID-19] circumstances where I didn\u2019t really meet our players [in person] until ... the end of July \u2014 and we missed 26 days of practice because of a COVID pause and quarantining \u2014 it was hard for us to get it going. \u201cOnce we finally found a rhythm \u2026 in January, \u2026 I felt like we were on the right track of how to use guys to their best potential, and we went on a nice run.\u201d The Dukes are 13-6 overall and tied Northeastern for first place with an 8-2 league mark. \u201cOur mentality [is about] \u2026 not worrying about the results and just worrying about constantly getting better,\u201d Byington said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of [New England Patriots coach] Bill Belichick in focusing on the process. I truly do believe in that.\u201d Byington is a safe bet to be named the CAA\u2019s coach of the year on Friday. \u201cI think he\u2019s the coach of the year,\u201d said Martin Ingelsby, the coach of CAA member Delaware. \u201cHe did a great job getting that team to be cohesive on both ends of the floor. Credit to him and his coaching staff \u2014 they\u2019ve done a fabulous job putting that roster together.\u201d Byington stepped down as Georgia Southern\u2019s coach after seven years at the Sun Belt school to take over in Harrisonburg. JMU endured four straight losing seasons under former coach Louis Rowe. The Dukes were 9-21 overall and 2-16 in the CAA last year. \u201cA lot of times when you take over a new program, \u2026 there\u2019s resistance. There was no resistance [at JMU],\u201d Byington said. \u201cThe guys were bought in from Day 1.\u201d Georgia Southern also was a successful rebuilding job for Byington. Byington left his job as a Virginia Tech assistant to take the Georgia Southern job in 2013. In Byington\u2019s second year at the helm, Georgia Southern enjoyed its first winning season in nine years. He finished his reign at Georgia Southern with a string of six straight winning seasons. \u201cAt Georgia Southern, \u2026 we had to clean up a lot more things, whether it be academically or \u2026 whatever,\u201d Byington said. \u201cHere, it was really just trying to help them get better in basketball. There wasn\u2019t any other issues.\u201d But Byington wasn\u2019t sure how good JMU would be this year. The Dukes were picked ninth out of 10 teams in the CAA\u2019s preseason poll, although they did boast CAA preseason player of the year Matt Lewis. \u201cWe had so many new guys that it was hard to have any kind of expectations,\u201d Byington said. \u201cI bought in eight new players. There [were] five returners. \u201cWe just had the right mix \u2026 of guys who were committed to winning. They\u2019re very unselfish. And then we had a really, really good player in Matt, \u2026 and kind of built around him.\u201d After enduring a 17-day COVID-19 pause that shut down workouts in October, JMU won two of its first three games. But after beating Radford on Nov. 30, JMU did not play again until Dec. 19 because of another pause. The Dukes eventually got rolling. They average a league-high 78.5 points with their uptempo attack. \u201cI didn\u2019t know if we could get the guys to play fast because it wasn\u2019t something they were used to,\u201d Byington said. \u201cWe were able to implement our pace.\u201d Lewis leads the CAA with an average of 19.7 points. But the senior suffered a season-ending knee injury in the Dukes\u2019 penultimate regular-season game on Feb. 14. Without Lewis, JMU lost 84-78 to Drexel in last week\u2019s regular-season finale. The Dukes\u2019 seven-game winning streak was snapped, but JMU had already clinched the No. 1 seed in the league tournament. The tournament will be held Saturday through Tuesday at JMU\u2019s new arena. The Dukes will face Elon or Towson in Sunday\u2019s quarterfinals. An automatic bid to the NCAA Tournament will be at stake in the league tournament, but the Dukes will have a tough time winning the title without Lewis. \u201cHe\u2019s a really talented player. He\u2019s got aspirations for the NBA,\u201d Byington said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to miss him, but we do have some guys who are eager to prove something.\u201d","783":"Although rapidly decreasing COVID-19 case numbers among University of Virginia students led administrators to lift stay-at-home orders for students on and off Grounds last week, the school\u2019s Greek-life leaders are continuing to restrict in-person activities for fraternities and sororities. The Inter-Fraternity Council is suspending all organized in-person activity until the end of March, according to a message on the council\u2019s website. The Inter-Sorority Council, in an email sent to member chapters, suspended in-person gatherings until March 12. The decisions were announced after UVa officials reopened Grounds for student gatherings of up to six people providing masks and social distancing are observed. \u201cIn January, the Inter-Fraternity Council decided to lift the ban on in-person events after seeing widespread compliance with the restrictions in the fall,\u201d the council\u2019s Feb. 26 statement reads. \u201cSince then, there have been multiple incidents of blatant noncompliance and disrespect for the less restrictive rules. Such behavior is irresponsible, and puts the health of the university community and many Charlottesville residents in unnecessary danger.\u201d The council crackdown includes prohibiting events, whether \u201csocial, brotherhood, new member activities, etc.\u201d \u201cHousing and meal plans are the only exception to this mandate,\u201d the statement reads. \u201cIn the meantime, the [council board] will be working on ways to increase peer accountability and hold chapters accountable for their actions.\u201d UVa officials said they support the actions. \u201cWe appreciate the decision by the [fraternity council and sorority council] member chapters to revert to the suspension of all in-person activity they previously adopted for the fall semester,\u201d UVa Dean of Students Allen Groves said. \u201cThe recent concerning rise in students testing positive, now contained as a result of students cooperating with heightened restrictions from Feb. 16 to Feb. 28, shows the COVID pandemic remains a significant threat.\u201d Nearly 650 students tested positive for the virus in the first two weeks of the spring semester with a high of 229 cases reported on Feb. 16. That\u2019s the day university administrators restricted students to their residences except for trips to class, food and work. Off-Grounds students were prohibited from coming onto the campus except to attend classes. According to the UVa COVID tracker, during the 10-day crackdown COVID-19 cases dropped from a seven-day average of 109 cases per day on Feb. 20 to a seven-day average of 28 daily cases by Feb. 28. Administrators said the surge was due to the entire student body\u2019s general noncompliance with restrictions and not directly related to in-person recruitment events held by some fraternities and sororities. Those events generated fervent criticism on social media and among student activists. On Feb. 23, the UVa Student Council passed a resolution \u2018denouncing the university\u2019s negligence regarding [fraternity and sorority] violations of COVID-19 restrictions for recruitment events.\u2019 The resolution calls for a written apology that recognizes administrators\u2019 \u201cfailure to enforce their own COVID-19 restrictions.\u201d It also called for temporary suspensions of Greek organizations accused of noncompliance while the accusations are under review. At least five and as many as eight organizations, both fraternities and sororities, are said to be under investigation by university officials for possible violations of the six-person limit. The sorority council, in an Instagram post on Feb. 19, said the \u201crecklessness exhibited by some members of our community is extremely disappointing and these utterly careless actions put all of our health at risk.\u201d \u201cAlthough we mostly saw widespread compliance, social media and other platforms indicted that some chapters were not,\u201d the statement reads. \u201cThese chapters and individuals are currently undergoing the university\u2019s judicial process and the [sorority council] is discussing further mechanisms to hold our organization accountable moving forward.\u201d The fraternity council intends to reevaluate the restrictions at the end of the month. \u201cAs an organization, we feel it is critical to recognize the efforts our members have taken to prioritize safety and minimize the spread of COVID-19, and also acknowledge our shortcomings in this endeavor,\u201d the fraternity council\u2019s Feb. 26 statement reads.","784":"Virginia shot 16-over 296 during the final round for a 54-hole total of 37-over 877.

The integrated Translational Health Research Institute of Virginia, known as iTHRIV, will support a partnership of the Jefferson Area Board of Aging and University of Virginia School of Architecture to see if a variety of nature-based activities improves seniors\u2019 emotional, physical and cognitive health. It will also fund a Legal Aid Justice Center program in Charlottesville with UVa Health to identify and reduce barriers that prevent noncitizen children from enrolling in Medicaid programs for which they qualify. It will also collect information on the children\u2019s primary-care and emergency-room use. \u201ciTHRIV seeks opportunities to partner with the community to address health problems which are important to the people who live in Virginia,\u201d Kristin Miller, iTHRIV partnership manager, said Wednesday, in a prepared statement. The JABA study is the result of the pandemic\u2019s impact on seniors. The organization will join with the architecture school\u2019s Center of Design and Health to study whether nature-based activities can improve seniors\u2019 health. \u201cIsolation, any amount of time, can negatively impact emotional, physical and cognitive health. The extreme social isolation created by COVID could exacerbate these risks,\u201d said Marta Keane, of JABA. Preliminary research has indicated that using green space and getting outdoors may increase social interactions in seniors, Keane said. Jenny Roe, the design and health center\u2019s director, agreed. \u201cWe know that interacting with nature in gardens, in parks [and] in wilder settings, builds emotional, cognitive, physical and social wellbeing,\u201d Roe said. \u201cAt a time when so many older people are suffering from lack of mobility and social isolation, our research will help identify what type of nature intervention works best for health and for whom.\u201d Roe said the study will include physical approaches such as nature walks, mental approaches such as being involved in environmental issues and nurturing approaches including gardening and growing plants. The Legal Aid Justice Center\u2019s officials became involved in the iTHRIV program after noticing that many noncitizen children legally eligible for Medicaid remain uninsured. Michaela Lieberman, a staff attorney with the center, will partner with Dr. Dianne Pappas, a pediatrician at UVA Health. The goal is to identify and reduce common barriers to Medicaid enrollment and collect information on primary-care and emergency-room use. \u201cHonestly, we don\u2019t really know how many of these children and families there are in our community or what the challenges and barriers are that keep them from accessing health care,\u201d Pappas said. \u201cThe first step to improving access and health is to understand the community and the barriers that prevent them from successfully accessing the health care system.\u201d \u201cThis grant will ultimately ensure more Medicaid-eligible kids in Virginia get access to the critical healthcare services they may otherwise not be able to afford,\u201d Lieberman said. \u201cWe see this funding opportunity as an important tool in capturing and reducing a source of health inequity in the commonwealth.\u201d iTHRIV is supported by the NIH and is a collaboration of UVa, Virginia Tech, Carilion Clinic and the Inova Health System.","787":"For the second straight year, University of Virginia students on the slate to graduate will find very little pomp due to a lot of circumstances as the school has decided to forego traditional final exercises in light of the continuing COVID-19 pandemic. UVa will confer degrees to students online and produce a celebratory internet-based event for students, friends and families this May. Graduation ceremonies for the class of 2020, which were postponed until this spring due the initial pandemic outbreak, are also being shelved, said UVa President Jim Ryan, in a message to the class. Ryan discussed the postponements in two separate messages, one for each graduating class. \u201cI am sorry to say that, given the pandemic, we are not going to be able to hold final exercises as usual this May,\u201d Ryan wrote to this year\u2019s crop of seniors. \u201cThe challenge remains around the size of gatherings permitted by the Commonwealth of Virginia and travel advisories, both of which preclude us from being able to host a ceremony that families and friends can attend.\u201d Ryan said the school is consulting with 2021 class leaders to determine which of two options the class should take. Those are to hold \u201cmodified graduation events this spring that involve only our graduating students but no guests,\u201d or postponing graduation events to a future date. \u201cIn either case, we will confer degrees and produce a celebratory virtual event for students, friends, and families this May,\u201d Ryan wrote. \u201cFor those making plans, please know that we will not be able to accommodate any guests this May, regardless of whatever option we ultimately pursue.\u201d Ryan told last year\u2019s class that their ceremonies have been pushed off another year. Due to the pandemic, last year\u2019s graduates also received degrees in a virtual ritual in May with plans to combine formal ceremonies with the 2021 class. \u201cAfter consultation with the Finals 2020 Advisory Group, which includes student leaders from your class, we have decided to again postpone your in-person graduation activities to the summer of 2022,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI realize this news may come as another disappointment, and for that I am truly sorry.\u201d It\u2019s not the first time for the Class of 2020. When it became clear last year that 2020 celebrations would need to be delayed, administrators originally considered holding them in the fall during October\u2019s fall break. That didn\u2019t work out as the pandemic led the school to cancel fall break to finish in-person instruction by Thanksgiving. Ryan wrote the class in April 2020 noting that the school could not accommodate \u201cthousands of graduates and their families at the same time\u201d that classes continued. He also noted that social distancing requirements would make it nearly impossible to hold traditional graduation ceremonies. Not much has changed in the last year, thus forcing the postponement to 2022. But Ryan said the 2020 group is devising a program that will allow students to have a formal graduation combined with a two-year class reunion. \u201cThis event, which will combine elements of final exercises and an early reunion, will provide an opportunity to walk the Lawn for those who wish to do so as well as a chance to reconnect with classmates, friends, and faculty in meaningful ways,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThank you for your continued patience and understanding, and I look forward to seeing you when we gather in 2022.\u201d Ryan told the 2021 class in his letter that he regretted the decision. \u201cI regret having to deliver this news, which I know comes as a disappointment, though perhaps not a surprise,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI know this is not the way you expected to end your time at UVa, nor is it the way we would like to celebrate your accomplishments. Still, I remain confident we will be able to celebrate and honor your class in a way that will be both meaningful and memorable.\u201d","788":"Virginia baseball coach Brian O\u2019Connor realized something about his team last weekend at North Carolina, and it had nothing to do with the Cavaliers\u2019 on-field performance. \u201cI tell you the biggest thing that I learned is how much our players eat,\u201d O\u2019Connor said Tuesday. \u201cIt is incredible.\u201d In a normal season, O\u2019Connor and his staff give their players meal money and student-athletes grab food with teammates or family members. This season, due to one of many COVID-19 protocols, the team gets food delivered to avoid potential exposure to the virus. \u201cWhen you\u2019re having to actually deliver them everything that goes into their mouth, I just can\u2019t believe, maybe at that age I ate that much, I don\u2019t know, but it\u2019s just one thing after another,\u201d O\u2019Connor said. While O\u2019Connor joked about his team\u2019s appetite, an ACC road series in 2021 comes with major challenges. UVa\u2019s next road ACC test is this weekend\u2019s series at Florida State, which begins Friday at 6 p.m. A shortened MLB Draft this offseason led to an influx of returning talent, making the league arguably the best it\u2019s been in the past 10 years. Seven ACC teams were included in the latest D1 Baseball top 25 poll, including UVa (5-3, 1-2 ACC) at No. 16. The Seminoles (2-4, 0-3 ACC) weren\u2019t ranked this week, but they entered the season in the top 25. The conference is loaded with talent, and playing on the road only enhances the challenge of winning a series. Road trips mean following strict health protocols to limit exposure to COVID-19. The team used three busses to travel to North Carolina last weekend. Sophomore Max Cotier only experienced one road series last season, and he never played an ACC road game until facing UNC. Cotier says the experience in 2021 isn\u2019t too bad, and the biggest adjustment for him is the spacing on the bus. \u201cI got my own seat on the bus,\u201d Virginia\u2019s second baseman smiled. \u201cSo I\u2019m OK with that.\u201d Cotier enjoys the extra space during travel, but following protocols against a team as far away from Charlottesville as Florida State presents a challenge. The coaching staff worries about COVID-19 in addition to the planning required to beat some of the best teams in the country. Once the team safely arrives at its road destination, the on-field challenges are massive. UNC\u2019s stellar pitching staff stifled UVa\u2019s lineup last weekend, allowing just six runs. The Cavaliers have scored two or fewer runs three times this season, going 1-2 in those contests. They\u2019re hoping to build off a good showing Tuesday, when they posted 11 runs against George Washington. \u201cWe need to keep going back to our fundamentals and what we\u2019re taught,\u201d senior outfielder Brendan Rivoli said after the win. Rivoli says the team tried to hit the \u201creset button\u201d heading into the George Washington game. He felt the Cavaliers were swinging at bad pitches in the UNC series, giving the Tar Heels the advantage most at-bats. Against Florida State, plate discipline can prove to be an advantage. The Seminoles are walking an average of 6.8 batters per game, the most in the ACC. O\u2019Connor wants his team to start innings with better at-bats. \u201cI think I can count it on one hand the amount of times in 27 innings that we had a leadoff guy on,\u201d O\u2019Connor said of the UNC series. \u201cAnd [against George Washington] we had five out of the eight innings, and certainly it makes a difference in your offensive production.\u201d The Cavaliers head to Tallahassee hoping to win an ACC series. When they have time in between meals, their focus lies squarely on offensive production.","789":"In a statement on the school's website, officials said the school is consulting with the current senior class about either holding events in the spring that involve only graduating students, or postponing a ceremony and other events to a future date when families and friends can join students. Under either scenario, the school said it will confer the degrees to the candidates in each school virtually and produce a virtual celebration for students, friends and families this May. \u201cI know this is not the way you expected to end your time at UVA, nor is it the way we would like to celebrate your accomplishments,\u201d UVa President Jim Ryan said. \u201cStill, I remain confident we will be able to celebrate and honor your class in a way that will be both meaningful and memorable.\u201d In a separate message, Ryan told the class of 2020 that because of ongoing challenges of safe travel and gathering due to the pandemic, that class won't get a large ceremony or event. The pandemic forced the school to hand out degrees to that class last May in a virtual celebration with plans to hold final, in-person exercises this May. Now, Ryan said the school has postponed in-person activities for the class of 2020 until the summer of 2022. \"\u201cThis event, which will combine elements of Final Exercises and an early reunion, will provide an opportunity to walk the Lawn for those who wish to do so, as well as a chance to reconnect with classmates, friends, and faculty in meaningful ways,\u201d Ryan wrote.","790":" COVID-19 care providers at the University of Virginia Medical Center saw a nearly 50% drop in patients in the last month after their patient load peaked in December and January. Dr. Costi Sifri, director of hospital epidemiology at UVa, told the UVa Health System Board on Thursday that COVID wards averaged 60 to 70 patients a day during the surge, about half of whom were in the intensive care unit. \u201cOver the last several weeks, we\u2019ve seen a large decrease in our hospitalized patients and now are at a steady state with approximately 30 patients each day, with a little more than half of those being in the ICU,\u201d Sifri said. Sifri told the board that a sudden surge of COVID cases in the school\u2019s student body in February did not lead to an increase in hospitalizations. Medical Center officials also told the board that the hospital\u2019s care of COVID patients rates among the top for academic hospitals in the country. According to a report presented to the board, UVa was ninth out of 26 academic medical centers for COVID treatment. Statistics kept by administrators also saw improvement in the hospital\u2019s death rate, its rate of clostridium difficile infections and deep vein thrombosis pulmonary embolisms, and hospital-associated pressure injuries also improved. However, dealing with the pandemic and traditional patients has taken a toll on staff, officials said. \u201cWe\u2019ve learned to care for both COVID patients and simultaneously serve non-COVID patients that seek our care,\u201d Dr. K. Craig Kent, UVa\u2019s executive vice president for health affairs, told the health board during the virtual meeting. \u201cBut you need to know that our health care team is really weary. They have been working very hard and I\u2019d say many are worn out,\u201d Kent said. \u201cAt the same time, we\u2019re incredibly proud of the service we provide our community, our region and, in many cases, our state and nation.\u201d Information presented to the board showed that the Medical Center had nearly 500 fewer employees during the past six months. \u201cTotal paid employees for all business units, including contracted employees, were 492 under budget,\u201d the report states. \u201cContract labor is composed primarily of nurse travelers and individuals employed by the School of Medicine and contracted to the Medical Center.\u201d Those lapsed salaries, and an increase of patients whose bills were paid, helped the hospital to overcome higher COVID-related costs and fewer patients and turn in a positive financial operating margin for the first part of the system\u2019s current fiscal year. According to information presented to the board, operating income hit $24.6 million. After expenses and fund transfers, that amounts to a 2.7% operating margin, the documents show. \u201cOverall, the Health System\u2019s operating income is favorable to budget for the six months ended Dec. 31, despite the pandemic,\u201d a financial report presented to the board states. The report shows financial cuts and budget changes that management made to respond to the pandemic successfully offset its impacts, including the disruption of planned surgeries and procedures that curbed revenue. Also helping to bolster the budget was a higher-than-expected mix of patients whose treatment was paid by insurance companies, themselves or other entities. Many of those patients were also sicker. \u201cIn addition to mitigation efforts, the patient population for the first two quarters had a higher acuity, which also contributed to net revenue,\u201d the report states. At the meeting\u2019s end, the board approved a proposed purchase of the privately owned Monticello Community Surgery Center in Albemarle County to help augment the Medical Center\u2019s operating room facilities. The approval came at the end of a closed-door session during which the board discussed legal, financial and strategic issues. \u201cThe acquisition of Monticello Community Surgery Center by UVa Medical Center will provide four additional operating rooms and one procedure room. This increased capacity will improve patient care and allow providers to reduce waiting times for surgical procedures, thereby increasing case volume and associated revenue,\u201d the proposal states. The center, on U.S. 29 near Hilton Heights Road, opened in 2003 and was affiliated at the time with Martha Jefferson Hospital. The clinic owners split from MJH in 2012 when the hospital was bought by Sentara Health Care. The center has been unique in the area for putting procedural prices on its website. Officials could not say if that would continue should the proposed sale go through. The purchase requires Board of Visitors approval, but it is in keeping with strategic plans drawn for the system. In February, UVa health officials announced a plan to buy outright the Northern Virginia and Culpeper hospitals and facilities that it currently owns in partnership with Novant Health. Currently, UVa owns 40% of the Novant Health UVa Health System. The purchase will give UVa ownership of the Culpeper Medical Center, Haymarket Medical Center and Prince William Medical Center. UVa also will own and operates urgent care centers, imaging centers, family and specialist doctors\u2019 offices, physical therapy and rehab centers across the northern part of the state. That deal is expected to be completed by July 1.","791":"The calendar reads March, but the Virginia men\u2019s basketball team\u2019s resume still lacks signature wins. Tony Bennett\u2019s group has a chance for a much-needed Quad 1 victory Saturday night at Louisville. The matchup comes against a top 50 team in the NET rankings in a hostile environment that will allow more than 5,000 fans for the matchup after Kentucky recently loosened COVID-19 restrictions. The Cardinals were previously allowing just over 3,000 fans per game. \u201cIf the tequila bar is open, it\u2019ll be a pretty lively atmosphere I\u2019m sure,\u201d Bennett joked on his weekly radio show. Louisville (13-5, 8-4 ACC) is 26-2 at home since the start of last season, with its only home losses coming to Florida State. The Cardinals beat Virginia 80-73 in Louisville a season ago. Five of UVa\u2019s six losses have come away from home or in neutral site games. Should UVa (16-6, 12-4 ACC) win, it\u2019ll provide a boost to the team\u2019s NCAA Tournament seeding profile and confidence to a team that\u2019s lost three of its last four games. The Cavaliers are 0-2 against teams in the top four in the ACC standings. They\u2019ll have a chance to beat one of the ACC\u2019s top four teams Saturday, and they\u2019ll need their best. After losing to North Carolina by 45 points three games ago following a lengthy break from action due to COVID-19, the Cardinals rattled off wins over Notre Dame and Duke. Led by Radford transfer Carlik Jones, who averages 17.6 points per game, the Cardinals are one of the top teams in the conference. \u201cThey had some pauses and they had some delays and they struggled, but they look like they\u2019re getting their stride back and they can play,\u201d Bennett said. Jones leads the Cardinals\u2019 offense, while good athletes on the perimeter define the team\u2019s defense. In conference action, Louisville\u2019s 3-point field goal defense has been exceptional. The Cardinals lead the conference in the category during ACC play, allowing the opposition to shoot just 28.9% from beyond the arc. UVa excels from beyond the arc, ranking second in the league in 3-point shooting percentage. The Cavaliers make nearly 40% of their shots from deep. \u201cI think our coaches do a great job doing our personnel, just telling us who are shooters who are drivers, and I think the team has kind of took pride in learning our personnel,\u201d Jones said. Film study is important to the Cardinals\u2019 efforts, Jones says. He believes they defend the 3-point line well because they know which players are threats to shoot it. With the team\u2019s midweek game against Virginia Tech canceled due to virus issues with the Hokies, the group had even more time to lock in on UVa film. While finding quality 3-point looks might not be easy for the Cavaliers, Louisville struggles to stop 2-point shot attempts. Only Boston College allows a higher 2-point shooting percentage in ACC play than the Cardinals. With senior center Malik Williams out with injury, Louisville typically leans on 6-8 freshman Jae\u2019Lyn Withers at the center position. That opens up a potential mismatch for UVa redshirt senior center Jay Huff in the post. The ACC Player of the Year candidate is shooting 67.7% from inside the 3-point line. The Cavaliers may opt to toss him the ball in the paint, especially given the effectiveness of Louisville\u2019s 3-point defense. \u201cEvery time I see him it seems like he grows,\u201d Louisville head coach Chris Mack said. \u201cI\u2019m anxious to see how tall he is this time around, but seven-foot-one I never feel like does it justice.\u201d Mack praised Huff\u2019s 3-point shooting and finishing ability on lob plays. The center is about as efficient as any player in the ACC. Without the same experienced size as Virginia, stopping Huff might be Louisville\u2019s biggest challenge. UVa has potential mismatch opportunities with its frontcourt standouts. The Cavaliers hold the pieces to pick up a win on the road, but they\u2019ll need a better effort than the road performances at Virginia Tech and Florida State earlier this season. It\u2019ll be a challenge given the potential crowd environment allowed this weekend. \u201cWe might not have the same amount of fans, but the energy in the gym, how hard the fans go for the team is pretty amazing,\u201d Jones said. \u201cI\u2019ve had a great experience. I\u2019ve loved it all year long.\u201d","792":"University of Virginia students will have to wait to find out how much their tuition will cost next year as the university\u2019s Board of Visitors on Friday postponed a decision until after Gov. Ralph Northam has signed the state\u2019s next budget into law. The board is debating raising tuition as much as 3.1%, keeping level or raising it somewhere in between. The 3.1% is based on the nationwide rise in the cost of providing a college education, plus 1%. The vote was shelved by Board of Visitors at its Friday meeting as officials said they are unsure whether the legislature\u2019s recently approved budget will be altered by Northam. Board members said it will take time to determine the budget\u2019s impacts. \u201cWe have decided to defer any discussion of fees, room and board at today\u2019s meeting,\u201d said Bob Blue, a member of the Board of Visitors and lead of the board\u2019s finance committee. \u201cAs fiduciaries of the university, one of our most important roles is to do what\u2019s right for the long term with respect to the university.\u201d Blue, who is the president and CEO of Dominion Energy, said the university already took steps to mitigate COVID\u2019s financial impacts but how the state budget will affect the school is still unknown. \u201cRight now we don\u2019t have a total picture of the Commonwealth\u2019s budget situation. The budget passed by the state legislature a few days ago is complex. As a result, we want to give management more time to work on its implications for UVa,\u201d Blue said. Blue noted that Northam has until the end of March to sign the budget or propose amendments. \u201cIt makes sense for us to take a little more time so that we have all the facts before we make a decision,\u201d he said. UVa staff agreed. \u201cWe saw a significant difference between the governor\u2019s proposed budget, House and Senate and then, ultimately, the final conference report that came out on [Feb. 27],\u201d said J.J. Davis, UVa executive vice president and COO. Davis said the state budget, as passed, currently calls for and funds a 5% salary increase for classified staff. The budget gives schools the leeway to raise salaries for faculty and other staff beginning July 1. \u201cThe issue here for us is that compensation is typically a partially funded mandate with the university needing to provide significant resources, which is typically [through] tuition,\u201d Davis said. The Board of Visitors\u2019 next meeting is scheduled for June, but the board could call a special meeting to determine tuition and fees before then. Besides the possible tuition hike, the school is proposing a $114 increase in fees, including $75 to pay for expanding student health and wellness services and a new wellness facility. The remaining fee increase will pay for improvements to recreational facilities and Newcomb Hall. Based on tuition, fees and other expenses listed by UVa for the 2020-2021 school year, an in-state undergraduate in the arts and sciences school would see a tuition and fee increase of about $554 a year. That would bring total tuition and fees to about $17,860. Including room and board, food, books and personal expenses as estimated by the university for the 2020-20221 school year, an increase would push costs for students and families to about $34,600 a year. A 3.1% hike in out of state tuition would be an estimated increase of $1,489, bringing tuition and fees charged nonresidents to about $53,417. With current existing cost of books and room and board, nonresident students would pay about $70,200 a year. Different schools within the university charge different tuition rates and graduate schools often charge more. The current fiscal year saw pandemic-limited incomes for the school and increases in the cost of providing classes and creating safe facilities. Athletics and other activities that earned the school money also saw steep cuts. At a Feb. 17 special hearing on the tuition proposal, about two dozen students addressed the UVa board in the virtual meeting asking that tuition remain the same for next year. Students noted a survey that showed between 58% and 64% of students, depending on their ethnicity, believe an increase would be detrimental to their studies. They also noted that last spring several schools, including William and Mary, Virginia Commonwealth University and Virginia Tech voted to hold 2020-2021 tuition at the 2019-2020 fiscal year rate, citing the pandemic\u2019s impacts on the economy. Virginia State University has indicated it will not raise tuition for 2021-2022. UVa officials have noted that state funding cuts over the years has not been made up by tuition increases. The university estimates that it costs $3,648 per student more to run the school than tuition and state funds cover. That money is covered through a variety of other funding sources, including donors and investment earnings. Administrators said about 42 cents of every dollar raised in tuition or received from state funds pays for faculty salaries. They estimated that 35 cents of each dollar goes for academic support services, including libraries, student advising and technology. About 8 cents of the tuition buck go to support graduate teaching assistants; a nickel goes to facilities and utilities; another nickel goes to administration; 4 cents goes to student support including the Dean of Students office; and 1 cent goes to public outreach.","793":"Now, the new B.F. Yancey Heritage and History Exhibit traces the story of the school over an even longer period. It starts with the Reconstruction Era and ends with the closure of Yancey Elementary. There\u2019s just one catch: Because of the COVID pandemic, it\u2019s not open to the public at present. But Ed Brooks, the community center\u2019s program coordinator, hopes that can change later this year. The exhibit was coordinated by Peggy Scott and Charlotte Brody, with help from historian Hannah Scruggs. It was funded by grants from Heal Charlottesville, Virginia Humanities and Preservation Piedmont through Virginia Organizing. Albemarle-based Gropen Inc. made and installed the displays. Many thanks to all who made this exhibit possible.","794":"Sam Hauser came to Virginia to compete for a championship. On Saturday in Louisville, the Marquette transfer made sure he got one. Hauser scored a season-high 24 points to lead No. 21 UVa to a 68-58 road win over the Cardinals, a victory that clinched the ACC regular-season title and the No. 1 seed in next week\u2019s conference tournament. \u201cI\u2019ve never been a part of a championship team until now,\u201d said Hauser. \u201cSo, for me, this is a first in college. I\u2019m just excited that we got it.\u201d Junior guard Trey Murphy III scored 17 points, senior forward Jay Huff added 10 and, in its regular-season finale, Virginia\u2019s defense was in championship form, especially in the first half. \u201cIt was just one of those games where you get a couple to go and the basket kind of opens up and it looks bigger,\u201d said Hauser. \u201cI hit some big ones, but overall, it was our defense that won this game.\u201d Louisville senior guard Carlik Jones, a transfer from Radford, was held to six points on 2-for-15 shooting, a credit to UVa junior guard Kihei Clark\u2019s stout on-ball play. Jones\u2019s ACC player of the year argument took a hit as he missed his first nine shots Saturday, before finally getting on the board with 6:50 and UVa up 36-28. Sophomore guard David Johnson led the Cardinals with 14 points. Virginia coach Tony Bennett, who improved to 12-2 against Louisville while coaching the Cavaliers, became the first coach not from Duke or North Carolina to win four outright ACC regular-season titles. He joked the team would \u201cput a mask on the ACC trophy, for sure.\u201d All joking aside, Bennett\u2019s bunch \u2014 on an eight-game win streak when the 2020 postseason was cut short due to the COVID-19 pandemic \u2014 persevered through a college basketball regular season unlike any other, one disjointed by game cancellations and postponements and player and coach unavailability due to positive tests for the virus and contact tracing. The Cavaliers (17-6, 13-4 ACC) won their first seven league games, but also suffered a three-game losing streak in mid-February, a slide that began with a 81-60 thumping by Florida State. Despite all of that, UVA heads to Greensboro next week as the tournament\u2019s top seed. \u201cIt\u2019s been a unique year, to say the least,\u201d said Bennett. \u201cWe\u2019ll remember it always.\u201d Saturday, Virginia came out like a team with a title in its sights. An early 6-0 run pushed UVa out to a 14-6 lead with 11:20 to play in the first half and with Louisville struggling to hit shots, the Cavaliers never lost the edge. The Cardinals (13-5, 8-4) went just 8-for-29 shooting in the first half (27.6%). Jones was particularly humbled, missing all eight of his attempts before the break. Louisville didn\u2019t score in the final 3:09 of the half, missing its last seven shots before heading to the locker room down 28-21. The Cavaliers went 0-for-6 from 3-point range in the opening 20 minutes, including an 0-for-3 showing from Hauser. But he still scored 10 of his points in the first half. Hauser broke UVa\u2019s 3-point slump in the second half, putting the Cavaliers up 39-29 with 15:56 remaining. But a 9-2 run by Louisville cut Virginia\u2019s lead to 41-38 with 13:45 to play. UVa led 51-47 with 9:39 to play when Bennett sat Hauser and Huff for a breather and left what appeared to be an offensively-deficient lineup on the floor. But the Cavaliers \u2014 led by Murphy and sophomore forward Justin McKoy \u2014 responded with an 14-4 run that gave Virginia a 65-51 edge with 4:44 left. \u201cJustin gave us really valuable minutes,\u201d said Murphy. \u201cWe were just very connected the entire time.\u201d That lead was more than enough for UVa, which clinched its third regular-season ACC championship in the last four years. Notre Dame\u2019s upset of No. 11 Florida State \u2014 last season\u2019s league champion \u2014 earlier Saturday opened the door for Virginia to finish atop the league standings. The Irish\u2019s 83-73 home win was its first over ranked team since 2017. The ACC Tournament starts Tuesday in Greensboro. With one of the four double-byes, UVa won\u2019t play its first game there until Thursday in the quarterfinals. Florida State, Virginia Tech and Georgia Tech grabbed the other three double-byes. The Yellow Jackets moved ahead of Louisville based on winning percentage. Last year, the ACC Tournament was stopped before Virginia could take the floor. This year, the Cavaliers hope the event will be a launching point for its showing in the NCAAs. \u201cAt the start of the year, this one was one of our goals,\u201d said Hauser. \u201cCheck the box off, but we\u2019ve got a lot more to do.\u201d","795":"RICHMOND \u2014 Among Virginia\u2019s 57,000 classified state employees, Black workers are underrepresented in leadership positions, and Hispanics are hardly represented in the state workforce at all. Those are some of the issues state officials hope to address through a new statewide plan that would require efforts on equity, diversity and inclusion in every state agency, and to ensure those principles are reflected in the way each agency serves Virginia\u2019s increasingly diverse population. The ONE Virginia plan, developed by the state\u2019s Office of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion, was recently made public as the legislature approved measures and funding to implement it across the state. \u201cInequity had a 401-year head start here. It\u2019s easy to say, we\u2019re not moving quickly enough, and I agree,\u201d said Chief Diversity Officer Janice Underwood in an interview. \u201cRacism has been institutionalized, and we now have to do that with diversity and inclusion,\u201d by making them institutional, she said. The key tenets of the plan will soon be codified under a bill Del. Alex Askew, D-Virginia Beach, introduced on behalf of the administration. The bill would require that agency heads \u201cestablish and maintain\u201d diversity, equity and inclusion plans and submit an annual report to the governor on their progress. \u201cThe ONE Virginia Plan is a strategic blueprint to institutionalize equity across state government and effectively address deeply-rooted structural and systemic barriers to access and opportunity,\u201d Gov. Ralph Northam said in a statement. \u201cThis roadmap will ensure our efforts are accompanied by accountability, measurable results, and sustained impact.\u201d The plan is a guide for state agency leaders to tackle diversity and equity issues according to the reality and needs of their particular agency. The goals are the same for every agency, as is the approach: find data-driven ways to measure progress and hold the organization accountable for lack of progress. The five goals every agency will face are: recruit and retain a diverse workforce; create and sustain an agency culture that affirms and respects diversity and inclusion; educate workers on diversity and inclusion; create infrastructure within the agency to track progress on equity goals; and ensure that its work with the general public benefits \u201call of Virginia\u2019s diverse communities.\u201d *** Little public data exists on agency culture, but state demographic data suggests there is work to be done on representation. While Black people are well represented in the classified workforce statewide \u2014 29% compared with the state\u2019s 20% Black population \u2014 their representation drops to 16% among people in leadership positions. For Hispanics, who represent one in 10 Virginians, low representation numbers \u2014 2.5% \u2014 drop to even more dismal levels among people in leadership positions \u2014 1.3%. The 57,000 classified employees are essentially Virginia\u2019s version of the civil service \u2014 core state government workers who are not political appointees. All told, Virginia has more than 100,000 state employees and state-supported workers. Underwood said addressing the diversity of people the government hires is not enough; she said making sure workers are able to equitably advance in their careers and that the climate of every agency is inclusive are key goals of the plan. Broadly, she said, the plan seeks to weave the principles of equity into every nook and cranny of state government. \u201cEveryone talks about equity like they\u2019re equity aficionados. There are so many soundbites about some diversity initiative,\u201d Underwood said. \u201cFew people know how to operationalize it. In Virginia, we\u2019re actually doing something.\u201d Underwood, previously Old Dominion University\u2019s diversity director, tapped former colleagues in higher education to help spearhead the plan\u2019s development. That includes Kevin McDonald, who leads diversity efforts at the University of Virginia. UVa hired McDonald in the aftermath of the Unite the Right white supremacist rally in August 2017 that shook Charlottesville and the nation. McDonald explained that the plan is inspired by the Inclusive Excellence ideal developed by the Association of American Colleges and Universities. He said the ONE Virginia plan leaves it up to agencies to decide the metrics they\u2019ll use to measure progress, allowing flexibility but requiring accountability. \u201cThere is commitment at the highest levels of leadership that this is important,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want it to just be rhetoric. And that the action is connected to metrics.\u201d He added: \u201cDiversity has moved from being the right thing to do, to a need to weave it into the organizational fabric and bake this into their organizations.\u201d McDonald and Underwood said they\u2019re excited to see state agencies use the framework, but said it would also be useful to higher education institutions, nonprofits, municipalities, school districts and private businesses. \u201cI\u2019m certainly prioritizing state agencies, but I\u2019m still looking at how other organizations can use it. I\u2019ve spoken to school districts, for-profit organizations and local governments,\u201d Underwood said. McDonald added that UVa\u2019s work will reflect the ONE Virginia approach. *** Underwood became the state\u2019s first director of diversity, equity and inclusion in September of 2019, as Northam sought to repair his public image following the discovery of a racist photo on his page in his medical school yearbook. Northam vowed to dedicate the remainder of his time in office to racial equity, and hired Underwood to help with equity and inclusiveness within his administration and state government. Underwood accepted what was at the time a temporary position; last spring, the legislature codified her role as a permanent Cabinet position. Underwood was tasked with developing a plan to promote inclusive practices and address systemic inequities in state government, while \u201cfostering an inclusive environment throughout state government where employees feel a sense of belonging,\u201d according to the job posting. She has also been regularly tapped to speak publicly on behalf of the administration when it is facing issues of race or equity. Most recently, that has included issues of disparity related to the spread of COVID-19, including testing and vaccine distribution. Recently, Underwood\u2019s office was involved in helping the Virginia Department of Health fix a fumbled, Google-translate version of the state\u2019s vaccine preregistration form. Underwood has grown her office to a team of four people with the hires of Alaysia Black Hackett, the deputy chief diversity officer; Mona Siddiqui, the assistant diversity officer and senior policy adviser; and Yewande Austin, special adviser to the chief diversity officer. On Friday, Northam announced the appointment of one more staffer: Kimberly Cain, who will also serve as a special adviser. The budget the General Assembly approved includes $200,000 to fund contractors within Underwood\u2019s office who will help 10 state agencies pilot the ONE Virginia framework. The funding is meant to help the state gauge the \u201ccontent, complexity and level of effort\u201d involved in the work. As Northam nears the end of his term next January, the administration has sought to cement some of its work to make it more resistant to changes by future governors. In addition to Underwood\u2019s role becoming permanent, the administration wants to make its diversity requirements for state agencies a part of the Virginia code. The bill would require agency leaders to not just create diversity plans, but weave them into their operations and how their agencies interact with the public. \u201cThe plan shall integrate the diversity, equity and inclusion goals into the agency\u2019s mission, operations, programs and infrastructure to enhance equitable opportunities for the populations served by the agency and to foster an increasingly diverse, equitable and inclusive workplace environment,\u201d the bill reads. Askew also noted that the annual report to the governor on progress would include the impact of the work on the state\u2019s budget. Askew\u2019s bill passed the House along party lines, 55-44, with all Republicans voting in opposition. In the Senate, the bill passed in a 26-13 vote, with the support of five Republicans: Siobhan Dunnavant of Henrico, Emmet Hanger of Augusta, Jen Kiggans of Virginia Beach, Todd Pillion of Washington and Jill Vogel of Fauquier. As for the House vote, Askew said: \u201cIt turned out to be a partisan bill, even though I didn\u2019t want it to be. This bill ultimately strives to make an equitable workplace for everyone.\u201d","796":"Jay Huff looked for wood to knock on. Sam Hauser said he\u2019d cross his fingers. Kihei Clark said he hoped other teams were keeping safe. As Virginia prepares to return to Greensboro for the ACC Tournament, nearly a year after last season\u2019s event was cut short due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the conference\u2019s regular-season champions do so with a mix of excitement and anxiety. \u201cI think it\u2019s not only in the back our heads, but I think it\u2019s in the back of a lot of teams\u2019 heads, now with what\u2019s at stake,\u201d said Hauser, a senior forward. \u201cIf you get hit with a Corona problem, you might be done. \u2026 Try not to worry about it as much but it\u2019s hard not to in these times.\u201d No. 16 UVa (17-6) earned a double bye as the tournament\u2019s top seed, meaning it won\u2019t take the floor in Greensboro until Thursday in the quarterfinals, when it will face the winner of Wednesday\u2019s game between North Carolina State (13-9) and Syracuse (15-8). Virginia had a double bye last year and was shooting around at a nearby gym on March 12, hours before its game against Notre Dame, when it got the call that the tournament had been canceled due to concerns over the spread of the COVID-19 virus. Those Cavaliers had won eight straight and were emerging as contenders to defend the national championship they won in 2019. Instead, the postseason was over, the red carpet summarily yanked out from beneath their Nikes before playing a game. \u201cYou want to play all the games you can,\u201d said Clark, a junior point guard. \u201cYou always have that feeling in the back of your head. Could it get canceled? You don\u2019t know what other teams are doing. Hopefully everybody\u2019s staying safe and we\u2019re able to continue with the tournament this year.\u201d Assuming that\u2019s the case, that Huff and Hauser\u2019s superstitious wood-knocking and finger-crossing, combined with the team\u2019s COVID-19 safety protocols, do their job, UVa is about to play in a tournament that is as wide open as its been in years. Virginia sat in first place for much of the year before a three-game losing streak dropped it behind Florida State. Then, a stunning upset of the Seminoles by Notre Dame in the regular-season finale Saturday opened the door for UVa to win its third regular-season championship in the last four years. It accomplished that with a resounding road win over Louisville, stifling the Cardinals and their star, guard Carlik Jones, and riding the hot shooting of Hauser to a 68-58 win that clinched the championship and the top seed. The league\u2019s blue bloods \u2014 Duke (11-11) and North Carolina (16-9) \u2014 finished 10th and sixth respectively, meaning the Blue Devils will be playing a first-round game on Tuesday when play in Greensboro tips off. Florida State (15-5), Virginia Tech (15-5) and Georgia Tech (15-8) grabbed the other two double-byes, finishing second, third and fourth. \u201cI think it is anybody\u2019s tournament at this point, maybe more so than normal years,\u201d said Huff. Anybody who can remain free of virus issues for the next week, of course. \u201cThey say, \u2018Survive and advance,\u2019 is the tournament [motto],\u201d said UVa coach Tony Bennett. \u201cIt\u2019s almost, \u2018Be negative and advance,\u2019 is maybe the term it should be for the COVID season.\u201d The Cavaliers\u2019 path to advancing could lead them to a rematch with either the Seminoles or Hokies, both of whom beat UVa during the regular season. Those are matchups the players said they\u2019d be eager for, though Bennett said he\u2019d just be happy to be playing in the championship game Saturday, regardless of the opponent. And, after everything the players have gone through since last March\u2019s cancellation, just playing has been a treat in and of itself. \u201cIt\u2019s a year where I honestly wasn\u2019t even sure if we were going to have college basketball,\u201d said Huff. \u201cSo the fact that we\u2019ve been able to make it this far, to have an ACC Tournament, to have an NCAA tournament, it\u2019s great for me. Honestly, this season was just the cherry on top. I was nervous we wouldn\u2019t have it so I\u2019m glad we\u2019ve been able to make it this far.\u201d","797":"It\u2019s been an eventful 23 months since the Virginia men\u2019s basketball team won the 2018-19 national championship. The Cavaliers won 23 games in 2019-2020, including their last eight of the season, but the year was cut short due to the COVID-19 pandemic. They returned this year with new faces, but still won the ACC regular-season title despite a season with frequent postponements and empty arenas. About the only thing absent from UVa\u2019s historic and hectic past 23 months has been a single-elimination tournament game. That changes Thursday. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty simple,\u201d redshirt senior Jay Huff said. \u201cIt\u2019s win or go home, so you gotta bring you\u2019re \u2018A\u2019 game and just kind of have that understanding that this could be it.\u201d Assuming COVID-19 doesn\u2019t cut the season short, UVa is still only guaranteed two games the rest of this season. Thursday at noon, the Cavaliers face the winner of Syracuse and N.C. State in the ACC Tournament quarterfinals. After that, the Cavaliers will be invited to the NCAA Tournament. The pressure ramps up beginning this week. After nearly two calendar years away from it, Virginia returns to postseason play. \u201cEvery possession matters even more this time of the year,\u201d redshirt senior Sam Hauser said. \u201cWe know that. I guess you just kind of have to come in and play free and let the chips fall where they fall and you live with it, but obviously you want to win.\u201d Fortunately for UVa, its players have been in big moments over the last few years even without ACC Tournament or NCAA Tournament games in recent memory. Even some players who weren\u2019t with the program during the national title run, like Hauser and freshman guard Reece Beekman, still have big-game experience to draw upon. Beekman won a state championship in Louisiana in 2020, posting a triple-double in the state title game. He won a state title every year during his high school playing days. Hauser helped lead the Cavaliers to a regular-season championship this season, scoring his UVa career-high of 24 points in the regular-season finale at Louisville. He helped carry the team in a game with important stakes. \u201cIn a way, the Louisville game for us was a single-elimination game in terms of, if you can win a conference regular-season title and how special that would be,\u201d head coach Tony Bennett said. \u201cThat was that mindset.\u201d Other players on the roster, like Huff and junior guard Kihei Clark, were on the national title team. They\u2019ve reached the peak of the sport. Despite nearly two years away from single-elimination tournaments, they understand what\u2019s needed to win big games. Last season, Virginia went 9-1 in games decided by three points or fewer. UVa has also won eight consecutive games played in March with the last loss coming to Florida State in the ACC Tournament in 2018-19. \u201cLate in March, everybody is playing their best basketball,\u201d Clark said. \u201cYou got to be at your best and just try not to have those self-inflicted errors.\u201d Clark stressed that avoiding turnovers and defensive lapses are crucial when it comes to advancing deep into tournaments. The margin of error can be thin this time of year, as the team learned well during its national title run. UVa won all six of its NCAA Tournament games in 2019, including its last four in overtime or by four points or fewer. Virginia came close to losing on numerous occasions, only to make the clutch play or two needed to win the tournament. Bennett shared that sometimes in a single-elimination format you just have to be fortunate. The Cavaliers had good fortunes in 2019, while also executing at a high level with a talented roster. The year prior, UVa made history by becoming the first men's No. 1 seed to lose to a No. 16 seed when it fell to UMBC in the opening round of the NCAA Tournament. Postseason play brings with it tremendous highs and lows, and the Cavaliers know both sides well. UVa hopes recent positive postseason results translate into this season as they aim for their first ACC Tournament title since 2018. \u201cI haven\u2019t won an ACC championship conference tournament,\u201d Clark said. \u201cThat\u2019d be cool.\u201d","798":"March 11, 2020 was a day filled with cautious optimism for the University of Virginia's student-athletes. The date turned out to be the last day of athletic competition for six months, but it started with hope and excitement. The UVa baseball team hosted hundreds of kids for Field Trip Day, and the Cavaliers beat UMass Lowell 4-3 in a surprisingly competitive game. The youngsters, excited to be outside for the day, screamed throughout the first six innings before having to head home. \u201cI just remember it was really loud,\u201d sixth-year baseball pitcher Stephen Schoch said. \u201cIt was the loudest Disharoon Park has been since I\u2019ve been here. It was packed.\u201d The game was fun. Schoch, who came into the game in relief and earned the win for Virginia, remembers spending the first seven innings in the bullpen. A graduate transfer from UMBC, he knew UMass Lowell well from his time in the America East Conference. As a result, he wasn\u2019t focused much on the scouting report. Instead of worrying about the game plan, he felt a sense of gratitude. As hundreds of kids energetically supported his team, he thought about how fortunate he was to be a college student still playing what he calls \u201ca child\u2019s game.\u201d \u201cI just remember appreciating how lucky I was to have the opportunity to still be playing baseball,\u201d Schoch said. In Morgantown, West Virginia, the UVa diving teams were competing in NCAA qualifying events. Walker Creedon, a sophomore at the time, excelled on the big stage. Creedon finished first on the men\u2019s platform to punch his ticket to the NCAA Championships for the second consecutive year. After the event, the team seemed extremely optimistic about the future. \u201cWalker did a great job competing and winning the event today,\u201d head diving coach Drew Livingston said in a release after the event. \u201cIt seems like he\u2019s been getting better at every meet on platform this season, so we\u2019re looking forward to keeping the momentum up heading into the championships.\u201d The Virginia men\u2019s tennis also competed on March 11, 2020. The Cavaliers beat William & Mary 7-0 to extend their winning streak to six consecutive matches ahead of ACC play. They were peaking at the right time. Head coach Andres Pedroso was aware of the looming threat of COVID-19, but he tried to keep his team in the moment in what turned out to be the final match of the season. \u201cThere was a lot of uncertainty around that match and whether it would be our last match or whether the season would keep going,\u201d Pedroso said. \u201cWe were just trying to keep the blinders on and focus on the match and assume that we were gonna keep competing.\u201d Pedroso\u2019s squad learned the next day that all NCAA winter and spring sport competitions were canceled. The baseball team was traveling to Pittsburgh on March 12 when it learned of the season being shut down. The team was in a mall in Maryland, stopping to grab lunch, when they heard it was time to turn around and head back to Charlottesville. \u201cI guess it\u2019ll always be talked about, where were you when it shut down?\u201d baseball head coach Brian O\u2019Connor said. \u201cI ended up being in a massage chair somewhere in Maryland.\u201d While March 11 was filled with hope, March 12 held heartbreak for many of UVa\u2019s student-athletes and coaches. \u201cI just remember thinking like coming to Virginia, I wanted to come here and play against the best and tough teams I never played before and things like that,\u201d Schoch said. \u201cI just remember thinking, 'Man, I don\u2019t really want my last game of my college career to be one I played against UMass Lowell and didn\u2019t do my best.'\u201d Fortunately for Schoch and others, the NCAA extended eligibility relief to allow student-athletes to return for another season. Virginia sports eventually returned on Sept. 12 when the Cavaliers' women\u2019s soccer defeated Virginia Tech 3-1. After a long hiatus due to the pandemic, UVa sports were back. After experiencing last year\u2019s devastation, Virginia\u2019s athletic programs feel a sense of gratitude for this year\u2019s events. COVID-19 still leads to postponements and cancellations as uncertainty remains, but unlike last spring, teams expect to compete through the end of the spring. A year ago, there was cautious optimism on March 11. Those feelings have returned after a turbulent past 12 months. \u201cI just hope that we never have to encounter something like that again,\u201d O\u2019Connor said.","799":"The Virginia men\u2019s basketball team\u2019s run in the ACC Tournament is over. Whether the Cavaliers\u2019 season is over remains to be seen. Friday\u2019s ACC Tournament semifinal game between UVa and Georgia Tech was canceled due to a positive COVID-19 test within the Cavaliers\u2019 program. The ACC announced the cancellation of the game Friday morning, less than 24 hours after Virginia\u2019s thrilling, last-second win over Syracuse in the ACC Tournament quarterfinals. \u201cWe went from an exhilarating game-winning shot to beat Syracuse to a gut punch regarding the positive COVID-19 test within our program,\u201d Virginia coach Tony Bennett said in a statement. \u201cI\u2019m hurting for our players, especially our seniors. I told our young men they have every reason to be disappointed, but it is still very important how they choose to respond.\u201d Whether the Cavaliers have a chance to respond in the NCAA Tournament remains in question. To compete in the NCAA Tournament this season, all members of a program\u2019s traveling party must have seven consecutive negative COVID-19 tests before they can travel to Indiana, the site of this year\u2019s tournament. With the NCAA Tournament set to tip off March 19, that could prove challenging for the Cavaliers. \u201cWe are exhausting all options to participate in the NCAA Tournament,\u201d Bennett said. One of those potential options could be to play with a limited roster in the NCAA Tournament. The NCAA\u2019s senior vice president of basketball, Dan Gavitt, said recently that as long as a team has five healthy players, it can compete in the NCAA Tournament. \u201cThe committee talked about this weeks ago, wrestled with contingencies, and thought it was fairest for a team that had a great season, earned their way to play in this tournament, that even if they were to be compromised in some way, if they have those five players, they still should have the opportunity to compete rather than be replaced,\u201d Gavitt said. \u201cIf they fall below the threshold of five [players], of course they would not be able to play by playing rules, nor by tournament protocols.\u201d Whether Virginia would have enough players to compete in the Big Dance following the completion of contact tracing from the most recent positive COVID-19 test was not immediately clear. In a statement, Virginia athletics director Carla Williams said the school is \u201cin communication with the appropriate officials regarding our participation\u201d in the NCAA Tournament. \u201cThis is incredibly disappointing for our players,\u201d Williams said. \u201cThey have done what has been asked of them in very challenging circumstances. It is unfortunate the ACC Tournament has concluded for us, but we have turned our attention to the NCAA Tournament.\u201d The Cavaliers became the second team to pull out of the ACC Tournament this week due to a positive COVID-19 test. On Thursday, the Duke men\u2019s basketball team had to withdraw from the tournament following a positive test, ending its season. The ACC Tournament isn\u2019t the only conference tournament that has been affected by COVID-19 issues. Perennial national power Kansas was removed from the Big 12 Tournament on Friday following the positive test of a player, leaving the Jayhawks\u2019 NCAA Tournament hopes in question. With Virginia\u2019s departure, Georgia Tech advances to the ACC Tournament championship game. The Yellow Jackets will play the winner of Friday night\u2019s late Florida State-North Carolina game. Despite losing two teams to positive COVID-19 tests, the ACC Tournament will continue. \u201cI\u2019m heartbroken for our student-athletes, coaches and support staff at both Duke and Virginia,\u201d ACC Commissioner Jim Phillips said in a statement. \u201cOur teams have worked incredibly hard and sacrificed so much throughout this season. We continue to be led by our ACC Medical Advisory Group and the protocols put in place that have allowed our teams to safely compete during the 2020-21 season. We will follow the lead of our medical personnel to ensure the health and safety of our programs remain the top priority. Our student-athletes and schools have been remarkable this entire season while enduring incredibly challenging circumstances.\u201d","800":"The Virginia women\u2019s rowing team dominates its sport. The Cavaliers have won every ACC title since 2010, they won national championships in 2010 and 2012, and they\u2019ve been a fixture in the top 10 nationally for more than two decades. \u201cEvery now and then, you wonder like, oh, if I was playing basketball and we were this dominant everybody in the country would know about it,\u201d senior Sophia Kershner said. \u201cYou think about the dominant ACC sports teams and you think Duke basketball or UNC women\u2019s soccer or basketball, and we\u2019re on that list too, but it\u2019s not well known.\u201d Despite the success, the sport flies under the radar compared to some of UVa\u2019s other athletic programs. The team grinds, often early in the morning, to reach the top of the sport. After more than a year away from competition and intense offseason training despite uncertainty surrounding the spring season, the team returns to action Saturday for the Oak Ridge Cardinal Invite in Tennessee. Barring any COVID-19 complications \u2014 the team couldn\u2019t compete last weekend due to virus issues \u2014 the program will return to action seeking another successful spring. \u201cI\u2019m honored to coach them,\u201d Virginia head coach Kevin Sauer said. \u201cI think people just don\u2019t realize how much success we\u2019ve had, and also how hard we work. It\u2019s brutal.\u201d Rowing demands excellence. From physical endurance to rowers operating in sync, it\u2019s a challenging sport. Sauer praises the effort of his team, which has followed strict health protocols just for the chance to compete this spring. Among the many protocols during offseason training was distancing from teammates. Whether that meant during practice or after, it was a drastic change from the team\u2019s usual close-knit routines. \u201cThe fact that I can\u2019t go up to a teammate and like boost them up, and I can\u2019t have a teammate around for dinner or can\u2019t hug a teammate if they\u2019ve had a bad day is heartbreaking,\u201d senior Abbie Bird said. Health protocols made the tough practices even more difficult for the team. Both Bird and Kershner shared that they questioned the offseason training. They wondered why they were putting in so much work, knowing that the season might not even happen. As much time as they gave to their training routines, a voice in the back of their heads always wondered if they\u2019d get the chance to compete. \u201cThat fear \u2026 and underlying presence of OK, but what if this happens again, and prepping to be devastated hasn\u2019t really gone away, and I don\u2019t think it will,\u201d Kershner said. Even with the emotional scars of last spring still there, the team embraced the little moments before this season. Sophie mentioned that the team spends hours upon hours training just for a race that can last as little as seven minutes. That process encourages love of practice. The Cavaliers try to find joy in little moments when training and competing. \u201cSome of the sunrises we saw were amazing,\u201d Sauer said of early morning preseason practices. \u201cJust stuff like that, they embrace that.\u201d For Kershner, some of her best moments at UVa weren\u2019t in races that counted or championship events. \u201cMy favorite memories of this team that I\u2019ll take with me away from college and through life and the friendships I\u2019ve built, those were built at practice,\u201d Kershner said. \u201cThose were built in the small, unscripted moments in the boathouse and Kevin goofing off on the water.\u201d Races aren\u2019t guaranteed this spring. The Cavaliers know anything can be canceled at a moment\u2019s notice due to COVID-19. When the races arrive, Virginia will enjoy them. They Cavaliers will also be sure to cherish every moment at practice with teammates. After a spring away from the team, even an uncertain spring together \u2013 albeit often from a distance \u2013 is an improvement. \u201cI can\u2019t say one or two silver linings because it actually is the small things that make it the best thing,\u201d Bird said.","801":"GREENSBORO, N.C. \u2014 College basketball royals Virginia, Duke and Kansas withdrew from their respective conference tournaments this week because of COVID-19 cases, imperiling or, in the Blue Devils\u2019 case, dooming their NCAA Tournament aspirations. Which prompts a very reasonable question: Given the seven days of negative virus tests required prior before traveling to Indianapolis for the national tournament, why in the name of John Wooden would you stage league championships so close to Selection Sunday? As is often the case \u2014 or is it always? \u2014 the answers revolve around television and money. But before shouting for the ongoing conference events to be canceled, understand that Duke\u2019s exit from the ACC Tournament on Thursday, followed Friday by Virginia\u2019s from the ACC and Kansas\u2019 from the Big 12, were not necessarily caused by traveling to Greensboro or Kansas City. Medical experts say it can take up to a week after exposure before a person tests positive, meaning these transmissions could have occurred elsewhere \u2014 the Duke and UVa campuses have seen recent upticks in virus cases. For example, Virginia bused to the ACC Tournament late Tuesday afternoon, defeated Syracuse in Thursday\u2019s quarterfinals and experienced a positive result in postgame testing. The Cavaliers\u2019 semifinal Friday against Georgia Tech was scratched about six hours before tipoff, on the anniversary of last year\u2019s tournament shutdown. Syracuse reported Friday night that all its players tested negative and will not be required to quarantine. Commuting to Greensboro from its season-long bubble in Durham, Duke beat Boston College on Tuesday and Louisville on Wednesday. But a subsequent positive test forced the Blue Devils to quarantine and withdraw from their Thursday quarterfinal versus Florida State. Out of an abundance of caution, did conference officials consider scrapping Friday\u2019s North Carolina-Florida State semifinal and Saturday\u2019s title game to protect UNC, FSU and Georgia Tech? After all, each of those teams, COVID permitting, is assured of an NCAA bid. When the NCAA established its tournament calendar and protocols, did the ACC explore adjusting its championship dates to give teams a longer runway to the national tournament in Indianapolis? While leaning heavily on medical advisors, I would have seriously pondered both options. A sober explanation of this whirlwind would have been welcomed from ACC commissioner Jim Phillips, on the job since Feb. 1. The timing of his arrival, during a pandemic and late in a basketball season rife with disruptions, is an unfortunate burden, but he\u2019s yet to grant any interviews beyond the conference\u2019s television network. Friday was another opportunity to answer questions and offer transparency. Instead, he issued a tame statement expressing empathy for UVa and Duke. Absent further advancement in Greensboro, Duke was not ticketed for the NCAA Tournament. Regular-season champion Virginia is, and the overarching concern is whether the Cavaliers can travel to Indianapolis and pursue a second consecutive national title. \u201cWe are exhausting all options to participate in the NCAA Tournament,\u201d UVa coach Tony Bennett said in a statement. Virginia did not share details of its virus case, but contact tracing could be paramount. Will local health guidelines force lengthy quarantining of players, even if they continue to test negative? As during the regular season, athletes and coaches at the ACC men\u2019s and women\u2019s basketball tournaments wore\/are wearing Kinexon tracing devices, sewn into jerseys or tucked into socks for games. That data is critical. The NCAA Tournament roster minimum is five available players, and teams have until 11 p.m. on Saturday to inform the association if they are unable to meet that standard. The 68-team bracket will be unveiled Sunday evening, with First Four games scheduled for Thursday and the 32 opening-round contests for Friday and Saturday. Atlantic 10 commissioner Bernadette McGlade serves on the 10-member NCAA selection committee, and her conference\u2019s decision to stage the first four rounds of its tournament last week looks more shrewd by the moment. The league still must sweat Sunday\u2019s title game at the University of Dayton between VCU and St. Bonaventure, but at least the Rams and Bonnies spent this week in their home bubbles to minimize risk and address any issues. The A-10 did not move its Selection Sunday tournament final because of the national CBS television exposure, and far more lucrative media contracts explain why leagues such as the ACC, Big Ten, Big East and Big 12 did not move their tournaments. The NCAA could have delayed its tournament to give conferences more time to meet testing standards, but the NCAA\u2019s television deal with CBS\/Turner is worth approximately $1 billion annually, and the networks were not eager to adjust their traditional schedules. We can only hope that money grab does not nuke the entire event. Georgia Tech coach Josh Pastner was on a routine Zoom with ESPN\u2019s Jay Bilas and Dan Shulman on Friday morning to advance the Yellow Jackets\u2019 semifinal against Virginia when the ACC called with news of the cancellation. He said the Yellow Jackets never considered \u201cfor a second\u201d bailing on the league tournament for safety reasons ahead of time, or Friday. He said they relished an opportunity to play UVa, the lone ACC program they have not beaten in his five seasons as coach. \u201cBut we do have to protect ourselves,\u201d Pastner said. The ACC is housing teams at two large hotels, with Georgia Tech and Virginia both assigned the Grandover Resort, about a mile from conference headquarters. Pastner instructed his players to ride elevators by themselves and interact with family only outside while wearing masks. \u201cIt\u2019s awful, and it stinks,\u201d Pastner said, \u201cbut it\u2019s the only way to protect the bubble. We\u2019ve tried to do everything we can, but you have to get a little lucky along the way. \u2026 We\u2019re at this point where we\u2019ve just got to get to the finish line, and the finish line is we\u2019ve got to get on that plane \u2026 to Indianapolis. \u201cAnd we\u2019re right there, and we \u2026 have a chance tomorrow to win a championship. So we want to do that. You\u2019re trying to handle that and then get on that plane to get to Indianapolis. It\u2019s kind of a two-fold deal.\u201d Do Virginia\u2019s issues cause Pastner any anxiety? \u201cAnxiety\u2019s an understatement,\u201d he said. Imagine Tony Bennett\u2019s. David Teel reports for The Richmond Times-Dispatch.","802":"University of Virginia officials are again easing COVID-19 related restrictions on student gatherings as the number of virus cases and percentage of positive test results continue to decrease. As of Friday, students are allowed to gather outdoors in groups of up to 10 people and to eat in groups of four, providing everyone wears masks and stays six feet away from one another. Indoor gatherings remain limited at six people with masks and distancing required. \u201cAs a result of falling case numbers and positivity rates in our community, university leaders and public health experts are ready to ease some COVID-19 restrictions in an effort to make it a little easier for people to live, learn and work here safely and enjoyably,\u201d the announcement signed by top administrators and emailed to students on Thursday reads. The email was signed by UVa President Jim Ryan, Provost Liz Magill, Chief Operating Officer J.J. Davis and Dr. Mitch Rosner, chairman of the UVa Department of Medicine. \u201cThese changes are good news and a direct response to the much-improved conditions at UVa,\u201d the statement reads. \u201cThey are not a sign, however, that we are completely out of the woods. The threat of another spike in cases remains real, and if trends worsen, we will have to impose more strict public health measures again.\u201d The easing of restrictions came on the eve of the UVa men\u2019s basketball team exiting the ACC Tournament due to a positive COVID-19 test within the program. Students have faced a variety of restrictions since starting school Feb. 1. The semester began with a six-person gathering limit, mask mandate and social distancing requirement. By Feb. 16, nearly 650 students had tested positive for the virus, with a high of 229 cases reported that day alone. That prompted administrators to restrict students to residences except for trips to class, food and work. Off-Grounds students were prohibited from coming onto the campus except to attend classes. Students were only allowed to dine in groups of two, recreational facilities were shuttered and libraries were closed with only contactless pickup and drop-off. According to the UVa COVID tracker, during the 10-day crackdown, COVID-19 cases dropped from a seven-day average of 109 cases per day on Feb. 20 to a seven-day average of 28 daily cases by Feb. 28. As of Wednesday, UVa had a seven-day average of three new cases per day. Administrators said the February surge was due to the entire student body\u2019s general noncompliance with restrictions and not directly related to any one event or series of events. Within 10 days of the lockdown, new cases dropped to 26 in a day and positivity rates for tests also dropped, leading administrators to loosen the restrictions. Students were allowed to gather in sextets, although they could still only dine together in pairs. Libraries and recreation centers also reopened. \u201cIt is critical that we all continue to adhere to all public health measures, including mask requirements, gathering limitations, travel restrictions and physical distancing guidelines, even if you have been vaccinated or have previously contracted the virus,\u201d administrators wrote in the most recent letter. \u201cThe science around whether previous COVID-19 patients or those who have been vaccinated can contract the virus again and spread it to others again is inconclusive,\u201d they wrote. \u201cPeople who contract COVID-19 may shed the virus for a period of time that extends past the alleviation of symptoms or a positive test.\u201d The mask and social distance restrictions remain in place for those who have been vaccinated, the administrators said. \u201cFellow UVa community members have no way of knowing which people have been vaccinated or have previously tested positive,\u201d the letter states. \u201cUniversal adherence will avoid anxiety and potential conflict.\u201d The administrators \u201cstrongly encouraged\u201d students, staff and faculty to \u201cstick to pods or social bubbles and to avoid intermingling groups.\u201d \u201cWhile gathering limits do not apply to students living together in a single living arrangement, they apply when any members of a household gather with individuals beyond their living arrangement,\u201d administrators admonished. \u201cIn other words, eight people who live together in a house may only gather outdoors with two others who do not live in the house.\u201d The change also allows members of the UVa community to resume volunteer efforts, providing the organization they serve has a COVID-19 risk mitigation plan. The changes also follow state guidelines for outdoor sporting events, which limit seating to 30% of venue capacity or 1,000 people, whichever is less. Students, staff and faculty wishing to be vaccinated must sign up with the Virginia Department of Health and follow eligibility protocols, the message notes. \u201cYour continued vigilance is the only thing preventing another spike, particularly as we are still learning about new variants and whether people who have been vaccinated can transmit the virus,\u201d the administrators wrote. \u201cAfter a difficult year and a difficult start to the semester, we are heading in the right direction.\u201d","803":"GREENSBORO, N.C. \u2014 It took fewer than 24 hours for COVID-19 to erase the joy the Virginia men\u2019s basketball team felt after Reece Beekman\u2019s buzzer-beater toppled Syracuse. A day after advancing to the ACC Tournament semifinals with Beekman\u2019s heroics, the Cavaliers left Greensboro in a somber mood. Instead of battling Georgia Tech for a spot in the ACC Tournament championship game, a positive COVID-19 test result sent the Cavaliers back to Charlottesville. It also left the ACC a bit stunned, especially after Duke\u2019s virus-induced departure Thursday. North Carolina head coach Roy Williams even considered not playing Friday night against FSU, noting Virginia\u2019s departure and the desire to be healthy for the NCAA Tournament. \u201cI did think about it, but I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any great answer,\u201d Williams said. \u201cI mean, I really don\u2019t. It\u2019s sort of like, \u2018Don\u2019t play football.\u2019 Well, you can get hurt trying to cross the street.\u201d Williams stressed that it\u2019s a \u201cdifficult time\u201d for everyone, but with no perfect decision on the table his team played. Skipping the semifinal game wouldn\u2019t necessarily decrease the team\u2019s risk of contracting the virus. Unlike Williams, Florida State head coach Leonard Hamilton spent no time Friday wondering if his team should drop out of the conference tournament after UVa\u2019s disappointing news. The Seminoles played, taking down UNC 69-66 to earn a spot in the ACC Tournament championship game. \u201cThese kids have made such a tremendous sacrifice all year and our kids have been tremendous,\u201d Hamilton said. \u201cFor me to not want to play because of somebody else\u2019s unfortunate challenge, I thought would be tremendously unfair and disrespectful to the ACC and to the team, North Carolina\u00a0\u2014 who wanted to play\u00a0\u2014 and for the sacrifices that our players have made.\u201d Hamilton and the Seminoles took note of the premature exits by Duke and UVa, though. They advanced to the tournament semifinals after Duke\u2019s exit, and the date with Georgia Tech in the finals came about in part due to UVa\u2019s leaving. \u201cIt\u2019s sad to see those teams go out with COVID,\u201d Florida State freshman guard Scottie Barnes said. The Seminoles dealt with a pair of COVID pauses in the regular season, missing four games due to virus issues within their own program. They\u2019ve been able to play in the postseason, however, testing negative for COVID-19 in recent days. \u201cIt just shows that regardless of what you\u2019re doing, you\u2019ve got to be a little lucky,\u201d Hamilton said. Georgia Tech benefited from UVa\u2019s departure, earning a spot in the conference title game. The Yellow Jackets were excited to qualify for the championship, but they wanted to earn their spot in the marquee game on the court. \u201cWe would have loved to play tonight,\u201d Georgia Tech head coach Josh Pastner said Friday. \u201cWe wanted another opportunity. You\u2019re playing Virginia; they\u2019re the defending national champions. They\u2019re the league champions.\u201d Pastner bumped into a couple members of UVa\u2019s coaching and support staff as the Cavaliers checked out of their hotel Friday morning. As Virginia\u2019s staff members left, Pastner shared well wishes and words of encouragement. For Georgia Tech\u2019s head coach, UVa represents one of the best programs in not only the league but in all of college hoops. Virginia is the only ACC team Pastner has never defeated while leading the Yellow Jackets, and he considers Tony Bennett a future Hall of Fame head coach. He wants the reigning national champions in the Big Dance, if it\u2019s deemed safe for them to make it to Indianapolis next week. \u201cI hope they get to play in the NCAA Tournament,\u201d Pastner said. \u201cIt would be devastating for them to not play. They deserve to be in the NCAA Tournament \u2026 we really hope they get to play for their student-athletes because they\u2019ve earned the right to be a really good seed and they\u2019re a really good team.\u201d UVa plans to exhaust all options to compete in the upcoming NCAA Tournament. Contact tracing and future COVID-19 test results will likely determine the Cavaliers' postseason fate. Virginia on top of the world Thursday afternoon. Friday morning, reality hit. COVID-19 remains a fierce opponent as teams try to navigate March. \u201cYou never know what\u2019s going to happen throughout these tough times,\u201d Barnes said Friday. \u201cYou\u2019ve just got to be grateful for every game that you
