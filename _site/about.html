    <h1 id="about-project-title">About [Project Title]</h1>

<p>What does equitable, empathy-driven digital education look like?</p>

<p>This is the question at the center of [Project Title].</p>

<p>[Project Title] examines university teaching, life, and governance during the COVID-19 pandemic. In an interactive digital story, it asks users to make choices that engage issues of equity, accessibility, and mental health. In an accompanying manifesto, It urges a whole-person approach to teaching, learning, and labor. And it holds space for reflection and feedback [in a way I would love to expound upon but don’t know how to yet].</p>

<h2 id="project-history">Project History</h2>

<p>[Project Title] was created by the tenth cohort of [Praxis Fellows] (http://praxis.scholarslab.org/) during the 2020-2021 academic year.</p>

<p>This year’s Praxis team members know one another as faces on computer screens, kind WhatsApp messages, and pings on Slack. We know one another’s pets and we’ve seen inside one another’s homes, but we haven’t met one another in person. This is because, like many UVA students and faculty, we have met remotely on Zoom during the 2020-2021 academic year. For this reason, we’ve been intentional about building community among ourselves and outlining how we want to work together. Our charter is a reflection of our commitments to integrity, community, equity, and play. [Project Title], similarly, grew out of these commitments, [as well as…]</p>

<p>[Project Title] is inspired by the digital teaching and learning practices that became necessary after the University of Virginia announced that it would be moving all classes online on March 11, 2020. It grew and changed based on conversations we began having as a group in September 2020 relating to our relationships with pedagogy, preconceptions about in-person and online learning, and what it might mean to change curricula to address questions of labor, accessibility, and equity. We watched Dr. Roopika Risam’s lecture on abolitionist digital pedagogy, reviewed curricula and syllabi from our institution and others, and sought out other digital projects</p>

<p>Our project website makes ample use of the handwriting and illustrations of praxis fellows:</p>

<p>This is Grace’s handwriting.
This is Emma’s handwriting.
This is Elise’s handwriting.
This is Crystal’s handwriting.
This is Savanna’s handwriting. 
And this is Aaron’s handwriting.</p>

<p>We wanted the project to feel handcrafted, because it is – [Project Title] is shaped by the hands, intentions, experiences, and biases of its makers.</p>

<h2 id="project-goals">Project Goals</h2>

<p>The goals of [Project Title] are to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Create empathy-driven community</li>
  <li>Compel action and decision-making</li>
  <li>Remind each visitor to this site of our interconnectedness</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="contributors">Contributors</h2>

<p>The 2020-2021 Praxis Fellows are Grace Alvino, Emma Dove, Elise Foote, Crystal Luo, Savanna Morrison, and Aaron Thompson.</p>

<p>Grace Alvino edited every word of copy on the [Project Title] website. She is a Ph.D. student in the English department.</p>

<p>Emma Dove helped develop the website and worked on the Twine story. She is a Ph.D. student in the joint program in Art &amp; Architectural History.</p>

<p>Elise Foote helped develop the website and often kept beautiful notes during group meetings. She is a Ph.D. student in the English department.</p>

<p>Crystal Luo penned the manifesto. She is a Ph.D. student in the History department.</p>

<p>Savanna Morrison wrote the script, helped ensure the project’s accessibility, and pushed us all to center unknowing and contemplative pedagogy. She is a Ph.D. in the music department.</p>

<p>Aaron Thompson gathered the data that underpins this project. His cat, Lev, also helped. He is a Ph.D. student in the Slavic Languages and Literatures department.</p>

<p>[Project Title] was made possible by the tireless efforts and unyielding support of the Scholars’ Lab Staff and the broader UVA Library. Special thanks to:</p>

<p>Brandon Walsh, for your constant encouragement and mentorship, for leading the Praxis Program in healthy directions, and for caring so deeply about pedagogy..</p>

<p>Shane Lin, for sharing your boundless knowledge of DH history and praxis, for your sense of humor, for helping us host movie nights on Discord, and for sharing many excellent pictures of Hazel.</p>

<p>Jeremy Boggs, for centering accessibility and care for others in your design thinking and teaching, and for being an excellent Dungeons and Dragons Master.</p>

<p>Amanda Visconti, for generously sharing Maple with us on Zoom meetings, for modeling healthy and equitable leadership, and for sharing knowledge and events with us generously.</p>

<p>Ronda Grizzle, for leading conversations that helped us form bonds as a group, for helping us ground our charter in our shared values, and for sharing your vast knowledge of project management.</p>

<p>Ammon Shepherd</p>

<p>Arin Bennett</p>

<p>Drew MacQueen</p>

<p>Laura Miller</p>

<p>[Project Title] also benefited greatly from the input of:</p>

<p>Mackenzie Brooks, Washington and Lee</p>

<p>Katina Rogers, CUNY</p>

<p>Cihan Tekay, CUNY</p>

<p>Dave (lastname?), RE: Grants - to Dave, we are sorry that we introduced one another to you. This process of introduction led us to gush about one another, and probably made you uncomfortable.</p>

<p>Brandon Butler, for teaching us about intellectual property (in an actually fun and approachable way).</p>

<p>Lauren Work for teaching us about project sustainability (and how to enable closed captioning while presenting using Google Slides)!</p>

<h2 id="the-scholars-lab">The Scholars’ Lab</h2>
<p>[I stole this description from Unclosure – I’m sure we can add and change words, but I also want to credit those authors]</p>

<p>[The Scholars’ Lab] (https://scholarslab.lib.virginia.edu/) was established in 2006 by the [University of Virginia Library] (https://www.library.virginia.edu/) as a site for innovation in the humanities and social sciences. The Scholars’ Lab is a place where faculty and students can explore digital resources, find expert help, and collaborate on innovative research projects. The SLab also hosts events such as workshops, talks, and roundtables, and sponsors the [Praxis Program] (https://scholarslab.lib.virginia.edu/praxis-program-fellowships/) and the [Digital Humanities Fellows Program] (https://scholarslab.lib.virginia.edu/digital-humanities-fellows/).</p>

<h2 id="the-praxis-program">The Praxis Program</h2>
<p>[I stole this description from Unclosure – I’m sure we can add and change words, but I also want to credit those authors]</p>

<p>Each year, the Scholars’ Lab funds a cohort of doctoral students from across the Graduate School of Arts &amp; Sciences to serve as Praxis Fellows for the academic year. During the fall semester, fellows receive training in [digital methods and tools] (https://github.com/scholarslab/CodeLab) as well as in collaborative project management. During the spring semester, fellows conceive, design, build, and publish a digital project. This year, the Scholars’ Lab charged the Praxis Fellows with creating a project focused on digital pedagogy.</p>
